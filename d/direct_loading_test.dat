40|$|This {{work has}} {{concentrated}} on the testing of induction machines to determine their temperature rise at full-load without mechanically coupling to a load machine. The achievements of this work are outlined as follows. 1. Four distinct categories of mixed-frequency test using an inverter have been identified by the author. The simulation results of these tests {{as well as the}} conventional 2 -supply test have been analysed in detail. 2. Experimental work on mixed-frequency tests has been done on a small (4 kW) squirrel cage induction machine using a voltage source PWM inverter. Two out of the four categories of test suggested have been tested and the temperature rise results were found to be similar to the results of a <b>direct</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> Further, one of the categories of test proposed has been performed on a 3. 3 kW slip-ring induction machine for the conformation of the rotor values. 3. A low current supply mixed-frequency test-rig has been proposed. For this purpose, a resonant bank was connected to the DC link of the inverter {{in order to maintain the}} exchange of power between the test machine and the resonant bank instead of between the main supply and the test machine. The resonant bank was then replaced with a special electro-mechanical energy storage unit. The current of the main power supply was then reduced in amplitude. 4. A variable inertia test for full load temperature rise testing of induction machines has been introduced. This test is purely mechanical in nature and does not require any electrical connection of the test machine to any other machine. It has the advantage of drawing very little net power from the supply...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an in situ parameter estimation method {{to determine the}} equivalent circuit parameters of the Synchronous Machines. The parameters of synchronous generator, both cylindrical rotor and salient pole rotor, are estimated based on the circuit model. Genetic algorithm based parameter estimation technique is adopted where only one set of in-situ measured <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data is used. Conventional methods viz., EMF, MMF, Potier triangle method uses rated voltage and rated current obtained {{from more than one}} operating condition to determine the parameters. However, Genetic Algorithm (GA) based method uses the working voltage and load current of a single operating point obtained from in-situ measured <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data to estimate the parameters.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} two different finite element analysis of three-phase induction motors. The first method is based on the equivalent circuit of the motor. The field solutions reproduce the indirect (no load and locked rotor) tests, to determine the parameters of the equivalent circuit. The second method, based only on the field solution, reproduces the <b>direct</b> (<b>load)</b> <b>tests.</b> It combines the field solution with the circuital one, imposing the motor voltage directly. Both approaches work with a two-dimensional discretised domain and are applied to a 4 poles and three-phase induction motor. The results are shown by means of figures and tables. From the comparison useful considerations about the finite element analysis of the induction motor can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|The Colombo {{bridge was}} built across the Mannu river in Sardinia, (Italy) between 1966 - 68. This bridge {{consists}} of 15 spans, each 15 m in length, 12 of these span the Mannu river and 3 span a railway. The bridge deck is constructed out of precast pretensioned concrete I-beams, 0. 80 m spacing with overlaid precast parts. It {{is based on}} a continuous pier cap, which is supported by 4 piers, each made of 2 circular columns. Continuous foundation beams distribute loads down to 0. 60 m reinforced concrete piles. In 1992 serious static damage was identified and the 2 circular columns were connected together, thus becoming a unique structure. In 2002 due to increased heavy traffic, serious static risk and serious deterioration of the building materials, a total renovation of the structure including all structural aspects, from bridge deck to foundation piles was undertaken. Core samples of the concrete from the piers and foundation were examined and reinforcing rebars mapped, <b>direct</b> <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> on the foundation piles were also carried out.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the impact protection capacity of armor material quantitatively, <b>direct</b> impact <b>testing</b> <b>loaded</b> by modified Hopkinson bar was used to simulate the impaction between penetrator and armor. Protection coefficient k was defined to describe the protective performance. Using the direct impact testing, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V specimens with different microstructure and thickness were tested. Results show that k decreases with increased impact velocity and increases with increased thickness of specimen. Under a given loading condition, binary microstructure exhibits the highest k, indicating the best protective performance. Moreover, its k shows the most sensitivity to thickness (mt) and the least sensitivity to impact energy (me), which means that its protective performance can be improved most efficiently by increasing its thickness and it will exhibit good protective performance in a wider impact velocity range. This new method can evaluate the impact protective properties of armor materials efficiently, which may have a broad application prospect...|$|R

40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the proof <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the <b>test</b> that the <b>load</b> does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> a series of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop proof <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges proof <b>load</b> <b>tested</b> in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> or the rapid <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> may not be necessarily inferior to the static <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> considering cost and time performance of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems face {{continuously}} evolving field workloads {{in terms}} of activated/disabled feature sets, varying usage patterns and changing deployment configura-tions. These evolving workloads often have a large impact {{on the performance of}} a ULS system. Hence, continuous <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> is critical to ensuring the error-free operation of such systems. A common challenge facing performance analysts is to validate if a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> closely resembles the current field workloads. Such validation may be performed by comparing execution logs from the <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and the field. However, the size and unstructured nature of execution logs makes such a comparison unfeasible without automated support.
