5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean in the <b>direction</b> of that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite <b>direction.</b> This {{is often referred to}} as countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the <b>direction</b> of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered <b>direction</b> and toward the <b>direction</b> of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5000|$|Railroad <b>directions</b> {{are used}} to {{describe}} train <b>directions</b> on rail systems. The terms used may be derived from such sources as compass <b>directions,</b> altitude <b>directions,</b> or other <b>directions.</b> However, the railroad <b>directions</b> frequently vary from the actual <b>directions,</b> so that, for example, a [...] "northbound" [...] train may really be headed west over some segments of its trip, or a train going [...] "down" [...] may actually be increasing its elevation. Railroad <b>directions</b> are often specific to system, country, or region.|$|R
5000|$|Most railroads in the United States use nominal {{cardinal}} <b>directions</b> for the <b>directions</b> {{of their}} lines, which often differ from actual compass <b>directions.</b> These <b>directions</b> are {{often referred to}} as [...] "railroad" [...] north, south, east, or west, to avoid confusion with the compass <b>directions.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any <b>direction.</b> It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific <b>direction</b> by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single <b>direction</b> with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing <b>direction.</b> The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of <b>direction.</b> One is geodetic precession: the axis <b>direction</b> of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the <b>direction</b> of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a <b>direction</b> as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E

5|$|So <b>direction</b> 0 {{indicates}} the worm continues to travel straight ahead, <b>direction</b> 1 {{indicates the}} worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in <b>direction</b> 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in <b>direction</b> 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in <b>direction</b> 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E

5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any <b>direction</b> and to move the {{flashing}} cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a <b>direction</b> in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the <b>direction</b> he is moving, making <b>direction</b> selection unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|Recognizing linear {{information}} in some selective <b>directions</b> is required sometimes in image processing.

Traditionally the results of directional filtering in these <b>directions</b> are presented in separate images, which is inefficient in revealing the relationships between linear features in these <b>directions.</b> In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses a neural system to coordinate all the results from directional filtering in several <b>directions</b> to produce an integrated image that presents the enhanced linear features in {{one or more of these}} <b>directions.</b> The synthetic and real examples presented in this paper prove that the combination of neural system and directional filtering is useful for linear feature enhancement...|$|R

5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session.

If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated <b>direction</b> does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated <b>direction</b> is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored.
