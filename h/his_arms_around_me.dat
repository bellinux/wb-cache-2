500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E

Instead, he [...] "wrote pure Stravinsky", and the band did not feel at all comfortable with the score initially. [...] "After the very first rehearsal, at which we were all so embarrassed we were nearly crying because nobody could read, he walked over and put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Ah, what a beautiful family you have.'" ...|$|R

60|$|As I have said, {{there was}} never such a lover as he. No girl could live in a {{university}} town till she was twenty-four and not have love experiences. I had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray professors, and by the athletes and the football giants. But {{not one of them}} made love to me as Ernest did. His arms were around me before I knew. His lips were on mine before I could protest or resist. Before his earnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous. He swept me off my feet by the splendid invincible rush of him. He did not propose. He put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and kissed me and took it for granted that we should be married. There was no discussion about it. The only discussion--and that arose afterward--was when we should be married.|$|E

Each song I was coming up with began to sound like the style of some favorite artist of mine from the past... Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, Billie Holliday, the old Chicago soul of The Emotions and the new Chicago vibe of Kanye West... Ice Cube's bumpin' in the trunk vibe and of course, Rick James. It's all in there." ...|$|E
5000|$|In September 1972, Flack {{was opening}} for Marvin Gaye at the Greek Theater; after {{performing}} her prepared encore song, Flack was advised by Gaye to sing an additional song. Flack later said, [...] "I said well, I got this song I've {{been working on}} called 'Killing Me Softly...' and he said 'Do it, baby.' And I did it and the audience went crazy, and {{he walked over to}} <b>me</b> and put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Baby, don't ever do that song again live until you record it.|$|R
5000|$|Sherman {{became a}} {{licensed}} jockey in 1957. [...] His first win was at Hollywood Park. [...] In 1959, {{he won a}} race in Maryland where then Vice President Richard Nixon awarded the trophy, attracting national attention. [...] The highlight of Sherman's career came when he beat his idol and future Hall of Fame jockey Eddie Arcaro in a race. [...] "I'll never forget that because after the race he came by and put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'You run a good race, son,'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] He won over 2,000 races during his riding career. [...] After riding for over 21 years, he retired from riding as a jockey and began training horses.|$|R

I thought I was walking out by the pleasant shore, and everything seemed so strangely beautiful, and grandpapa and grandmamma were there, and Moses had come home, and you were there, {{and we were all}} so happy. And then I felt a sort of strange sense that something was coming--some great trial or affliction--and I groaned and clung to Moses, and asked him to put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and hold me.|$|R
5000|$|While Mayer seldom {{discussed}} his early life, his partiality towards Canada would sometimes be revealed, especially after Canada and America entered World War II. On one occasion in 1943, Mary Pickford {{called to tell}} him she met a movie-struck Royal Canadian Air Force pilot from New Brunswick, where Mayer grew up. Mayer asked her to have him drop by the studio. The pilot, Charles Foster, recalled his visit: [...] "Mary's driver took me through the gates, and I saw this little man come running down {{the steps of the}} Thalberg Building. I thought, 'Oh, he's sent a man to greet me.' And I got out of the car, and this man threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Welcome to my studio.' [...] " ...|$|E

5000|$|Willem was {{the third}} {{in a family of}} five children. His two {{brothers}} Jacob and Matthijs Maris preceded him as painters. In literature he is often characterized as a self-taught man, and Maris described his early study years as follows: [...] "From the time I was young I worked outdoors. Even before I was twelve I would sit in the meadow and watch the cows before and after school. As my brothers were older than me, naturally I got part of my training from them, and in the winters I went to the Academy of Art, where I often drew from plaster models and also often practiced drawing in perspective. In the summer I always studied outdoors, and in the winter in the stable." [...] Maris also received advice from the cattle painter Pieter Stortenbeker, who gave him work to copy.In 1862, Maris made his debut with Cows on the Heath, which may have been painted in Oosterbeek, which he visited {{for the first time that}} year. It was in Oosterbeek that he met Gerard Bilders and Anton Mauve. Maris would write about his legendary meeting with Mauve: [...] a couple of days afterwards I was sitting somewhere and painting-when one of these braggarts came up behind me. Well, hey, when you're young, you don't think that's very nice. And suddenly the guy throws <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and roars: 'I sit here all day long plodding away with a pencil -scratching and scratching-and you get it right away!' It was ... Mauve. [...] They would remain good friends for the rest of their lives.In 1863, the Mauve family moved and set a studio where all the three brothers could work. As his brothers had done before him, Willem also took a trip along the Rhine. Later he shared a studio with Bernard Blommers, and Matthijs Maris and Anton Mauve could often be found there. In the Mauritshuis, Willem copied the works of Paulus Potter, a seventeenth-century cattle painter who also inspired Gerard Bilders, Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch and the Barbizon painters.|$|E

The shoot was highly secretive, but {{according}} to producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a crew of 150 Americans and [...] "several dozen local Egyptians" [...] ensured a [...] "remarkably smooth" [...] shoot. Bay earned the Egyptian government's approval to film at the pyramids by contacting Zahi Hawass, whom Bay said [...] "put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Don't hurt my pyramids.

5000|$|Where {{the hell}} do any of you get off, telling me I sold out? Where do you get off? Where {{do you find the}} nerve, to call me a whore? You think I hate ECW? I love that place. I love that place! But ECW simply didn't love me back. She was like the girl I can't let go off, but the one who makes me sick, upon seeing her. She wanted too much blood, too much of my heart, too much of my life! So I left, and I found fame and fortune in WWE. And Paul Heyman was right. There's only one real {{difference}} between me and Tommy Dreamer. I'm a whore, and he's not. You see, seven years ago, I pulled the sock out of my pants, and made Vince McMahon laugh, and the doors of opportunity open wide for Mick Foley, but not for Tommy Dreamer. All he's got is his heart, his pride and the initials ECW. And I wanted to tell Edge that I went back and I watched our WrestleMania match, the greatest hardcore match of all time, I said. Well the truth is, maybe it wasn't quite as good as I thought. Maybe Edge, you and I are gonna have to be tougher than ever, hungrier than ever, sicker than ever, to walk into that steaming cesspool that is the Hammerstein Ballroom. 2,500 sickening, twisted fans, screaming for our blood, because Tommy Dreamer can do everything I can, and maybe with more passion. He's gonna beat us up, all over New York City. He's gonna bludgeon us. Terry Funk, the greatest wrestler I ever saw. You look at Terry Funk and you see an old man, you're not seeing the real Terry Funk. His slaps are worse than most men's punches. His punches dole out concussions, and when he picks up a weapon, he can use it like no man ever has. He has an excruciating pain waking up every single day, looking for one more chance to have one great last match. I blew {{the son of a bitch}} up in Japan, and he came back and hugged me. I set him up on fire in Philadelphia, and he put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> He doesn't put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> anymore. I don't want your <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> Terry Funk. Tommy Dreamer, the only difference between me and you, is I have the guts to go to WWE. (At this point, a fan was audibly heard on the telecast telling Foley to shut up.) No, you shut your mouth! (pointing out to said fan) Because when I go to Hammerstein Ballroom, Edge and I are prepared to take the beatings of our lives, and I will do that to exorcise the sick, twisted whore that is ECW. I want her out of my life. You’ve seen me thrown off cells, you've seen me slammed in tacks, you've seen me go through a burning table at WrestleMania; it is nothing compared to the horrors I will unleash on Dreamer and Funk at (goddamn you) ECW. 'Cause I'm gonna stake the hearts of your heroes, and I'm gonna shove them down their throats for making me fall in love with you to begin with. You stepped on my heart, you stepped on my soul, you took everything I've had faith in, and you just throw it away. And then when I walk to that ring at the Hammerstein Ballroom as a WWE Legend, you Terry Funk and you Tommy Dreamer will learn about loss...Have a nice day. Mick Foley on his kayfabe thoughts on ECW ...|$|R

500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|R
5000|$|James Bierley {{was stabbed}} to death by Robert James Thornton on January 8, 1970 in Columbia, Missouri. Bierley and Thornton were neighbors {{residing}} in the same apartment building; in a statement he gave four days later, Thornton {{said he had been}} drinking when Bierley invited him upstairs to his room to watch television. After watching for half an hour, in Thornton's statement, [...] "Bierley started playing with <b>me</b> and put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> ... he started kissing me on the jaw ... I told him three or four times to quit what he was doing and he just kept on like he didn't hear me." [...] When Thornton attempted to leave, Bierley grabbed him and pulled him back into the room, where Thornton felt [...] "that he was trying to queer me and I just blew up and started stabbing him. He had not made any threats to me." [...] The initial charge was first degree murder, which the state dropped to manslaughter. Thornton was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. In an appeal ruling, the Missouri Court of Appeals noted that since the victim was attempting to commit a felony upon Thornton (sodomy was a felony offense under § 563.230 RSMo 1969), homicide could be justifiable (under § 559.040 RSMo 1969), but instead, because Thornton tried to hide the knife and denied the crime when questioned by police on the evening of January 8, that indicated a consciousness of guilt rather than justifiable homicide. The Appeals Court rejected the defense that Thornton {{was in a state of}} [...] "homosexual panic" [...] as the pair had been sitting in a small room together with the door open, there were no signs of a physical struggle, Bierley had no weapon and according to Thornton's statement, had not made any threats, and no other residents reported unusual noises or shouts.|$|R
