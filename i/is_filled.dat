5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} widely cited as an {{important}} early example of the realism for which Balzac became famous. Descriptions of Paris are one example: the novel <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> with actual locations, including the Palais Royal and the Notre Dame Cathedral. The narration and characters allude repeatedly to art and culture, from Gioachino Rossini's opera Tancredi to the statue of Venus de Milo.|$|E

5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
50|$|For case #4, we need {{to check}} the {{opposite}} 8-connected corners {{to see whether they}} <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> or not.

The other half is designated [...] "General", which can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> by either career employees or political appointments as desired by the administration. Due to the 10% limitation, most General positions <b>are</b> still <b>filled</b> by career appointees.|$|R
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E

50|$|In 1950s, {{there were}} still water {{channels}}, but every branch of these water channels <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with earth. With the establishment of factories in Guangzhou, the water system of Lychee Bay had become a cesspool. In 1980s, more and more water channels <b>were</b> <b>filled.</b> In 1992, the last water channel—from Panxi Restaurant (泮溪酒家) to Fengyuan Bridge (逢源桥) <b>was</b> <b>filled.</b> Lychee Bay disappeared.|$|R

5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} {{properties}} to lanthanides. The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> in the lanthanides. The first experimental {{evidence for the}} filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, {{suggesting}} that the canal had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of transporting goods to and from the complex.

50|$|The {{constitution}} originally {{provided that}} premature vacancies would <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> {{by a vote}} of the Senate. However, a candidate elected in this way would serve only until the next senatorial election, when the seat would come up for election along with the others scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>filled.</b> In 1929, the system was changed so that vacancies <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> by members of both houses voting together.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the smaller}} south end docks were closed in 1971 with Brunswick Dock {{remaining}} until closure in 1975. Many docks have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in to create land for buildings: at the Pier Head, an arena at Kings Dock, commercial estates at Toxteth and Harrington Docks and housing at Herculaneum Dock. In the north, some branch docks have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in to create land. Sandon and Wellington Docks have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in and <b>are</b> now {{the location of a}} sewage works.
