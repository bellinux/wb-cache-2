5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} chromatographic analysis (GC/MS) of the lipophilic fraction extracted from leaves, inflorescences and rhizomes of Silphium perfoliatum L. collected in 1998 - 2000. It was shown that the extracts of leaves and inflorescences are similar in composition, containing among their main constituents: α-amyrine (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13. 9 % of total components <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 11. 3 % <b>in</b> inflorescences), heptacosane (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7. 1 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7. 6 % <b>in</b> inflorescences), stigmasterol (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 8. 1 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 2 % <b>in</b> inflorescences), γ-sitosterol (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6. 9 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 2 % <b>in</b> inflorescences), β-amyrine (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4. 1 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 8 % <b>in</b> inflorescences), β-caryophyllene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 6 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1. 5 % in inflorescences), caryophyllene oxide (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4. 4 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 9 % in inflorescences), germacrene D (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13. 8 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9. 7 % in inflorescences) and α-pinene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3. 3 % <b>in</b> leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 4 % in inflorescences).

The following compounds can be counted among the dominant ones occurring in rhizome extracts: diterpene of labdane type - 16 -acetoxycarterochaetol (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 45 %) and sesquiterpenes - 7 -b-H-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9. 1 %), 7 -a-H-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10. 7 %), d-elemene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7. 6 %), isocomene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 6 %), germacrene D (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 2 %) and modhephene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 1 %) ...|$|R

5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is due to}} infections caused {{primarily}} by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites. Although {{there are more than}} 100 strains of infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible {{for the majority of the}} cases.

A causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing.|$|E

5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E

5|$|Around 06:00UTC, Bopha passed 100km (65mi) {{south of}} Babeldaob island in Palau while at its initial peak. Shortly {{thereafter}} {{it made its}} closest approach the nation, tracking roughly 55km (35mi) south of Angaur island. After clearing Palau, Bopha ultimately intensified further before making a devastating landfall on Mindanao in the Philippines. The JTWC estimated its peak intensity at 280km/h (175mph), a Category5 on the SSHWS. The storm resulted <b>in</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1,901fatalities {{in the country and}} tremendous infrastructural damage. Land interaction substantially weakened the system by the time it emerged over the Sulu Sea. Turning north, Bopha briefly weakened to a tropical storm on December6 before undergoing another period of rapid intensification. After reaching its tertiary peak on December7, hostile wind shear caused dramatic weakening. In a 24‑hour span, the typhoon's central pressure rose by 55mbar (hPa; 1.62inHg) while its winds fell from 170km/h (105mph) to 75km/h (45mph). Bopha soon degraded to a tropical depression and dissipated off the northwestern coast of Luzon early on December9.|$|E
