Reliability was greater for private than <b>for</b> public good <b>choices,</b> and greater <b>for</b> <b>choices</b> between a good and a monetary amount than <b>for</b> <b>choices</b> between two goods.

Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty.

5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection <b>for</b> <b>choice</b> assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
