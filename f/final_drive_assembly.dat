In the UK, the R1200GS has been subject to various DVSA vehicle recalls covering the front brakes, anti-lock braking system, throttle cable, fuel pump, clutch, <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> brake pipes, and gearbox; and similar recalls have been issued in other countries. Early journalistic reports described the bike as having a front end [...] "head shake" [...] or speed wobble, and deliveries of the motorcycle were halted while BMW revised the front end geometry.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sourcing}} of suitable engine, gearbox and final-drive components {{was considered}} {{critical to the}} success of delivering a low-cost mid-engined vehicle. Chapman was keen to diversify beyond the Ford components heavily used in earlier Lotus vehicles, and settled on using the engine and combined transmission/final-drive transaxle units recently released by Renault for their Renault 16. The 1470cc Renault engine was a light and modern design (if somewhat pedestrian in the Renault), while the matching Renault 16 transaxle seemed almost ideal for the Europa project. In the Renault vehicle, the transaxle sat ahead of the engine, driving the front wheels. By relocating the combined engine/transaxle unit to the rear of the car and rotating it 180 degrees in plan, Lotus could obtain a ready-made modern mid-engine configuration - albeit one with 4 reverse gears! By repositioning the differential crownwheel within the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> the direction of rotation of the output shafts was reversed, thus correcting this [...] "shortcoming".|$|E
5000|$|The drive {{package on}} the Royal Star Venture {{includes}} a liquid-cooled [...] (referred to as 1,300 cc) V4 engine fed by four carburettors - one per cylinder - primed by a manually operated push-pull choke. It has four valves per cylinder, overhead camshafts, and shim-over bucket valves. Bore x stroke is 79 x 66 mm (3.11 x 2.60 in) with a compression ratio of 10:1. The five-speed, overdrive transmission {{is part of}} the engine case and the engine and transmission share the same oil. The drive shaft and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> are built into {{the left side of the}} double-sided swing arm.

The rear brake pedal on the opposite (right) side also sits above a spring-loaded, hinged foot board. There are foot boards fitted for the pillion passenger that are also hinged but not spring-loaded, so they can be upright when not in use or dropped to the horizontal position for riding.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to determine a passenger vehicles' acceleration and top speed change {{in response to the}} change in the ratio of the final drive gearing coefficient. To accomplish this, the following tasks had to be completed: analysis of the transmission types, their construction and the operation of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> performing a numerical analysis and comparing it to dynamic real world test results using a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” as the test subject. The car chosen for {{this research}} is a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” due to its classical arrangement comprised of a front mounted four cylinder petrol engine and rear wheel drive. The analysis of the final drive gearing in such arrangement is easier, due to the transmission being separate from the rear mounted differential assembly. By changing the differential housings which have different internal gearing, their effect on the vehicle's acceleration and top speed could be observed and compared to the calculations of expected values. The research was started by gathering and analyzing material about the power delivery chain in the manual transmission vehicle model to develop a familiarity with the components: flywheel, clutch, transmission and integrated subframe <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly.</b> In regards to the available final drive assemblies, four differential housings were chosen with the following internal gearing configurations to conduct this study: 2. 79 : 1 – the lowest one, available from the factory in the diesel powered vehicles known for their high torque. 3. 15 : 1 – the gear set mostly found in the high powered petrol engine cars. 3. 45 : 1 – the gear set that came standard with the chosen test vehicle. 4. 10 : 1 – the gear set used for the least powerful petrol engines, usually coupled with automatic transmissions. Changing the differential therefore changes the gearing of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> and provides a change in vehicle dynamics. After conducting the gathering and analysis of the available information from the data-sheets and literal documentation, practical tests were conducted using a “DL 1 ” data collection tool to capture the information about the response of the car with all four aforementioned differentials. Using the “Analysis V 8 ” software with the said tool, the top speed and acceleration for each gear and all four differentials were determined, alongside the engine RPM for 50 km/h and 90 km/h for different gears. Finally the theoretical calculations for the top speed at max engine in every gear were calculated. They were correlated with the observed values for our measurements, including the top RPM for each gear and the engine RPM for 50 km/h in 3 'rd gear, 50 km/h and 90 km/h in 4 th gear, 90 km/h in 5 th gear. The observations conclude that increasing the ratio of the gear set in the differential leads to a quicker accelerating vehicle, but it negatively affects the comfort and fuel consumption. The best gear set ratio for fuel economy and acceleration for our test vehicle was determined to be the factory 3. 45 : 1 although with increased driving speed (above 90 km/h) fuel economy and comfort are reduced. For users who spend most of their commute at highway speeds, it would be recommended to switch their <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> to the one with the ratio of 2. 79 : 1 for increased comfort and decreased fuel consumption. The conducted research is unique in terms of applicability. A user could tailor their car to their needs in regard to the expected driving conditions based on this research. Also- the calculated and observed data have a very close correlation, therefore a calculated final drive ratio selection could be trusted to have the expected result on the vehicle...|$|E

The test results indicate that the solar arrays can be deployed smoothly, and the deployment velocities are restricted by the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> as expected. During the tests, the RHDA output speed and output torque are obtained. In order to examine the impact force when the yoke is lock-up with a hard stop, dynamics simulations are performed according to the actual behavior.
