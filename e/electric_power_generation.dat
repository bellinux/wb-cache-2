5|$|In Australia, {{the state}} of South Australia generates around half of the nation's wind power capacity. By the end of 2011 wind power in South Australia, championed by Premier (and Climate Change Minister) Mike Rann, reached 26% of the State's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation,</b> edging out coal for the first time. At this stage South Australia, with only 7.2% of Australia's population, had 54% of Australia's {{installed}} capacity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E

5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, two major issues surfaced. First, Waterfield favored {{a tax on}} parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it. Second, Waterfield {{supported}} the development of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> through public utilities, while Clements favored private development (which won him {{the support of the}} Kentucky Utilities company). The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained the endorsement of John Y. Brown, Sr., garnering added support from organized labor. Ultimately, Clements defeated Waterfield by over 30,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale {{wind power}} is the name given to wind {{generation}} systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines {{have been used for}} household <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Rapids - Muskegon Power Company (a {{predecessor}} to today's Consumers Energy Company) {{built the}} Croton Hydroelectric Plant in 1906 - 1907. The plant and its 110,000-volt transmission line (the highest voltage in use at that time) attracted international attention. Curious spectators rode excursion trains to the site, were {{they received a}} tour of the dam and powerhouse, as well as a grand dinner. When the plant went into full service in September 1907 it represented the latest advances in <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> and transmission. Engineers from Russia, England, France, Italy, Japan, and India came to tour the plant when it opened. The facility is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
30|$|It can {{be noticed}} {{that there are two}} {{available}} solutions when it comes to low-carbon development in <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generations.</b> One is to control the CO 2 emission in the existing fossil-fueled plant, while the other one is to seek for alternative clean power sources. Therefore, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technique is applied to absorb and seal the CO 2 produced by power plants while the renewable energy sources including wind and solar power are rapidly exploited throughout the world.|$|R

5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E

40|$|Strong electron-correlations shed {{lights on}} {{improvements}} for conventional thermoelectric {{materials used in}} <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>generations</b> from temperature gradients and solid-state refrigeration. Here, we report remarkable thermoelectric power factors achieved in micrometer-thick SrNbxTi 1 -xO 3 films with strong electron correlations when coupling the carriers with strain-induced lattice-polarons. SrNbxTi 1 -xO 3 films with effectively preserved lattice distortions exhibit orbital anisotropy from the cross-plane charge ordering, as demonstrated by polarization dependent near edge X-ray absorption fine structures. The coulomb-correlations between the lattice-polarons and electron-carriers improve the change of system entropy during carrier transportations and significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient. The achieved maximum thermoelectric power factor of 2, 642 uWcm- 1 K- 2 for micrometer-thick SrNb 0. 2 Ti 0. 8 O 3 films exceeds the ones reported, while their zT values are even larger than the best thermoelectric materials reported for low-temperature usages.
