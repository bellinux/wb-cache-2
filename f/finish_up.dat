5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

Initially unsure of how to release so many songs, the band announced in May 2006 that they would release a one-disc album in early September entitled Barenaked Ladies Are Me. Several alternate versions are available, including downloadable versions and a USB flash drive version. The B.L.A.M. tour in support of the album, and its follow-up Barenaked Ladies Are Men (both of which hail from the same sessions), ran in Fall 2006 for the U.S., February 2007 for Canada, and later in 2007 for the UK. That same year, the band wrote and recorded the theme song for the television series The Big Bang Theory.|$|E
25|$|After {{significant}} {{struggles in}} her early professional career, Infeld made an astonishing comeback in 2015. She set personal records in 2015, running her first race {{of the year in}} 31:38.71 for the 10,000 meters in May and 15:07.19 for the 5000m in June surpassing both the qualifying standards outlined in 2015 World Championships in Athletics_qualification_standards and Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Qualification. Further progressing in 2015, she placed third in the 10,000m at the 2015 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, her highest ever national <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> to that date, gaining selection for the national team alongside Molly Huddle and fellow Bowerman Track Club athlete Shalane Flanagan. At the 2015 Beijing World Championships on Aug 24, 2015, Emily kicked hard for the bronze medal in the 10,000 m, catching a slowing Huddle at the line. All three USA team members (Infeld, Huddle, and Flanagan), were within seconds of one another. The heat and humidity were factors affecting the evolution of the race, slowing the pace of most or all competitors.|$|E

25|$|Less Than {{a minute}} {{into the game}} Brady Quinn proved just why he's {{one of the top}} QBs in College Football today and he didn't stop there going 14 of 19 for 207 yards passing and 4 TDs. At :54 seconds Quinn hit Jeff Samardzija for a 51-yd TD pass and a 7-0 lead. Less than five minutes later he threw a 1-yd pass to John Carlson to put Notre Dame up 14-0. At 8:40 into the game Air Force got on the board when Zach Sasser kicked a 32-yd field goal to shrink the deficit to 14-3. But Quinn would respond with a 24-yd pass to Rhema McKnight. Air Force was able to block the Extra Point Attempt and Notre Dame was now up 20-3 to <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the 1st quarter. The second quarter showed off a lot of good defense {{including}} a blocked FG attempt that saw Terrail Lambert return the blocked kick 76-yds for a TD to put Notre Dame up 27-3 at the half.|$|E
25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and knelt down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber <b>finish</b> <b>up,</b> shaving all of Namajague's hair off while still sitting {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 10, {{the third}} spacewalk of the STS-134 mission was conducted. The spacewalk {{made use of}} a new spacewalk pre-breathe {{protocol}}, called In-Suit Light Exercise (ISLE), instead of the normal campout pre-breathe protocol. The new pre-breathe protocol had the astronauts breathe pure oxygen for 60 minutes in the airlock, which had its air pressure lowered to 10.2 Psi (703hPa). The astronauts then put their spacesuits on, performed light exercise and rested for an additional 50 minutes, breathing pure oxygen all the while. After astronauts Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke exited the Quest Airlock, the pair began installing the Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The fixture itself {{and most of its}} components were installed, but the data cable associated with it was to be installed later. The spacewalking pair then moved on and routed some new power cables from the Unity module to the Zarya module on the Russian segment of the ISS, providing a redundant power supply to the Russian segment. Feustel and Fincke then moved on to <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the installation of the wireless video system which Fuestel and Greg Chamitoff had begun to install on EVA 1. The pair also took pictures of the Zarya module's thrusters and captured some infrared video of an experiment delivered on board the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3. Commander Mark Kelly documented the spacewalk from inside the station. While the EVA was going on, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist Roberto Vittori assisted Expedition 28 flight engineer Ron Garan in stowing new equipment and supplies on the ISS.|$|E

500|$|Since {{her first}} visit to Gwaeynynog {{fourteen}} years before the composition of The Flopsy Bunnies, Potter had sketched the garden many times. She described it following a visit in 1895: [...] "The garden is very large, two-thirds surrounded by a red brick wall with many apricots, and an inner circle of old grey apple trees on espaliers. It is very productive but not tidy, the prettiest kind of garden, where bright old-fashioned flowers grow amongst the currant bushes." [...] Early in 1909 she wrote to her publisher, [...] "I have done lots of sketches [...] not all to the purpose [...] and will now endeavour to <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the F.

500|$|Goldman also {{approached}} Sorkin {{with a story}} premise, which Sorkin {{developed into}} the script for Malice. Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, {{he had to leave}} the project to <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the script for A Few Good Men, so screenwriter Scott Frank stepped in and wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay. When production on A Few Good Men wrapped up, Sorkin took over and resumed working on the Malice right through the final shooting script. Harold Becker directed the film, a medical thriller released in 1993, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. Malice had mixed reviews. Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as [...] "deviously entertaining from its start through its finish". Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having [...] "suspense but no staying power".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Ten were completed in May 1991. Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehabilitation.

I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special," [...] and added, [...] "They had to let me go. I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn't get it together." [...] In June, the band joined Tim Palmer in England for mixing. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was [...] "about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get." [...] Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the guitar solo on [...] "Alive" [...] and tweaking the intro to [...] "Black".

500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1993's Vs., the band members did not go into the {{recording}} sessions with any completed songs, only guitar riffs.

Ament described it as a [...] "real collaborative effort," [...] and Vedder described it as [...] "absolute democracy." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band members were feeling [...] "fresh and energetic" [...] and [...] "were communicating better than ever." [...] Toward the end of the sessions it came down to Vedder to <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the material, with Ament observing that [...] "the way the record started and the way that it finished is probably two different things." [...] Regarding his lyric writing process, Vedder said that he wrote at least four different sets of lyrics for each song, with many going as high as eight. Vedder described as a process that demands [...] "the patience of like a National Geographic photographer sitting underneath the bush in a tent", adding he would at times [...] "figure out after eight, nine or eleven drafts that the first one was actually the one". A total of 25 songs were written before coming down to the 13 on the final track listing. Outtakes include [...] "The Forest", later featured on Ament's 2008 solo album Tone, and [...] "Of the Earth", which started being played live in 2010.|$|E

It has been estimated more than half the Ottoman dismounted troops in Beersheba, were captured or killed, while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured. The 12th Light Horse Regiment handed over 37 officers and 63 other ranks prisoners to Brigade Headquarters at 23:00 with four guns and transport. Together the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments captured 1,148 prisoners, 10 field guns, four machine guns, a huge quantity of military stores, an aerodrome, and railway rolling stock. Total captures by Desert Mounted Corps for the day amounted to 1,528 prisoners. All available engineer units were sent to develop the wells in the town but the supply was not great. Fortunately on 25 October there had been thunderstorms which left pools of water over a wide area from which the horses were watered.|$|E
