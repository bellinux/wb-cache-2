There are several reasons for this. Not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find records from which to construct the subjective side of working-class lives, (this is presumably the case everywhere), but theserecords, even when they do exist, speak in the numerous languages of our ethnically fragmented population. The precondition to access to some of them requires a kind of double identity, an ability to be on intimate terms with some [...] "other" [...] Canadian experience, {{and at the same time}} the capability of communicating that experience to the mainstream culture. An additional problem, of course, is the highly selective nature of any such records. For obviously it is not some homogeneous working class, but certain self-conscious and articulate minorities who are likely to leave a record of any kind.|$|E

If research capability is based on idiosyncratic search routines or tacit knowledge, not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> transfer capability across firm boundaries but also the identification and nurturing of capabilities within firms are problematic. Earlier research suggests that research organizations need processes both for exploitation of existing as well as exploration of emerging research capabilities.

We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to study interference between simple auditory and visual decisions, independently of motor competition. Overlapping activity for auditory and visual tasks performed in isolation was found in lateral prefrontal regions, middle temporal cortex and parietal cortex. When the visual stimulus occurred during the processing of the tone, its activation in prefrontal and middle temporal cortex was suppressed. Additionally, reduced activity was seen in modality-specific visual cortex. These results paralleled impaired awareness of the visual event. Even without competing motor responses, a simple auditory decision interferes with visual processing on different neural levels, including prefrontal cortex, middle temporal cortex and visual regions...|$|E

The UML/Analyzer tool identifies inconsistencies instantly with design changes and it keeps track of all inconsistencies over time. It does not require consistency rules with special annotations.

40|$|Like {{national}} politicians, local {{representatives are}} claimed to become increasingly professionalised.

This article seeks to contribute to the debate by outlining the extent of, and relation between, layman politics and professionalisation in the recruitment and career of Belgian local councillors. After scrutinising these elements separately in a descriptive section, both are linked in a subsequent explanatory analysis, verifying whether professionalised recruitment in a given political system results in professionalised careers.

What is this "IP protection problem" and why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> solve? In this paper we attempt {{to answer these questions}} in terms of various threat models. We then describe various technological approaches to solving the IP protection problem in the context of our threat models. We approach this by first describing solutions from a systems perspective. We then focus on the components of such systems. Particular attention is paid to a steganographic mechanism most commonly known as digital watermarking or fingerprinting and to its role in IP protection systems. Watermarking has gained rather abundant attention of late and is seen by some as a panacea. We analyze how watermarking may be used and then focus on specific mechanisms for audio and video. 1 Introduction Adequate {{protection of}} digital copies of multimedia content - both audio a [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Almost {{all major}} causes of ill-health and {{premature}} death in human societies worldwide – including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many infectious diseases – are, {{at least in}} part, genetically determined. Typically, risk of succumbing {{to one of these}} illnesses is thought to depend on both the individual repertoire of variation within a number of key susceptibility genes and the history of exposure to relevant environmental factors. For many of these conditions, the molecular basis of disease pathogenesis remains obscure. This represents a major obstacle to development of improved, rational strategies for disease treatment, prevention and eradication. It is easy therefore to appreciate the importance attached to efforts to deliver more comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of disease pathogenesis. Nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> understand that identification of major susceptibility genes should highlight those components of molecular machinery that are critical for the preservation of normal health. The benefits promised are great, but progress to gene identification in multifactorial traits has been rather disappointing to date. Why is this? This review aims to answer this question by describing current and future approaches to gene discovery in multifactorial traits. The examples quoted will mostly relate to type 2 diabetes, but the issues and approaches are generic, and apply equally to other multifactorial trait...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} elderly buildings, {{particularly}} those constructed during the million program, {{in need of}} renovations and plumbing replacement. An alternative to the traditional plumbing replacement is the relatively new and untested technique called relining. The {{purpose of the study}} is to thoroughly investigate the different types of relining that are currently available on the market to help enhance Peab’s knowledge before purchasing relining services. The theoretical part of this report is based on relevant information provided from companies, previous studies, investigations and reports within the area. A number of interviews with persons somehow connected to the relining business have also been done. The result is based on the made investigations and experiences various people have from working with relining. It is clear from the study that relining is a good technique if it is used and performed in a correct way and a big responsibility is placed {{in the hands of the}} person performing it. There are risks with relining and there are many cases that show a bad end product after relining. Furthermore <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> say whether is a good or bad alternative, since there are both good and bad results from using the technique. What can be said is that relining is a good complement to plumbing replacement and if companies based in the relining business may enter the negotiations in an early stage, the risk of problems may decrease considerabl...|$|E
