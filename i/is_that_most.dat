5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> mutations are harmful.

5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} {{that can be}} made, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Americans will marry {{at least once in}} their lifetime with the first marriage most commonly ending in divorce. Today a little over half (52.3%) of US household include a married couple, showing a significant decrease since 1970 when 70.6% of households included a married couple. Current trends indicate that people in the US are marrying later and less often with higher divorce rates.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. One reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically {{be found in the}} ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E

50|$|Historically the Indian {{peoples of}} the North American {{continent}} rarely joined forces across tribal lines, which were divisions related to distinct language and cultural groups.

5|$|The plan of Salisbury Cathedral <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories {{for the purpose}} of comparing English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on paper at least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of Salisbury. Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of the}} nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. Salisbury Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to the top of its massive spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much more representative of the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of Salisbury.|$|E
