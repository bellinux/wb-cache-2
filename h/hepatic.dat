5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and <b>hepatic</b> conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from <b>hepatic</b> amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to <b>hepatic</b> amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma {{can affect}} any {{area of the}} bile ducts, either within or outside the liver. Tumors {{occurring}} in the bile ducts within the liver {{are referred to as}} intrahepatic, those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right <b>hepatic</b> ducts meet to form the common <b>hepatic</b> duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.|$|E

5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} <b>hepatic</b> encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal <b>hepatic</b> encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once <b>hepatic</b> encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of <b>hepatic</b> {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult}} to detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of <b>hepatic</b> encephalopathy is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of <b>hepatic</b> encephalopathy is graded with the West Haven Criteria; this {{is based on}} the level of impairment of autonomy, changes in consciousness, intellectual function, behavior, and the dependence on therapy.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>hepatic</b> encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. <b>Hepatic</b> encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hepatic</b> {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{an altered}} level of consciousness {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages it can result in a coma.|$|E

5|$|Like modern crocodilians, pterosaurs {{appeared}} {{to have had a}} <b>hepatic</b> piston, seeing as their shoulder-pectoral girdles were too inflexible to move the sternum as in birds, and they possessed strong gastralia.

5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers <b>hepatic</b> cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating <b>hepatic</b> gene expression.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} epiphytic bryophytes within a tree was {{conducted}} in lower montane rainforest at 2400 m in the Peruvian Yungas. The Weinmannia sp. host tree supported 110 species (77 <b>hepatics,</b> one hornwort and 32 mosses). To our knowledge, this is the highest single-tree bryophyte species richness reported to date. We used Johansson zones (lower trunk, upper trunk, mid-crown, mid-outer crown and outer crown) to stratify our sampling {{and found that the}} greatest species richness and abundance was on the upper trunk and large branches of the mid-crown. <b>Hepatics,</b> and the Lejeuneaceae in particular, were dominant in all five Johansson zones of the tree. The mid-crown had higher radiation intensity than the dark lower trunk while still having high relative humidity. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated the presence of four communities: an outer crown, a mid to mid-outer crown, an upper trunk and a lower trunk community. The outer crown supported only two moss species along with 35 <b>hepatics,</b> which included 17 high-light tolerant <b>hepatics.</b> The climate data suggested that this pattern was due to higher irradiation and exposure. More bryological work is needed in these poorly catalogued montane forests of the Peruvian Andes, which are under multiple threats that include forest clearing and climate change...|$|R

5000|$|The Marchantiophyta [...] are a {{division}} of non-vascular land plants {{commonly referred to as}} <b>hepatics</b> or liverworts. Like mosses and hornworts, they have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hepatics.</b> The {{second class}} {{into which the}} Bryophyta are divided is a purely natural one. There are no {{intermediate}} forms through which the two groups are connected, though their close relationship is very apparent. There is always a natural distinction, requiring no arbitrary line to separate them. The gametophyte is varied in structure; many have {{the form of a}} flat, green plate, while the greater number develop leaves; yet when leaves are present these have a distinction of insertion and structure quite different from those of Mosses. Leaves are always placed in two or three rows, two lateral and one ventral, the latter row occasionally being absent. They are usually of delicate consistence, never have a midrib, and are often divided. Most <b>Hepatics</b> live only under permanently moist conditions, but some few can survive even the drying conditions of bare rock at a high elevation. The characteristic feature of <b>Hepatics</b> is that while they have the typical antheridia, archegonia and permanently attached sporophyte of the class, the sporophyte has attained a much further reduction than amongst Mosses. It is no longer a hard-tissued, persistent being, but is reduced to a comparatively evanescent organ. In most it is a simple globular or oblong dark capsule, which splits into four valves at maturity, borne on a long or short pellucid stalk. In Marchantia and its allies the stalk is almost absent. In Riccia. reduction has reached its limit, and the sporophyte is reduced to a spherical spore sack, buried in the substance of its parent. One order of <b>Hepatics,</b> of which Anthoceros is the type, has a sporophyte of less reduced character than the rest, but still of a form {{not to be confused with}} that of a true moss; the shape is long and slender, and it splits from top to base into two valves. It is green, and still bears efficient stomata on its surface. <b>Hepatics</b> may be sorted into three perfectly natural Orders :— Marchantiales, Jungermanniales, Anthocerotales. This article describes the genera, including locations they are found. An index of genera is given at the end...|$|R
40|$|The {{bryophyte}} vegetation in twenty-eight hectare plots in {{forests of}} S-Chile between 38 ° and 42 °S and sea {{level and the}} forest line has been studied. Since bryophytes are fully dependend on atmospheric water and nutrient supply, they are good indicators of ecological conditions, especially for humidity. Therefore cover of epiphytic bryophytes, percentage of <b>hepatics,</b> composition of life forms and phytomass of epiphytic bryophytes were used as parameters. Cover and phytomass of epiphytic bryophytes as well as percentage of <b>hepatics</b> show moderate values in the lowlands, peak values in the montane belt (400 - 800 m) and low values in the high montane to subalpine forests. This zonation corresponds with the composition of life forms and is attributed to a higher humidity in the montane belt. Life forms characteristic for the lowlands and submontane belts are pendants, those for the montane belt are wefts and tails, and those for the high montane and and subalpine belts are mats and cushions. The same zonation is found in New Zealand at comparable latitudes. The altitudinal differences are much stronger than the latitudinal ones. Compared with similar transect studies in New Zealand, there is a comparable zonation based on bryphytes. The percentage of <b>hepatics</b> as a good indicator of humidity, is – both in Chile and New Zealand - higher in the transects along the coast with higher precipitation, lower in transects in the inland with less precipitation, and increasing with altitude. Compared with tropical rain forests, the “mossiness” of temperate rain forests expressed by phytomass of epiphytic bryophytes per hectare, cover and percentage of <b>hepatics</b> is comparable to tropical rain forests above 2000 m, which is the corresponding elevation {{with regard to the}} mean annual precipitation. In Chile, however, there is a distinct decrease of “mossiness” in the high montane and subalpine forests, which is attributed to special climatological conditions, whereas bryophytes reach maximum cover and phytomass in the tropical high montane and subalpine forests. A comparison with montane forests in Europe in 48 °N reveal, that phytomass and percentage of <b>hepatics</b> is distinctly less than in the true rain forests of the southern hemisphere...|$|R
