5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E

The man tells the woman that the person she is seeking is only one day's ride away. She leaves him a canteen of water. Meanwhile, the bearded man's lost horse is found by Coley. He mounts the horse, and rides back to the group. <b>He</b> <b>charges</b> Spear. Spear shoots him dead. Gashade buries his friend in the sand.|$|E
25|$|During the feast, Mrs. Karvel asks Jaynes {{to bring}} out more dessert, and Sausage Nose and a child follow him inside the Biodome. The child dies in a river from the rat poison, and Sausage Nose realizes the trick that is being played on the Snow Honkies. <b>He</b> <b>charges</b> at Jaynes and is killed by an ax to the head, {{courtesy}} of Garth. To avoid suspicions of Sausage Nose going missing, Jaynes forces Garth into a robe and smears toothpaste {{on his face and}} hands. The Snow Honkies discover that something is amiss and that Garth is not Sausage Nose at all. The Snow Honkies begin to attack the humans when an earthquake occurs, killing all except Jaynes, Garth, and Pym.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the fourth letter is devoted to an argument revolving around the political liberty of the Irish people. It is for this argument that the Drapier was persecuted, because his words were seen as a call to challenge British authority and possibly to declare independence from the king. The Drapier walks {{a fine line between}} loyalty and disloyalty, because <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> that the Irish are loyal only to their king, who had the title [...] "King of Ireland", but not to England.

500|$|Later in his career, Federer {{added the}} drop shot to his arsenal and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He {{sometimes}} uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially {{referred to as}} a [...] "tweener" [...] or [...] "hotdog". His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the 2009 US Open against Novak Djokovic, bringing him triple match point. Federer {{is one of the top}} players who employs successfully the [...] "squash shot", when he gets pushed deep and wide on his forehand wing. Since Stefan Edberg joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season, Federer has played a more offensive game, attacking the net more often, and improved his volley shots. In the lead-up to the 2015 US Open, Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger), in which <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> his opponent while receiving the serve and hits a return on the run.|$|E
500|$|Grant later {{expressed}} {{relief that}} he had not fully committed to portraying Anarky as a potential murderer, as he felt [...] "Anarky would have compromised his own beliefs if he had taken the route of the criminal-killer." [...] Anarky was given a non-lethal approach in The Batman Adventures No.31, [...] "Anarky", written by Alan Grant, who acted as a guest author for the issue. Anarky takes business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a pirate television show. [...] <b>He</b> <b>charges</b> these men with such crimes as the creation of land mines that kill or cripple thousands, funding Third World dictators, polluting the air with toxic chemicals, and profiting from wage slavery, and threatens each man with a bomb if the public should find them guilty. When the explosions take place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness. One bomb explosion carried a specific message. It unfurled a banner that denounced lethal weapons.|$|E

500|$|A young Cambridge University professor, Horace Holly, is {{visited by}} a colleague, Vincey, who reveals {{that he will}} soon die. Vincey {{proceeds}} to tell Holly a fantastical tale of his family heritage. <b>He</b> <b>charges</b> Holly {{with the task of}} raising his young son, Leo (whom he has never seen) and gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo turns 25. Holly agrees, and indeed Vincey is found dead the next day. Holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on Leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious [...] "Sherd of Amenartas", which seems to corroborate Leo's father's story. Holly, Leo and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa but are shipwrecked. They alone survive, together with their Arab captain, Mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the African interior, they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshipped as Hiya or [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed". The Amahagger are curious about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen.|$|E
500|$|In Venezuela, {{debate about}} The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is [...] "often acrimonious". The film has become key to framing people's {{understanding}} {{of the events of}} April 2002. The previously accepted international view was that Chávez's ousting came from a [...] "spontaneous popular response" [...] to the repression of his regime; the film [...] "directly contradicts" [...] this position, and since its release it has rapidly become [...] "the prevailing interpretation of [...] ". The film's critics charge that it omits or misrepresents important events. Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers' [...] "use of stock [...] devices", such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident. Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time, when some of the footage was captured on different days. Bartley and ÓBriain justify these methods as standard practice in the construction of documentary realist films. Caracas-based journalist Phil Gunson, writing in Columbia Journalism Review, says that most of the film critics who embraced the film ignored [...] "the complex, messy reality" [...] of the situation. <b>He</b> <b>charges</b> that the filmmakers [...] "omit key facts, invent others, twist the sequence of events to support their case, and replace inconvenient images with others dredged from archives". Bartley and ÓBriain argue that Gunson's points are [...] "issues of dispute" [...] that [...] "continue to divide opinion" [...] in Venezuela. Author Brian A. Nelson says that Bartley and ÓBriain—in their initial meeting with Chávez—did more than merely invoke the Irish general Daniel O'Leary to gain the president's support for filming; Nelson alleges that they offered to portray the president positively in return for open access, with a [...] "you scratch my back if I scratch yours" [...] understanding that he says was ultimately reflected in the film's [...] "unabashed pro-Chavismo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early Christianity scholar R. Joseph Hoffmann, {{chair of}} the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public {{to the fact that}} there are no secure {{conclusions}} when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> that the film [...] "is all about bad assumptions," [...] beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it [...] "amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} brought to St. Louis, Missouri in late June 1904 without Verner, who had been taken ill with malaria. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun, and the Africans {{immediately}} {{became the center of}} attention. Ota Benga was particularly popular, and his name was reported variously by the press as Artiba, Autobank, Ota Bang, and Otabenga. He had an amiable personality, and visitors were eager to see his teeth, which had been filed to sharp points in his early youth as ritual decoration. The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances. One newspaper account, promoting Ota Benga as [...] "the only genuine African cannibal in America", claimed [...] " [...] worth the five cents <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> for showing them to visitors".|$|E
2500|$|James Kirchick, {{writing in}} The New Republic, called J Street's {{labeling}} of AIPAC as [...] "right wing" [...] "ridiculous"; Kirchick says that AIPAC's former president {{told him that}} AIPAC was the first American Jewish organization to support Oslo and supports a two-state solution. Kirchick further asserts that some of J Street's positions, such as advocating negotiations with Hamas, are not popular with most American Jews. According to a March 2008 Haaretz-Dialog poll the majority of Israelis do support direct talks with Hamas, although this referred solely {{to the issue of}} kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Jeremy Ben-Ami responded to Kirchick's charges during a May 26, 2008, interview published in Haaretz Magazine. Kirchick also reacted against J Streets endorsement of the play Seven Jewish Children, which many critics consider antisemitic. [...] "To J Street, the inflammatory message of Seven Jewish Children is precisely what makes it worthy of production," [...] <b>he</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, Rand {{publicly}} {{broke with}} Nathaniel and Barbara Branden. She accused Nathaniel Branden of a [...] "gradual {{departure from the}} principles of Objectivism," [...] financial exploitation of her related to business loans, and [...] "deliberate deception of several persons." [...] In a response sent to the mailing list of The Objectivist in 1968, the Brandens denied many of Rand's charges against them. The result of their conflicting claims was a [...] "schism", as some participants in the Objectivist movement supported the Brandens, while others supported Rand's repudiation of them. Robert L. Bradley, Jr. has called the dissolution of NBI an [...] "organizational failure" [...] in the Objectivist movement [...] "as stunning as the collapse of Enron in a different context"; <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> Rand with [...] "resorting to half-truths" [...] and concludes that she [...] "would never own up to the circumstances leading to the split, personally or publicly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barnes's verse play The Antiphon (1958) {{is set in}} England in 1939. Jeremy Hobbs, in {{disguise}} as Jack Blow, has brought his family together at their ruined ancestral home, Burley Hall. His motive is never explicitly stated, {{but he seems to}} want to provoke a confrontation among the members of his family and force them to confront the truth about their past. His sister Miranda is a stage actress, now [...] "out of patron and of money"; her materialistic brothers, Elisha and Dudley, see her as a threat to their financial well-being. Elisha and Dudley accuse their mother Augusta of complicity with their abusive father Titus Hobbs. They take advantage of Jeremy's absence to don animal masks and assault both women, making cruel and sexually suggestive remarks; Augusta treats this attack as a game. Jeremy returns with a doll house, a miniature version of the house in America where the children grew up. As she examines it, <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> her with making herself [...] "a madam by submission," [...] since she failed to prevent Titus from orchestrating Miranda's rape by [...] "a travelling Cockney thrice [...] age." [...] The last act finds Miranda and Augusta alone together. Augusta, at once disapproving and envious of her daughter's more liberated life, exchanges clothes with her daughter and wants to pretend she is young again, but Miranda refuses to enter into this play. When Augusta hears Elisha and Dudley driving away, she blames Miranda for their abandonment and beats her to death with a curfew bell, falling dead at her side from the exertion.|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{has also}} been {{consistently}} critical of unchecked and unmonitored illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico and the Central American republics, which he sees as threatening to overwhelm the United States with millions of Spanish-speakers who make assimilation difficult and some of whom <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> have criminal records and do not establish a record of work history. In a 2014 column [...] "1984 Redux: Orwellian Illegal Immigration" [...] Hanson wrote that Hispanic groups that use the name La Raza are racialists who have [...] "hijacked" [...] America's immigration policy to permit non-diverse, illegal, and unrestricted illegal immigration into the United States to further demographically-based political agendas, and who have made often false claims of suffering continual racial prejudice from a supposed prejudiced white majority, while arguing that Latinos as members of La Raza should keep themselves separate {{from the rest of}} Americans. Hanson has condemned groups such as the National Council of La Raza as he argued that term La Raza has an unfortunate history as a [...] "racialist term," [...] whose origins he claims go back to fascist Spain of General Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy, and those Mexican-American leaders who self-identify with the Francoist term La Raza are themselves guilty of operating as racial separatists. In this regard, Hanson has voiced qualified support for Donald Trump's plans to deport illegal immigrants from the United States, after offering a chance for green card residence to those who were vetted and found to have no criminal record, no history of public support, and residence of some duration. Blanket deportation policy, Hanson argued, would be as [...] "unworkable", as is the present open-borders status quo.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{video games}} and books depict Fett's work as a bounty hunter, for which <b>he</b> <b>charges</b> [...] "famously expensive" [...] fees and that he {{undertakes}} only when the mission meets [...] "his harsh sense of justice." [...] K. W. Jeter's Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy (1998–1999) depicts Fett as more communicative than in the films because the books' plots require Fett to show [...] "an ability to convince {{people as well as}} kill them." [...] Works such as Dark Horse Comics' Dark Empire series (1991–1992) describe Fett escaping from the Sarlacc. In another trilogy, after it describes him nearly killing the Sarlacc, it goes into detail about how Dengar, one of the bounty hunters hired to find Solo in The Empire Strikes Back, and featured in the series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, finds him and restores him back to health. He would have occasional run-ins with Han Solo and his family over the years, before fighting against the Yuuzhan Vong and becoming the leader of the Mandalorians. In the Legacy of the Force series (2006–2008), Jaina Solo asks Fett to train her to help her defeat her corrupted brother and ends up helping fight against Jacen's troops. Such media also reveal that Fett became a family man at one point, though he was forcibly separated from his wife after killing his commanding officer for assaulting her. His wife subsequently disappeared and was presumed dead, and their daughter blamed Boba for her fate, and began hunting him. Her own daughter, Mirta Gev, later sought Boba out and connected with her grandfather, while her mother was killed by Jacen Solo after he became Darth Caedus. Mirta later married a Mandalorian warrior, and Boba's wife was discovered to be alive, having been frozen in carbonite some decades previously.|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] <b>He</b> <b>charges</b> society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction.
