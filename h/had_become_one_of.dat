5|$|By {{the start}} of the 1990s, the music {{industry}} was enticed by alternative rock's commercial possibilities and major labels actively courted bands including Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dinosaur Jr., Firehose, and Nirvana. In particular, R.E.M.'s success had become a blueprint for many alternative bands in the late 1980s and 1990s to follow; the group had outlasted many of its contemporaries and by the 1990s <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most popular bands in the world.|$|E
5|$|Crawford made a {{successful}} transition to talkies. Her first {{starring role in}} an all-talking feature-length film was in Untamed in 1929, co-starring Robert Montgomery.

5|$|Opponents to the {{shut-down}} {{maintained that}} most of the animals were unable to survive in the wild and would perish, and that the zoo's facilities <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred creatures and thereby relate to traditional stories, {{due to the fact that}} most younger Navajos are more accustomed to dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{opened in}} 1794, linking Uxbridge with Birmingham. By 1800 Uxbridge <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{important}} market towns in Middlesex, helped by its status as the first stopping point for stagecoaches travelling from London to Oxford. The development of Uxbridge declined after {{the opening of the}} Great Western Railway in 1838, which passed through West Drayton. A branch line to Uxbridge was not built until 1904.|$|E

William Ewart Gladstone gave evidence in the court against a blackmailer who claimed Gladstone had frequented prostitutes in Leicester Square, while the Marquess of Queensbury's libel trial against Oscar Wilde took place here in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Although Monroe <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had {{not changed}} since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E

He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run The Watch Tower from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's will, drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.|$|E

The Petersons' children also worked in the business, daughter Kathy as a personnel manager and son Keith as a partner in an affiliated electronics import-export business, operating out of Boston.|$|E
5|$|During the Reagan years, Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E
5|$|From 1517, {{during the}} years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was {{subdivided}} into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.|$|E

5|$|Starting on June 6, a major Russian push was {{directed}} against the 40km line between Kołki and Kostiuchnówka, {{with the aim of}} taking the position and then advancing towards Kovel. With Polish legionnaires staying put and holding the ground, more Russian reinforcements were thrown in, while the battle of Kostiuchnówka <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major struggles in the area during World War I. Polish forces launched a counterattack, pushing back the Russians – who had not expected such a bold move – on the night of June 8 and 9.|$|E
5|$|United States {{officials}} had only estimates of its enemy's capabilities; intelligence collection agencies often conflicted with each other.

During the year interdiction of the system <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the top American priorities, but operations against it were complicated by the limited forces {{available at the time}} and Laos's ostensible neutrality.|$|E
