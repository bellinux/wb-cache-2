5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some of these materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a coaxial extending metal mirror reflector attached to the electrode <b>housing</b> <b>or</b> gas cup on a welding torch. An electric welding torch with an internal viewing system for robotic welding is provded with an annular arc light reflector to reflect light from the arc back onto the workpiece. The reflector has a vertical split or gap in its surrounding wall to permit the adjacent wall ends forming the split to be sprung open slightly to permit the reflector to be removed or slipped onto the torch <b>housing</b> <b>or</b> gas cup. The upper opening of the reflector is slightly smaller than the torch <b>housing</b> <b>or</b> gas cup and therefore, when placed on the torch <b>housing</b> <b>or</b> gas cup has that springiness to cause it to clamp tightly on the <b>housing</b> <b>or</b> gas cup. The split or gap also serves to permit the feed of weld wire through to the weld area...|$|R

5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning a <b>house</b> <b>or</b> land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They {{argue that such}} immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, storytelling, children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a <b>house</b> <b>or</b> sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.|$|E

"O you who believe, {{let those}} whom your right hands possess {{and those of}} you who have not {{attained}} to puberty ask permission of you three times: Before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. These are three times of privacy for you; besides these it is no sin for you nor for them -- some of you go round about (waiting) upon others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And when the children among you attain to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And (as for) women past childbearing, who hope not for marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their adornment. And if they are modest, it is better for them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. There is no blame on the blind man, nor any blame on the lame, nor blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat in your own <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your fathers' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your mothers' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your brothers' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your sisters' houses; or your paternal uncles' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your paternal aunts' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your maternal uncles' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> your maternal aunts' <b>houses,</b> <b>or</b> (<b>houses)</b> whereof you possess the keys, <b>or</b> your friends' (<b>houses).</b> It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately.

ArtWalk is organized by Galveston Arts Center, which releases an ArtWalk brochure featuring {{a map of}} participating venues as well as descriptions of shows and exhibits. Venues include GAC, Galveston Artist Residency and artist’s studios and galleries. Additionally, art is shown in “other walls”—for example MOD Coffeehouse or Mosquito Cafe—or outdoors at Art Market on Market Street. Musicians perform outdoors and at venues such as the Proletariat Gallery & Public <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe. While most ArtWalk events are concentrated downtown, {{there are a number}} or participants elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception. As a result, its animals were frequently afflicted by disease, and also {{suffered from the}} harsh easterly winds of the Edinburgh climate. Despite these setbacks, the menagerie attempted to maintain its popularity by putting on concerts, acrobatics shows and displays of fireworks and Montgolfier balloons. Children were carried around the park {{on the back of}} the zoo's elephant, giving it a rare opportunity for exercise. Even with these entertainments, the Zoological Gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat. The park was closed and the site sold to a property developer in 1857. Nothing now remains of the <b>house</b> <b>or</b> its gardens.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont <b>House,</b> <b>or</b> more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E

5|$|Cecil House, {{also called}} Exeter <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Burghley House, {{was built in}} the 16th century by Lord Burghley as an {{expansion}} of an existing Tudor house. Exeter House was demolished in 1676 and Exeter Exchange built on the site. A menagerie was built on the upper floors in 1773, which was later run by Edward Cross, who housed lions, tigers, monkeys and hippopotami. In 1826, an elephant, Chunee, nearly broke free from its cage and had to be destroyed; the skeleton was later put on display. The exchange was demolished in 1829, with the menagerie moving to the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and replaced by Exeter Hall, noted for its Evangelical meetings. This was demolished in 1907, and the site is now occupied by the Strand Palace Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

Local prisoners were also been kept in the Round <b>House,</b> <b>or</b> on Rottnest Island. In 1876 Perth Gaol was transferred back to local control.|$|E
