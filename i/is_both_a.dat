50|$|However, this {{contention}} that {{one and the}} same proposition can <b>be</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> posteriori and necessary is considered absurd by some philosophers (as is Kripke's paired claim that the same proposition can <b>be</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> priori and contingent).|$|R

5|$|Bristol <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> {{city and}} a county, since Edward III granted it a county charter in 1373.

On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon. The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012 film , the Pyramid Head, {{once more}} portrayed by Roberto Campanella, <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from {{the forces of}} Silent Hill. This is {{explained}} by its loyalty to Alessa: since Heather is the good half of Alessa's soul, it sees them as the same being and is thus bound to protect both from harm. Pyramid Head is also seen controlling the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Revolution era, authors {{continued}} to take direct inspiration from Caragiale. In 2008, Ion Iovan published Ultimele însemnări ale lui Mateiu Caragiale ("Mateiu Caragiale's Final Records"), a mock-diary and speculative fiction work covering the final events in Caragiale's life. In addition to covering {{the elements of}} his biography, it invents a character {{by the name of}} Jean Mathieu, Caragiale's secret son. Caragiale's work was also treasured by Romanian-language writers in newly independent Moldova, formerly part of the Soviet Union. One of them, Anatol Moraru, wrote Craii de modă nouă ("A New Fashion of Rakes"), which <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> memoir and a tribute to Craii....|$|E

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|The bridge <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> {{connector}} and a viewing {{platform for}} the park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east.

5|$|The castle is {{opposite}} Wharton's Lock, {{which is}} followed by the village of Tiverton on the north bank. Immediately after a bridge carrying the A49 road over the canal is the first of the two Beeston locks. The first is called Beeston Iron Lock, and was built from cast iron plates in 1828 by Telford. Cast iron was used because of problems with running sand under the original stone locks. It <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> grade II* listed structure and a scheduled ancient monument, and is unique in England. Shortly afterwards is Beeston Stone Lock, also a listed structure, but dating from the construction of the canal and using conventional materials.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on {{location}} at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its earlier use by Hammer Film Productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> parody of and tribute to many of the kitsch science fiction and horror films, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of punk rock fashion trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with {{a diet that}} varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
