25|$|Based {{upon the}} real Ituri Forest in Africa, this exhibit opened in 1999 and houses {{different}} animal species from the rainforests of central Africa. The exhibit {{begins with a}} forested exhibit for okapi then winds past a recreation of two leaf-covered Mbuti huts with signage about the people's customs and traditions. Next, the path leads to the hippopotamus exhibit, which also houses tilapia and has an underwater viewing area. After the hippos, the path passes through a bunch of bamboo before reaching a clearing where aviaries have housed <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco,</b> emerald starlings, tambourine doves, and Congo peafowl. A thatched-roof gift shop and a food stand are located in a plaza near by. Immediately to the right is the African forest buffalo exhibit, which also houses De Brazza's monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Schmidt's spot-nosed guenon, and spotted-necked otters. The plaza leads to a bridge flanked by the buffalo exhibit {{on one side and}} an exhibit that only the small monkeys and otters can access on the other. Across the bridge is a creek where the otters can swim, with viewing both above and below the water's surface. Afterwards, the path joins the rest of the zoo.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> (Corythaeola cristata) is a turaco, a {{group of}} African near-passerines. It is the largest species of turaco. Generally, the <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> is 70 - 76 cm in length with a mass of 800 - 1231 g. [...] In the Bandundu {{province}} of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> is actively hunted for meat and feathers. The blue and yellow tail feathers are prized for making good luck talismans. In the area of Bandundu around the city of Kikwit, it is called [...] "Kolonvo".|$|E
50|$|The last species had {{sometimes}} been united with the Ruwenzori turaco (Ruwenzorornis), and the <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> (Corythaeola cristata) with Gallirex.|$|E
50|$|Walled Garden houses aviaries, {{including}} a Humboldt penguin enclosure and a Tropical House with exotic plants and free-roaming sloths, and tropical birds such as <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turacos,</b> Bali starlings and bleeding heart pigeons. Penguin feeding and talk is held daily at 11 am and 3 pm. Mammals in the Walled Garden include meerkats, yellow mongooses, prairie dogs and a breeding group of Oriental small-clawed otters. There {{is also a}} collection of small primates, including squirrel monkeys, pygmy marmosets, red-handed tamarins and emperor tamarins.|$|R
50|$|The Biaka (Bayaka) and Baka pygmies of the {{northern}} Congo basin relate tales of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé, a legendary, dinosaur-like creature purportedly inhabiting the Lake Tele region of the Republic of the Congo (ROC). It is thought to feed on Landolphia, a type of liana. Other denizens of the ROC include moustached guenons, crowned guenons, red colobus monkeys, okapis and the blue duiker. Figs sustain <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turacos,</b> black mangabeys and various hornbills. The forests of Tanzania’s Gombe National Park support common chimpanzees and the bais of Dzanga-Sangha National Park in the Central African Republic support numbers of forest elephant. Other Congolese inhabitants featured include red river hogs, bongos, forest buffalo, orb-web spiders and colonial spiders. Returning again to the ROC, the Biaka are seen to expertly craft Portuguese-style crossbows and arrows made from seven different kinds of wood and other plants. Gorillas are again viewed at the Odzala National Park.|$|R
25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turacos</b> successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{important}} birds found here include the <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco,</b> mountain buzzard (Buteo oreophilus), white-spotted flufftail (Sarothrura pulchra), grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), bar-tailed trogon (Apaloderma vittatum) and the black-and-white-casqued hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus).|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} famous for its birds, 367 bird species have been {{recorded}} in the forest such as the west African <b>Great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> and black-and-white-casqued hornbill. At least 9 birds are not found anywhere else.|$|E
50|$|The {{penultimate}} episode {{looks at}} the continent’s rainforests, which cover equatorial Africa from Uganda to Sierra Leone. Their extent responds to climatic variations and as this is a wet period in Africa’s history, the forests are near their maximum coverage. In the wet season, killifish hatch, grow and breed in a puddle in an elephant’s footprint and can move across land to find new water sources. Fruiting trees attract birds such as Black-casqued hornbills, <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turacos</b> and African grey parrots. Elephants are filmed breaking open fallen omphalocarpum fruits using their trunks, behaviour only recently discovered by scientists. The fruit eaters also help to disperse seeds. Black-and-white colobus are leaf-eaters, but despite living in the canopy, they are hunted by Biaka pygmies and crowned eagles. The Biakas also harvest yams, climb to bees nests to collect honey and use natural toxins to stun fish in the forest streams. A fast-growing giant yam exploits the gap created by a fallen tree. The yam has several defences against being eaten, including attracting aggressive ants, but a particular beetle has evolved a strategy to combat both yam and ants. Chimpanzees are filmed using sticks to extract termites and safari ants from hollow logs. At a few special places in the forests, large clearings created by elephants attract many animals to socialise, reinforce bonds and feed on the mineral-rich ground. One such clearing is Dzanga Bai in the Central African Republic, visited by 2,800 elephants, shy bongos and western lowland gorillas.|$|R

50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> heron {{is a type}} of {{bird that}} has a yellow beak, black {{shoulders}} and long hair at the back of its grayish black blue head. The head is slightly curved at the neck. The <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> heron is 3.2 to 4.5 feet (1 to 1.4 meters) tall. Its wingspan is 5.5 to 6.6 feet long. This hungry bird eats large insects, gophers, fish, frogs, mice, small mammals, small reptiles, salamanders, crayfish and squirrels plus ducklings. The <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> heron likes to hang out anywhere in Alberta (including Weed Lake) and in the U.S.A (Florida). They communicate with a loud screech or a squawk. They migrate to South America in the fall. The <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> herons' predators are bald eagles and great horned owls. The <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> herons hunt alone and migrate in small flocks.|$|R
50|$|Most turacos are {{medium-sized}} birds - {{an exception}} being the large <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> - with long tails and short, rounded wings. They range in length from 40 to(-) 75 cm. Their flight is weak, {{but they are}} strong climbers {{and are able to}} move nimbly on branches and through vegetation. Juveniles have claws on the wings that help them climb. They have a unique foot arrangement, where the fourth toe can be brought around {{to the back of the}} foot where it almost touches the first toe, or brought around so that it is near the second and third. In spite of this flexibility the toe is actually usually held at right angles to the axis of the foot.|$|E

40|$|Frugivorous forest {{primates}} face {{a continual}} challenge to locate ripe fruit {{due to the}} poor visibility characterizing a heavily vegetated habitat and the spatial and temporal unpredictability of their fruit sources. We present two hypotheses regarding fruit finding in gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena). The first hypothesis is that mangabeys monitor nonfruiting fig trees by visiting and checking them for fruit {{at a higher rate}} than control trees that do not produce preferred fruit. We test this hypothesis by comparing rates of visitation to focal fig trees and control trees. The second hypothesis is that mangabeys use sym-patric frugivore loud calls to locate fruit sources. We test this hypothesis (1) observationally, by comparing the rates at which mangabeys visit calling sites of sympatric frugivores and matched control areas; and (2) experimentally, by following mangabey responses to playbacks of tape-recorded calls: the black-and-white-casqued hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus) long call, the <b>great</b> <b>blue</b> <b>turaco</b> (Corythaeola cristata) rattling kok, the adult male mangabey whoopgobble, and the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) pant hoot.
