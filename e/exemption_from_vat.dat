The work is divided into three parts. The first part is purely theoretical, describes the rules for the taxation of VAT for nonprofit theatres. The second one consists of case studies of selected theatres in 2013 and introduces the VAT in case of such theatre in the role of VAT payer in the main activity. The third part inspects VAT system in the European Union and suggests its potential application in the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{faced by}} {{many developing countries}} in raising revenue from direct taxes have forced them to rely heavily on indirect taxes to finance development interventions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate how to identify socially desirable options for commodity taxation in the context of a poverty reduction strategy. Within the logic of social evaluation the author assesses tax options on the basis of value judgments underlying members of the additively separable class of poverty measures. The criterion hinges on both the pattern of consumption of each commodity and the price elasticity of the poverty measure used. An application of this methodology to data for Guinea shows that many components of food expenditure (particularly cereals, grains and roots) would be good candidates for <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>VAT.</b> Even though expenditure on health and education is distributed in favor of the non-poor, their importance for human capital development argues for a program of targeted subsidies in a broader context of cost recovery...|$|E

40|$|The book {{provides}} a thorough legal {{analysis of the}} treatment of insurance in the harmonized system of European VAT {{as compared to the}} treatment of insurance in the New Zealand and Australian Goods and Services Tax (GST) systems. Insurance constitutes {{a significant part of the}} financial services sector, and it is one of the foundations of a modern society and economy. In the design of tax laws, however, whether and how to tax insurance is a complex issue that has become particularly controversial in the area of VAT. In the EU, as in most of the world, insurance is exempt <b>from</b> <b>VAT,</b> but New Zealand and Australia do not follow this practice. Given that New Zealand’s simple, comprehensive GST – called ‘the world’s purest value-added tax’ (and its modified Australian version) – do not appear to suffer from the shortcomings in efficiency and effectiveness that plague European VAT, a comparison of the two systems is in order. This book is thus the first to draw a comparative in-depth study of the treatment of insurance in the two systems. Among the underlying issues and topics treated by the two systems covered are the following: who has a right to deduct input VAT in relation to supplies inherent in insurance arrangements and to what extent;what constitutes a supply of insurance and consideration for such a supply;what transactions fall within the scope of the VAT Directive’s exemption for insurance; andwhat draws a line between insurance and saving. The analysis is grounded in a methodology in which concepts of European VAT are compared with concepts performing the same function in the Australian and New Zealand GST laws. The author concludes with proposals for reform in EU VAT in the light of experience in these two major non-EU countries. This book is the first comprehensive legal research devoted to the treatment of insurance in EU VAT published in English. The assessment of the EU VAT reform helps taxation authorities find practical ways to apply the rules of the VAT Directive to insurance transactions. Given that it has been proven that <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>VAT,</b> such as insurance, cause a significant number of economic distortions and inefficiencies, this study represents a major contribution to a topical debate in European VAT law for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars not only in Europe but across the world as well...|$|R

A particularly aspect has VAT with effect from 1 July 1993, as a Romanian fiscal system compatible with EU procedures. By the additions and changes to VAT management procedures for agricultural activities (<b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>VAT</b> of individual producers, the reverse charge in the production of cereals and technical crops, reducing the quota of VAT collected on chain at 9 % for bread), fiscal inequity was created between farmers according to the legal status of the organization and operation, between sectors of agricultural production, but also to the users of agricultural production. The most disadvantaged are those of 3, 859, 000 individual farmers, family farms and associations without legal status, that use 7. 45 million ha (56 % of the total utilized agricultural of 13, 306, 000 ha) ...|$|E
40|$|Harmonization of tax {{systems of}} the European Union member states {{has been going on}} since 1950 s. This trend is {{followed}} to this day in order to achieve one of the primary objectives of the European Union, single domestic market. The harmonization of tax systems allows free movement of capital, goods, and services. Value added tax is harmonized through the EU Directives that have unified tax object, tax base and partly tax rates. The Court of Justice of the European Union also plays a vital role in the harmonization, because the European case law complements the interpretation of the directives and creates a comprehensive impact throughout the harmonization. This thesis analyses the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which have been implemented in the VAT Act, and examines at the same time impact of the implementation. The first implementation took place in the amendment of the VAT Act in 2006. The biggest changes occurred in the amendment of the VAT Act in 2012 and it was mainly {{in the realm of the}} conditions for <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>VAT</b> without deduction and the possibility of claiming a deduction. Finally, time frame of the implementation was also researched, judging from the outcomes of the research, one can say that the Czech Republic responds quite flexibly to the publication of the European case of law and the implementation takes place shortly following verdict of The Court of Justice of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{and how to}} tax insurance, one of {{the crucial}} {{elements}} of the modern economy and society, is a complex issue {{for the design of}} laws on value added tax (VAT). <b>Exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>VAT</b> has been the most common international practice, and it is also applied in the harmonized system of European VAT. New Zealand and Australia are examples of legal systems in which an alternative to exemption, a full taxation model for general insurance, has been adopted. This thesis addresses the legal challenges inherent in the application of VAT to insurance, both from a system design perspective and {{from the perspective of the}} interpretation of existing rules in order to discuss the issue of the current and preferred legal treatment of insurance in European VAT. The study examines the functions of insurance, the legal nature of the insurance contract and the legal context in which insurance operates. It provides an in-depth analysis of how the existing rules on VAT should be applied to insurance transactions. The study also seeks to enhance our understanding of how insurance is treated in the legislation of the modern VAT systems of New Zealand and Australia. The exemption model is compared with two full-taxation models for general insurance. The analysis demonstrates that in the light of the legal character of VAT and the coherence of the European VAT system, the introduction of full taxation of general insurance constitutes a valid system design recommendation for the European Union...|$|E
30|$|Without doubt, {{significant}} {{health benefits}} can be gathered from implementing cleaner fuels and vehicles, with positive impacts {{in the overall}} quality of life of citizens. However, possible side effects need to be accounted for in advance. Countries that used target measures or incentives for electric vehicles such as Norway, France, Germany, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden have seen the highest take-up of electric vehicles. Measures included, for example the <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> 25  % <b>VAT</b> and other purchase taxes for new cars, and the use of bus lanes. Within the present special issue, the article by Aarestrup and Odeck refers to the particular case of Norway, the country with the largest fleet of BEVs per capita in the world, where incentives had visible benefits but other adverse effects occurred as well. For example, the <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> toll payments conducted to a reduction in toll revenues and providing access to bus lanes resulted in congestion effects.|$|R

In order to attract FDI, Kazakhstan lowered the tax burden for foreign investors. The corporate income tax rate dropped from 30% to 20%.

40|$|In 1997, Austrian private {{insurance}} companies saw their revenues from {{domestic and foreign}} premiums decline by 4. 4 percent to ATS 156 billion. They registered a fall of 6. 3 percent in their domestic direct business, but successful acquisitions of indirect business enabled them to compensate {{for part of the}} loss. Their volume of direct business in the Internal Market continues to be relatively small, but revenues could be boosted by more than half in 1997, reaching ATS 153 million. The decline of premiums for life insurance coverage (15. 9 percent) was primarily the result of flagging sales of lump-sum insurance products. Private old-age insurance products based on regular premium payments continued to be highly popular in 1997. Annuity and endowment insurance products had their premium volume pushed up by almost 46 percent, thanks to 215, 000 new contracts and a rise in average annual premiums to ATS 14, 700. Next to the general uncertainty about developments in the public old-age insurance system, a key factor for the upward trend {{appears to have been a}} successful drive to sell life insurance policies across the bank counter. Banks were the preferred distribution channel for Austrian life insurers (Fig. 1), in contrast to their European competitors with the exception of France where banks play a similarly dominant role. In Greece, Finland, Sweden, Germany and – surprisingly – the U. K., on the other hand, insurers used own agents as their chief distribution channel. For their indemnity and personal accident insurance products, Austrian insurers, like those in Sweden, bet on their traditional distribution channel: sales by their own agents. In other European countries sales through insurance brokers are a more important factor. Indeed, private insurers responded to the Internal Market by strengthening distribution through banks and through direct channels, although telephone sales were successful only in the U. K. and the Netherlands. The Internet is still a negligible factor, achieving a market share of about 1 percent only in Finland. The two remaining lines were unable to compensate losses from life insurance business in 1997 : with regard to supplementary health insurance, cost cuts achieved through <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>VAT</b> for medical and hospital services and through exemption of subsidies to the general hospital maintenance costs were partly passed on to policyholders by way of lower rates. Another factor contributing to the decline of 2. 1 percent was the decreasing number of policies. In the property and liability insurance sector, the fight for market shares in motor insurance resulted in weak growth of the premium volume (0. 7 percent).
