5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E

25|$|Magnus II, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, {{cousin of}} Erik XIV and future husband of Erik's {{half-sister}} Sophia, said that Sten Eriksson, Abraham Gustafsson and Ivar Ivarsson {{had had an}} outraged conversation in his presence about Nils Sture's humiliation and called for revenge; the accused confirmed this, but said that they <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> revenge against Persson and Jacob Teit of the High Court, not against the king.|$|E
25|$|Eric Stefani and John Spence {{met at a}} Dairy Queen and <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{getting a}} group {{together}} to play music. Eric got a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice. The practice included Eric Stefani (keyboards), Gwen Stefani (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez & Alan Meade (trumpet) and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.|$|E
25|$|Acquaintances said Spencer {{expressed}} {{hostility toward}} policemen, <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> shooting one, and had talked {{of doing something}} big to get on TV. Although Spencer showed exceptional ability in photography, winning first prize in a Humane Society competition, she was generally uninterested in school; one teacher recalled frequently inquiring if she was awake in class. Later, during tests {{while she was in}} custody, it was discovered Spencer had an injury to the temporal lobe of her brain. It was attributed to an accident on her bicycle.|$|E

25|$|The {{motives of}} the murder were not made clear during the trial. Was it a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about?</b> Or was it rather a hate crime, {{motivated}} by the anger Nödtveidt and Vlad had felt when confronted with Meddour's personality? According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, {{there is no denying}} that Nödtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a hate crime by the Swedish police.|$|E
25|$|Gessle and Fredriksson <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> working {{together}} for many years. Fredriksson had done backing vocal work for Gessle's band Gyllene Tider, {{and they had}} worked together on Spännande Ostar and other projects, including an attempt by Gyllene Tider to release an English language album in America. Fredriksson's career was soaring in Sweden, but Gessle was a former boyband member whose solo career was not doing as well. Friends {{and people in the}} industry were skeptical towards the idea of Marie collaborating with Gessle. His idea was to form a duo, singing in English, and try to have some success in Europe. However, during the 1980s, it was uncommon for Swedish artists to perform in English.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent the}} next {{two and a half years}} mainly at that place, it being a time of {{adjusting}} to new conditions. At first Lienhard worked as a farm hand and later left the Swiss settlement on occasion to travel up the Mississippi, taking on several jobs along the way in the hope of finding better-paid work. In the spring of 1846, while working in a shop in St. Louis, he met some old friends from Galena with whom only a year before he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> emigrating to California. They were just then preparing for that venture, and little effort was needed on their part to persuade him to join them in their undertaking.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Gerbic {{organized}} a sting on well-known psychic Chip Coffey which she code-named Operation Bumblebee. She and two associates created false identities and false dead relatives complete with backstories and pictures (of real, still living people) and attended a Coffey event in San Jose, CA. Mingling with attendees {{before the show}} started, the three talked {{as much as they}} could about their supposedly dead relatives, hoping that some of Coffey's assistants might overhear. During the show, Coffey did indeed do readings on each of the three, claiming to be in contact with each of the supposedly dead relatives, confidently relating details about completely made up people, including some of what Gerbic and her associates <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> before the show.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the last}} 20 years {{there has been}} an overt change in the {{policies}} of governments of Mesoamerican countries towards the indigenous languages. There has been official recognition of their right to existence and some kind of governmental support, to the point of recognizing them as national languages. Bilingual (rather than monolingual Spanish) education has been recognized as desirable even if not always actually achieved in practice. In Guatemala the recognition of the indigenous languages as official languages and a valuable part of the country’s identity came after the Civil War which ended in 1996. In Mexico shifting governments <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the value of the country’s indigenous heritage {{but it was not until}} 2003 that the Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages.|$|E
25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.|$|E
