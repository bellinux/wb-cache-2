"The {{date and}} the exact {{circumstances}} of the marriage are not recorded, but we may fairly suppose it {{to have taken place}} in the reign of Edward the Sixth (1547-1553), when ecclesiastical discipline was somewhat lax. The validity of it was evidently challenged in the stricter reign of Philip and Mary (1553-1558), for the parties found it desirable to have recourse to Rome. A solemn document issued by the Cardinal of St. Angelo, Papal Penitentiary, at St. Peter's, on the 28th of November 1558, recites that Thomas Luttrell Esquire and Margaret Hadley had by their petition confessed that they had, without proper dispensation, been actually married, although related in the third and third, and in the third and fourth <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>kindred,</b> and although spiritually related, the mother of Thomas having stood godmother to Margaret at her baptism or confirmation. The language of the document leaves it doubtful whether the marriage had been solemnized in public and whether any issue had been actually born. Its effect, however, was to release the parties from the excommunication that they had incurred on condition of a fresh marriage [...] "in the face of the church", and to legitimate any previous offspring. ... The dispensation, having been issued {{a few days after the}} accession of Elizabeth, was probably one of the very latest documents of the sort that was despatched before the final breach between England and Rome, and the sequel is perhaps the most curious part of the story. For nearly two years no further action was taken in the matter, but on the 27th of August 1560, Thomas Luttrell was solemnly married in the church of East Quantockshead, his bride being described in the register as [...] "Mrs (i.e. [...] "Mistress") Margaret Hadley". Their eldest son, George Luttrell, was born in the following month.

40|$|Abstract Background Having a child hospitalized is a {{stressful}} event for parents. Previous {{studies have found}} increased stress in families with children affected by different kinds of pathologies, and analyzed disease related objective variables producing stress. However, most of these studies recruited caregivers of children with chronic or serious illnesses, and focused on evaluation of objective environmental stressors and did not consider subjective "perception" of stress. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate perception of acute stress in caregivers taking care of children without serious physical damage that were hospitalized for short periods. Moreover, some variables, such as recreational and school services offered to children, influencing perception of cognitive, physiological and behavioral state relating to the sensation of "being stressed" were analyzed. Methods This study was realized with a sample of caregivers of children hospitalized for mild acute diseases. Research was conducted using two standardized tests, PSM (Psychological Stress Measure) and STAI (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), whose characteristics of reliability and validity had been successfully established. Results Present data showed that caregivers of hospitalized children perceived high levels of stress and anxiety. Perception of stress was influenced by the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>kindred</b> with patients, length of hospitalization, and, notably, participation in some of the activities offered to children, mainly school services. Discussion Findings showed that child hospitalization is {{a stressful}} event for caregivers, even if hospitalization is for middle and transient pathologies. Perception of stress was influenced by length of hospitalization, and by <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>kindred.</b> Findings even suggest that some services offered to children can modulate caregivers' perception of stress and impact of hospitalization. Caregivers whose children used school services describe themselves as less irritable and with higher emotional control compared to other caregivers. Considering the importance of education in a child's life, the possibility to continue school activities helped caregivers to feel less under pressure. In the light of this finding, amelioration of scholastic activities in pediatric departments may represent a critical point in order to provide a more agreeable hospital stay for children and their caregivers and, as a consequence, improve family involvement in care management. </p...|$|E

40|$|Glucokinase (GCK) is {{an enzyme}} that regulates insulin secretion, keeping glucose levels within a narrow range. Mutations in the {{glucokinase}} gene cause a rare form of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes {{of the young}} (MODY). An early onset (less than 25 years), autosomal dominant inheritance and low insulin secretion stimulated by glucose characterize MODY patients. Specific insulin and proinsulin were measured in serum by immunofluorimetric assays (IFMA) during a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Two kindreds (SA and LZ) were studied and compared to non-diabetic unrelated individuals (control group 1) matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In one <b>kindred,</b> some <b>of</b> these subjects were also obese (BMI > 26 kg/m 2), {{and other family members}} also presented with obesity and/or late-onset NIDDM. The MODY patients were also compared to a group of five of their first-degree relatives with obesity and/or late-onset NIDDM. The proinsulin profile was different in members of the two MODY kindreds. Fasting proinsulin and the proinsulin/insulin ratio were similar in MODY members <b>of</b> <b>kindred</b> LZ and subjects from control group 1, but were significantly lower than in MODY members <b>of</b> <b>kindred</b> SA (P< 0. 02 and P< 0. 01, for proinsulin and proinsulin/insulin ratio, respectively). Moreover, MODY members of family SA had higher levels of proinsulin and proinsulin/insulin ratio, although not significantly different, when compared to their first-degree relatives and to subjects from control group 2. In conclusion, we observed variable <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> proinsulin levels and proinsulin/insulin ratio in MODY members <b>of</b> two different <b>kindreds.</b> The higher values of these parameters found in MODY and non-MODY members <b>of</b> <b>kindred</b> SA is probably related to the obesity and late-onset NIDDM background present in this family...|$|R
