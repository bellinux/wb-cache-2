5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas.

5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E

5|$|During their expeditions aboard Mir, {{the astronauts}} carried out various experiments, {{including}} growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds {{of photographs of}} the Earth spinning serenely beneath them. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the aging station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks.

The enquiry also concluded that the outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing the sea should be filled in to form a more defensible line.|$|E

Following their advice, Haakon has a wooden man (Old Norse trémaðr) built out of driftwood and endows it with a human heart.

5|$|The John Bull had {{remained}} on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance {{as one of}} the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.|$|E

5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
