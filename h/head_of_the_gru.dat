5000|$|Greatest {{resources}} {{are devoted to}} these agents; which provide the most important material. Once the central headquarters assesses the materials as sufficiently valuable, the doctrine is to temporarily stop obtaining new material from the agent and improve their security {{as well as their}} knowledge of espionage tradecraft. This training is preferably done in a third country, from which the agent might or might not be moved to the Soviet Union. Typical cover for an agent absence would be taking a vacation or holiday.Thence he will go back to his own country, but as an independently acting agent. He will be run exclusively by the Centre, in concrete terms the head of a section, even, in special cases, the head of a directorate and in extreme cases the deputy <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GRU</b> or the head himself. The running of such an agent is thus carried out exactly as the running of illegals is.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simmering}} animosity {{between the}} two men finally boiled over on 14 April 2008, when a motorcade of Kadyrovtsy came face-to-face with a motorcade from a Vostok unit led by Badrudin Yamadaev - Sulim’s younger brother - in the town of Argun. [...] When neither group would allow the other to pass, Ramzan Kadyrov personally intervened {{in what appeared to be}} an effort to defuse the situation; Badrudin Yamadaev would later tell the Russian newspaper Gazeta that Kadyrov had hugged him and called him a “brother.” However, Kadyrov would then order that the Vostok stronghold of Gudermes be surrounded and the main base of the battalion in the city blocked; Chechen police officers loyal to Kadyrov then began detaining Vostok members, triggering an attack by the remainder of the unit on the barracks of the Kadyrovtsy located near the railroad station. The ensuing shootout lasted the entire day, with the opposing sides utilizing heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, and reportedly even armored vehicles. When Kadyrov called in reinforcements from around Chechnya, it resulted in Yamadaev’s men being outnumbered by the night of 15 April, with 300-500 police officers loyal to Kadyrov and members of the Sever and Yug battalions surrounding the Vostok base as well as the Yamadaev family’s private home in Gudermes. The situation was only resolved when the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, a deputy head of the Military Prosecutor’s Office for the Southern Federal District, the head of the Chechen branch of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GRU</b> staff in Chechnya, among others, accompanied by federal motorized rifle units, arrived on-scene and ordered Kadyrov’s squads to move back from both the Vostok base and the Yamadaev family’s house. While Kadyrov was enraged, he was unable to do anything about it and thus forced to acquiesce; the rebel website Kavkaz Center reported 16 members of the Vostok and Kadyrovtsy killed in the battle, while Reuters claimed that 18 people had died, including some civilians.|$|E
