500|$|All of Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} this volume and its predecessor, is [...] "very much {{concerned with what}} [...] knew and how she learned it". [...] Lupton compares Angelou's informal education described in this book with the education of other Black writers of the 20th century. [...] Like writers such as Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and James Baldwin, Angelou did not earn a college degree and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". She {{did not feel that}} her education ended at high school, however. [...] As Hagen points out, since Angelou was encouraged to appreciate literature as a young child, she continues to read, exposing herself {{to a wide variety of}} authors, ranging from Countee Cullen's poetry to Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors. She states, during her stint as a madame, [...] "when my life hinged melodramatically on intrigue and deceit, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> Russian writers".|$|E

The translator, Paul Sprachman, admired {{the book and}} said: [...] "I got {{a deeper understanding of}} the book, after the conversation I had with Seyyedeh Zahra Hossein, the narrator of Da. <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> difference between the Iran-Iraq war and other wars, after I read Da. It was, as Iranians say, a sacred defense and full of spirituality." ...|$|E
2500|$|While at Yale, {{he became}} a member of Skull and Bones. He served {{apprenticeships}} at Time, Life, the United States Information Agency, and American Heritage, where he enjoyed research. [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> endless fascination of doing the research and of doing the writing, I knew I had found what I wanted to do in my life." [...] While attending Yale, McCullough studied Arts and earned his bachelor's degree in English, with the intention of becoming a fiction writer or playwright. He graduated with honors in English literature (1955).|$|E
2500|$|R. N. Elliott's {{analysis}} of the mathematical properties of waves and patterns eventually led him to conclude that [...] "The Fibonacci Summation Series {{is the basis of}} The Wave Principle". Numbers from the Fibonacci sequence surface repeatedly in Elliott wave structures, including motive waves (1,3,5), a single full cycle (8waves), and the completed motive (89 waves) and corrective (55 waves) patterns. Elliott developed his market model before he realized that it reflects the Fibonacci sequence. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>The</b> Wave Principle action of market trends, I had never heard of either the Fibonacci Series or the Pythagorean Diagram".|$|E

If <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> <b>the</b> man's circumstances, which perhaps I am let into by some accident, I say, if <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> them, <b>the</b> man is undone; and if I do not, the tradesman, who is in danger of trusting him, is undone.|$|R

2500|$|A {{homosexual}} man {{who worked}} in a UMAP camp described the conditions there as follows, [...] "ork is hard because it's nearly always in the sun. We work 11 hours a day (cutting marble in a quarry) from {{seven in the morning}} to seven at night, with one hour's lunch break." [...] Fidel Castro visited one of the UMAP camps incognito to experience the treatment for himself. He was followed by 100 boys from the Young Communist League whose identity was also kept secret. In 1968, shortly after these visits, the camps closed. Castro said, [...] "They weren't units of internment or punishment.... However, after a visit <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> distortion in some places, of the original idea, because you can't deny that there were prejudices against homosexuals. I personally started a review of this matter. Those units only lasted three years." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{first she}} {{was no more than}} a blue-clad, white-aproned benevolence, that moved in the shadows behind the bed on which my old mother lay and sank restfully to death. She would come forward to {{anticipate}} some little need, to proffer some simple comfort, and always then my mother smiled on her. In a little while <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> beauty of that helpful poise of her woman's body, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> grace of untiring goodness, the sweetness of a tender pity, and the great riches of her voice, of her few reassuring words and phrases.
