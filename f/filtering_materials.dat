50|$|Agitation, heat, special baffling, {{coalescing}} packs, and <b>filtering</b> <b>materials</b> {{can assist}} in the removal of nonsolution gas that otherwise may be retained in the oil because of the viscosity and surface tension of the oil. Gas can {{be removed from the}} top of the drum by virtue of being gas. Oil and water are separated by a baffle at the end of the separator, which is set at a height close to the oil-water contact, allowing oil to spill over onto the other side, while trapping water on the near side. The two fluids can then be piped out of the separator from their respective sides of the baffle. The produced water is then either injected back into the oil reservoir, disposed of, or treated. The bulk level (gas-liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel. Valves on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation. The smaller droplets of water will not settle by gravity and will remain in the oil stream. Normally the oil from the separator is routed to a coalescer to further reduce the water content.|$|E

40|$|Adsorption of As(III) from aqueous {{solutions}} using {{naturally occurring}} and modified Algerian montmorillonites was investigated {{as a function}} of contact time, pH and temperature. Kinetic studies reveal that uptake of As(III) ions is rapid within the first 3 hours and it slows down thereafter.

A pseudo-second-order chemical reaction model was obtained for As(III). Adsorption isotherms of As(III) fitted the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models well.

40|$|Granular media {{filters are}} {{commonly}} used to remove suspended solids and prevent emitter clogging in microirrigation systems. Silica sand is the standard filtering media but other granular materials {{can be used for}} this purpose. The characterization of the pressure drop produced by the clean filtering media is of practical interest for designing and managing these filters. Different models such as Ergun or Kozeny-Carman equations are usually used to predict pressure drop produced by the filtering media. However, as parameters of the media such as equivalent diameter and sphericity, that are difficult to determine, appear in these equations, the objective {{of this study was to}} construct a new model to estimate the pressure drop of different <b>filtering</b> <b>materials</b> of interest in granular filters with limited data of the physical parameters that characterize the filtering media. This paper, taking as starting point the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), develops a new algorithm hybridizing it with the artificial bee colony (ABC) method, to estimate the pressure drop in granular filters broadly used in microirrigation systems for the first time with a data-driven model. Laboratory experiments were used to measure pressure drop across silica sand, crushed glass, modified glass and glass microspheres in a scaled filter at surface velocities ranging from 0. 004 to 0. 025 m s − 1. The ABC method allows the tuning of the MARS parameters during the training phase improving significantly the regression accuracy. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and M 5 model tree were fitted to the experimental data for comparison purposes. The results have shown that ABC-MARS-based model was the best estimation of the pressure drop with a coefficient of determination of 0. 78. Therefore, ABC-MARS-based model could be easily implemented to predict pressure drop with minimal input parameters for other <b>filtering</b> <b>materials</b> used in microirrigation media filtersAuthors wish to acknowledge the computational support provided by the Department of Mathematics at University of Oviedo as well as financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grant AGL 2015 - 63750 -...|$|E
