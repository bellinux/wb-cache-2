5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} benign and {{typically}} develop after {{a person has}} had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic <b>esophagitis.</b> A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, erosive <b>esophagitis,</b> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and eosinophilic <b>esophagitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary uses of esomeprazole are {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease, {{treatment and}} maintenance of erosive <b>esophagitis,</b> treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|Eosinophilic {{inflammation}} (usually due to reflux): The {{presence of}} intraepithelial eosinophils may suggest {{a diagnosis of}} eosinophilic <b>esophagitis</b> (EE) if eosinophils are present in high enough numbers. Less than 20 eosinophils per high-power microscopic field in the distal esophagus, {{in the presence of}} other histologic features of GERD, is more consistent with GERD than EE.|$|E
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), {{also known}} as acid reflux, is a {{long-term}} condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. Symptoms include the taste of acid {{in the back of}} the mouth, heartburn, bad breath, chest pain, vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications include <b>esophagitis,</b> esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from {{infrequent}} heartburn may take either antacids or H2-receptor antagonists for treatment. The H2-antagonists offer several advantages over antacids, including longer duration of action (6–10 hours vs 1–2 hours for antacids), greater efficacy, and ability to be used prophylactically before meals to reduce the chance of heartburn occurring. Proton pump inhibitors, however, are the preferred treatment for erosive <b>esophagitis</b> since they {{have been shown to}} promote healing better than H2-antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Scleroderma can {{decrease}} motility {{anywhere in}} the gastrointestinal tract. The most common source of decreased motility is the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to dysphagia and chest pain. As scleroderma progresses, esophageal involvement from abnormalities in decreased motility may worsen due to progressive fibrosis (scarring). If this is left untreated, acid from the stomach can back up into the esophagus, causing <b>esophagitis</b> and GERD. Further scarring from acid damage to the lower esophagus many times leads {{to the development of}} fibrotic narrowing, also known as strictures which can be treated by dilatation, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
500|$|Inflammation of the {{esophagus}} {{is known as}} <b>esophagitis.</b> Reflux of gastric acids from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications (such as bisphosphonates), and food allergies can all lead to <b>esophagitis.</b> Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the yeast candida albicans that may occur {{when a person is}} immunocompromised. [...] the cause of some forms of <b>esophagitis,</b> such as eosinophilic <b>esophagitis,</b> is not known. <b>Esophagitis</b> can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the <b>esophagitis</b> - such as managing reflux or treating infection.|$|E
500|$|Prolonged <b>esophagitis,</b> {{particularly}} from gastric reflux, is one factor thought {{to play a}} role in the development of Barrett's esophagus. In this condition, there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus, which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia. [...] Barrett's esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Diffuse {{scleroderma}} {{can affect}} {{any part of}} the gastrointestinal tract. [...] The most common manifestation in the esophagus is reflux <b>esophagitis,</b> which may be complicated by peptic stricturing, or benign narrowing of the esophagus. [...] This is best initially treated with proton pump inhibitors for acid suppression, but may require bougie dilatation in the case of stricture.|$|E
2500|$|Buchholz {{started the}} 2012 season 8-2, winning four {{consecutive}} decisions. However, {{he was placed}} on the 15-day disabled list after he was hospitalized with a [...] "gastrointestinal situation", stated then-manager Bobby Valentine. On August 16, Buchholz pitched an immaculate inning against the Baltimore Orioles in the sixth inning. He {{went on to win the}} game 6-3 in eight innings of work. On June 26, he was diagnosed with <b>esophagitis,</b> an inflammation that damages tissues of the esophagus. For the 2012 year, Buchholz made 29 starts with an 11-8 record and a 4.56 ERA.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main cause}} of Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{is thought to be}} an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux <b>esophagitis.</b> [...] The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the Western world in recent years. The condition is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett's esophagus do not have symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy (more specifically, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a procedure in which a fibreoptic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) and biopsy. The cells of Barrett's esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: nondysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. [...] High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by endoscopic resection and new endoscopic therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, whereas advanced stages (submucosal) are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment. [...] Nondysplastic and low-grade patients are generally advised to undergo annual observation with endoscopy, with radiofrequency ablation as a therapeutic option. [...] In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater.|$|E
