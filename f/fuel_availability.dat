40|$|The {{decrease}} of fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>availability</b> {{and the consequent}} increase of their price {{have led to a}} rapid evolution of renewable market and policy frameworks in recent years. Renewable resources include solar radiation, which is of considerable interest as it is inexhaustible, free, and clean. In order to calculate how much work can be obtained from solar radiation, several methods have been proposed in the literature and are here reviewed. In this paper, a single exergy factor to be applied to the total radiation measured on horizontal surface in a given place is proposed. The factor is estimated from both direct and diffuse radiation...|$|R

40|$|Rural {{population}} of India constitutes about 70 % {{of the total}} population and traditional fuels account for 75 % of the rural energy needs. Depletion of woodlands coupled with the persistent dependency on fuel wood has posed a serious problem for household energy provision in many parts. This study highlights that the traditional fuels still meet 85 - 95 % of fuel needs in rural areas of Kolar district: people prefer fuel wood for cooking and agriculture residues for water heating and other purposes. However, rapid changes in land cover and land use in recent times have affected these traditional <b>fuels</b> <b>availability</b> necessitating inventorying, mapping and monitoring of bioresources for sustainable management of bioresources. Remote sensing data (Multispectal and Panchromatic), Geographic Information System (GIS), field surveys and non-destructive sampling were used to assess spatially the availability and demand of energy. Field surveys indicate that rural household depends on species such as Prosopis juliflora, Acacia nilotica, Acacia auriculiformis to meet fuel wood requirement for domestic activities. Hence, to take stock of <b>fuel</b> wood <b>availability,</b> mapping was done at species level (with 88 % accuracy) considering villages as sampling units using fused multispectral and panchromatic data.

40|$|SummaryRapid {{regulation}} of oxidative phosphorylation {{is crucial for}} mitochondrial adaptation to swift changes in <b>fuels</b> <b>availability</b> and energy demands. An intramitochondrial signaling pathway regulates cytochrome oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, through reversible phosphorylation. We find that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of a COX subunit dictates mammalian mitochondrial energy fluxes and identify the specific residue (S 58) of COX subunit IV- 1 (COXIV- 1) that is involved in this mechanism of metabolic regulation. Using protein mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and induced fit docking, we show that mitochondrial energy metabolism regulation by phosphorylation of COXIV- 1 is coupled with prevention of COX allosteric inhibition by ATP. This regulatory mechanism is essential for efficient oxidative metabolism and cell survival. We propose that S 58 COXIV- 1 phosphorylation has evolved as a metabolic switch that allows mammalian mitochondria to rapidly toggle between energy utilization and energy storage...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{security}} {{improvement is}} often {{presented as a}} co-benefit of climate policies. This paper evaluates this claim. It presents a methodology to investigate whether climate policy would improve energy security, while accounting for the difficulties entailed by the many-faceted nature of the concept and the large uncertainties on the determinants of future energy systems. A four-dimension analysis grid is used to capture the energy security concept, and a database of scenarios allows us to explore the uncertainty space. The results, focusing on Europe, reveal there is no unequivocal effect of climate policy on all the dimensions of energy security. Moreover, time matters: the effect of climate policy depends on the time horizon considered. Lastly, these results are robust to uncertainties on drivers of economic growth and the potentials and costs of end-uses technologies, but are sensitive to fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>availability,</b> low carbon technologies in the energy sector and improvements in energy efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The Turkish {{electrical}} {{system has been}} studied, particularly for the near term investment programme. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the most likely investment alternatives for the next ten-year period, from a cost effectiveness point of view. A dynamic linear programming model was used in representing the national energy system, with special emphasis on the electricity sector. Hydro, coal, nuclear and oil-fired power plants as well as their interconnection investments were modelled. A 27 -year planning horizon was defined. The scenario approach was utilized in establishing the effects of different factors, such as foreign currency requirements of projects, nuclear plant costs and nuclear fuel costs, demand growth rates for electricity as well as other <b>fuels,</b> <b>availability</b> of foreign currency and skilled manpower, and the development rates of coal mines, coal power plants and nuclear power plants.

50|$|Methanol is an {{alternative}} fuel for internal combustion and other engines, either in combination with gasoline or directly ("neat"). It is used in racing cars in many countries. In the U.S., methanol fuel has received less attention than ethanol fuel as {{an alternative}} to petroleum-based fuels.

However, for optimizing engine performance, <b>fuel</b> <b>availability,</b> toxicity and political advantage, a blend of ethanol, methanol and petroleum is likely to be preferable to using any of these individual substances alone.
