It is generally regarded as a medical problem when at least 10% of a person's body weight has been lost in six months or 5% in the last month. Another criterion used for assessing weight that is too low is the body mass index (BMI). However, even lesser amounts of weight loss can be a cause for serious concern in a frail <b>elderly</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an <b>elderly</b> <b>person</b> feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is important to take these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|Insects are {{valuable}} as forensic indicators {{in cases of}} abuse and neglect. Some insects, such as the Green Bottle Fly, (Lucilia sericata (Meigen)), are drawn to odors, such as ammonia, resulting from urine or fecal contamination. Adult green bottle flies tend to be attracted to an incontinent individual who lacks the voluntary control of excretory functions. Such examples include a baby who has not had its diapers changed often or an incontinent <b>elderly</b> <b>person</b> {{who has not been}} helped in maintaining routine bodily hygiene. Flies lay their eggs in and around clothing and skin which, if left undiscovered, will hatch into maggots (larvae) which begin feeding upon flesh, open wounds, ulcers, and any natural bodily entry point. Over time, the flesh will be eaten away, and the region may be further infected by bacteria or invaded by other insects. This is known as myiasis.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Elderly persons use drugs {{at a higher rate}} than younger persons, in part because <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> experience higher rates of certain diseases [...] such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, and heart disorders. <b>Elderly</b> <b>persons</b> [...] those age 65 and older [...] are also more likely than younger adults to experience complications when taking some prescription drugs. For example, because of their decreased liver and kidney functions, <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> often lack the ability to eliminate drugs from their bodies as efficiently as younger adults, making <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> more likely to experience side effects associated with drugs. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that it is important that drugs be studied for use by <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> during the clinical drug trials [...] that is, those drug studies conducted by drug sponsors before they submit an application to have a drug approved for marketing. FDA is responsible for oversight of clinical drug trials and deciding whether to approve new drugs for marketing in the United States. This responsibility includes determining if drugs are safe and effective for the people expected to use them, including <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> To implement its responsibilities, FDA issues guidance and regulations for drug sponsors on conducting clinical drug trials and submitting new drug applications (NDA) to FDA to seek drug approval based in part on the results of those clinical drug trials. NDAs include data on both the safety and effectiveness of the drug being studied. FDA guidance describes the process FDA medical officers (typically doctors) are to follow in reviewing those NDAs as part of the NDA review process and recommending whether to approve a new drug for marketing in the United States. As part of the process by which drugs are considered for approval, medical officers also meet in teams with supervisors and other experts, including biochemists and statisticians, to discuss the merits of the NDA. Concerns have been raised about the inclusion of <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> in clinical drug trials. 7 You asked us to examine FDA's activities related to data reported about <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> in the study of new drugs. In this report, we examine FDA's guidance and regulations related to (1) drug sponsors' reporting of data to FDA to describe the effects of a proposed drug on <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> and (2) FDA medical officers' review of safety and effectiveness data that drug sponsors provided for <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> Assessing whether a drug is safe and effective for use by <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> requires that a sufficient number of <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> be included in clinical drug trials. As the number of elderly participants in clinical drug trials increases, the ability of drug sponsors to detect responses unique to <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> for a given safety or effectiveness outcome also increases. Failing to include sufficient numbers of <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> in clinical drug trials may make it less likely that safety concerns and effectiveness outcomes unique to <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> will be detected during the clinical drug trials. FDA's guidance recommends that drug sponsors not exclude <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> from clinical drug trials {{on the basis of their}} age alone because such exclusions might prevent drug sponsors from collecting sufficient information about the effects of drugs in <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> 20 Instead, the guidance suggests that, when necessary, exclusion criteria should focus on more relevant issues, such as either the presence of an illness that could make participation in the clinical drug trial dangerous or the person's inability to provide informed consent. ...|$|R

2500|$|The early {{influx of}} Filipinos into the United States was {{in large part}} due to social {{programs}} such as the pensionando program and the necessity for labor in certain areas such as California and Alaska. Laborers and farmers who migrated from the Philippines were known as the [...] "Manong" [...] Generation, an Ilocano term referring to an <b>elderly</b> <b>person.</b> [...] Filipino migrant workers began coming to the U.S. around the start of the 20th century; they were mostly men who worked in either California or Alaska. Some had worked in the sugar planations of Hawaii as well, but this occurred before Hawaii became a state. These men were referred to as the “Manong” generation, which is an Ilocano term designated for elderly people. For many Filipino laborers and workers during this time period, there was an emphasis on dressing well. This happened for multiple reasons. First, Filipino laborers looked to disassociate themselves from lower class citizens. Another reason included the desire to emulate Hollywood actors during the 1920’s and 1930’s. Filipinos were unable to rent or own homes in cities such as Los Angeles, so they spent their money on other things such as clothing. In living spaces, Filipinos were confined to upwards of fifteen to twenty tenants in a single room to save money. This allowed for Filipinos to spend their money on clothing instead of rent and other possessions instead. Also, Filipinos were portrayed as weak, submissive, unassertive, and eager to please; dressing well was perceived to counter those stereotypes. Despite earning meager wages, Filipino laborers bought nice clothing as a means to appear nicer than their pay would suggest. Lastly, another reason for the desire to dress well was to impress relatives back in the Philippines. Filipino laborers sent pictures of themselves in their suits in order to give them the impression they were quite successful in America.|$|E
40|$|Background. Although {{postural}} {{recovery is}} attentionally demanding in healthy <b>elderly</b> <b>persons,</b> {{an inability to}} recover balance due to competition for attentional resources between the postural system and a second task could contribute to falls in older adults with poor balance. This study examined the attentional demands of balance recovery from a mild postural disturbance in balance-impaired <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> A second purpose {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of performing a cognitive task on the recovery of balance in balance-impaired <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> Methods. Fifteen healthy older adults and 13 older adults with clinical balance impairment were exposed to balance disturbances by means of sudden movement of a platform on which they stood. A dual-task paradigm where postural recovery served as the primary task and verbal reaction time to auditory tones served as the. secondary task was used to assess attentional demand. To determine the effect of the cognitive task on postural recovery, kinetic, kinematic, and neuromuscular measures of a feet-in-place response were investigated. Results. Balance recovery using a feet-in-place response was attentionally demanding in both groups of older adults and was more demanding in balance-impaired than in healthy <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> With the concurrent performance of a cognitive task, balance-impaired <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> took longer to stabilize their center of pressure and regain balance than in a sing le task, while healthy <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> showed no change between conditions. In addition, only balance-impaired elderly individuals had a greater center-of-pressure resultant velocity during recovery in a dual-task compared with a single-task Situation. Conclusions. The ability to recover balance using a feet-in-place response was more attentionally demanding in balance-impaired than in healthy <b>elderly</b> <b>persons.</b> The recovery of balance was also slower and less efficient in balance-impaired <b>elderly</b> <b>persons</b> when simultaneously performing a cognitive task, whereas the ability of healthy elderly individuals to recover was not influenced by concurrent task demands.
