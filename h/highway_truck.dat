500|$|The album {{features}} more positive and uplifting lyrics {{in comparison with}} Green Day's earlier work. Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason why I was really taking my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E
2500|$|The track {{crew was}} laid off in 1933, and the train crew became {{responsible}} for right-of-way maintenance and freight transfer at Monson Junction. [...] Locomotive #3 was the only operable engine after 1936. [...] Passengers, mail, and express were carried in a Slate Company <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> when the locomotive required repairs. [...] Passenger service was discontinued on November 1, 1938.|$|E
2500|$|The Monson {{engine house}} burned on November 3, 1919. [...] Vulcan {{locomotives}} 3 and 4 were damaged, and old Hinkley #1 {{was considered a}} total loss. [...] A <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> handled mail and express shipments for ten days until engine number 4 was repaired. [...] Engine number 3 returned to service on November 20, and the engine house was rebuilt in June 1920.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 the Soviet Union {{fell apart}} and its largest republic, the Russian Federation, which then hauled about 2/3 {{of the traffic}} of the former USSR, became an {{independent}} country. [...] For the USSR in 1989, shortly before the collapse of Soviet Union, the railway hauled nearly eight times as much ton-km of freight by rail as they did by <b>highway</b> <b>truck.</b> [...] In 1991 a law was passed which declared that railway were the basic transportation system of the USSR.|$|E
2500|$|Monson {{became the}} last of Maine's - and the nation's - [...] gauge railroads in {{commercial}} operation when the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad was dismantled in 1941. Infrequent flat car loads of crated slate products moved to Monson Junction until July 12, 1943. [...] On that date Monson Slate Company received permission to use a <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> for common carrier service. [...] The railroad was dismantled {{during the winter of}} 1943-44 and the engine house became a garage for the truck.|$|E
2500|$|Coal is {{delivered}} by <b>highway</b> <b>truck,</b> rail, barge, collier ship or coal slurry pipeline. Some plants are even built near coal mines and coal {{is delivered}} by conveyors. A large coal train called a [...] "unit train" [...] may be two kilometers (over a mile) long, containing 130-140 cars with 100 short tons of coal in each one, {{for a total}} load of over 15,000 tons. A large plant under full load requires at least one coal delivery this size every day. Plants may get {{as many as three}} to five trains a day, especially in [...] "peak season" [...] during the hottest summer or coldest winter months (depending on local climate) when power consumption is high. A large thermal power plant such as the now decommissioned Nanticoke, Ontario stores several million metric tons of coal for winter use when the lakes are frozen.|$|E

50|$|GMC {{produced}} a 637 CID L 60° V8 {{with a single}} balance shaft using the same general layout (bore and stroke) as the 478 V6. The 637 V8 was the largest displacement production gasoline V8 ever made for <b>highway</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|NS {{is a major}} {{transporter}} {{of domestic}} and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, {{as well as the}} Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the [...] "Clearfield Cluster". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> trailers with interchangeable wheel sets.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first big}} truck-driving hit from Sovine, [...] "Giddyup Go" [...] is {{the tale of}} an {{emotional}} father-son reunion at a <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> stop. The reunion is played out {{near the end of}} the song.|$|E
50|$|Brushless {{versions}} of these type alternators are also common in larger machinery such as <b>highway</b> <b>trucks</b> and earthmoving machinery. With two oversized shaft bearings {{as the only}} wearing parts, these can provide extremely long and reliable service, even exceeding the engine overhaul intervals.|$|R
50|$|In 1928 Oxford Paper Company began {{shipping}} pulpwood from Barnjum {{to their}} mill in Rumford Falls. The receivers operated extra winter trains to Barnjum, and {{were encouraged to}} resume full year service over the former P&R commencing 20 May 1929. The last steam train left Rangeley in May 1931 and railcar service over the former P&R north of Phillips ended {{in the autumn of}} 1931. Following a precedent set three years earlier on the Kennebec Central Railroad, Maxey suspended all train and railcar service when the last mills shipping their products via the SR&RL transferred their business to <b>highway</b> <b>trucking</b> firms. Two SR&RL <b>highway</b> <b>trucks</b> began carrying express shipments on 8 July 1932, and no trains operated over any part of the railroad through the following winter.|$|R

25|$|In its heyday, Qu'Appelle {{was located}} on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) some 400m (a quarter of a mile) to the north.

50|$|The Mack Titan is a {{heavy duty}} truck {{produced}} by Mack Trucks. Two variants are produced, one for the Australian market, introduced in 1995 aimed at heavy road train operators, and a 2008 version introduced in North America.

5000|$|The largest <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> sold by Peterbilt at its launch, the 379 was {{produced}} in two configurations. The standard hood created a BBC (bumper to back of cab length) of 119 inches. To allow for larger engines and radiators, an extended hood configuration was available, which made for a 127-inch BBC. Although sharing the bare cab structure with the 359, the 379 {{was produced}} with a slightly larger windshield and horizontally-mounted windshield wipers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{area that}} is now Birdsall was first settled around 1816. The town of Birdsall was created in 1829 from parts of the towns of Almond and Allen. [...] From 1882 to April 1, 1947, Birdsall was located on the main line of the Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad and predecessors. It was {{abandoned}} on the latter date by the U. S.

Following severe floods in July 1935 the {{railroad}} was partially out of service and its abandonment in June 1936 was readily approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission which from an early date approved railroad abandonment to promote <b>highway</b> <b>truck</b> use. The loss of railroad service did much to promote the economic withering of the Greenwood area.|$|E
