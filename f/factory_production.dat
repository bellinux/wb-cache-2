5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for <b>factory</b> <b>production.</b> As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E

25|$|The 1830s saw a {{slump in}} the industry, {{due in part}} to the {{introduction}} of <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> at Coventry, and competition from cheap imports. However, the 1840s brought another period of growth when many buildings were re-fronted or rebuilt in chequered brick work (characteristic of North Warwickshire buildings of the period).|$|E
25|$|In other {{industries}} {{the transition to}} <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers.

25|$|The Arts and Crafts {{movement}} {{emerged from}} the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid 19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and <b>factory</b> <b>production.</b> Their critique was sharpened by the items they saw in the Great Exhibition of 1851, which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the modern-day Republic of Turkey, grape-based rakı began to be distilled by the state-owned spirits monopoly Tekel, with the first <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> taking place in 1944 in Izmir. With increasing sugar beet production, Tekel also began to distill the alcohol from molasses, and a new brand of raki made from sugar-beet alcohol was introduced under the name Yeni Rakı ("New Rakı"). Molasses gave Yeni Rakı a distinctive bitter taste and helped increase the drink's popularity.|$|E
25|$|The celebrated New Left {{historian}} Robert Brenner from California {{has also}} attempted {{to provide an}} explanation of the postwar boom and its aftermath in terms of profitability trends. Brenner's interpretation was heavily criticized by Anwar Shaikh, who argued that it is not really credible from an econometric or theoretical point of view. According to Shaikh, Brenner had an inflated view of American factories, to the point where Brenner believed that the profitability of US manufacturing determined the destiny of the whole world economy. In reality, US <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> wasn't that big.|$|E

25|$|The rope factory was renewed in 1837 after plans by {{architect}} Pehr Johan Gylich; it {{was further}} extended in 1842. The <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> was {{used at the}} yard and also sold outside. The building was the longest in Finland at its time. During the 1840s the yard experience an increased order intake, mainly from Russia, and the yard area was enlarged towards downstream of the river in 1846, when the company bought a lot next to the Turku Castle. Also a new slipway equipped with a mechanical winch was built primarily for reparations of increasingly common steamships.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a desire {{on the part of}} Soviet {{officials}} to forestall any evacuations until it was absolutely necessary, the marching orders were often to continue <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> until the eve of occupation before hurriedly dismantling and transporting factory equipment, and destroying what couldn't be moved in time. As a result of the delay in evacuations, they were often carried out under German aerial bombardment, which led to additional confusion among the frightened citizenry. Historian Rebecca Manley describes these early evacuations as being charactered by “three phenomena: the 'flight' of officials, the flight of the population, and 'panic'”.|$|E

25|$|World War I {{added to}} the chaos. Conscription swept up the unwilling across Russia. The vast demand for <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> of war {{supplies}} and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities, {{who had to be}} replaced with unskilled peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food. Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the Tsar.|$|E
25|$|From the 19th century, {{there was}} a revival in many ancient glass-making {{techniques}} including cameo glass, achieved {{for the first time}} since the Roman Empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using luster techniques. Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps. The early 20th-century saw the large-scale <b>factory</b> <b>production</b> of glass art by firms such as Waterford and Lalique. From about 1960 onwards, there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part fine arts.|$|E
