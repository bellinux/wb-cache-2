5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this,</b> I would get one every time.|$|E
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> year." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferrari {{hosted a}} press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher {{admitted}} that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgement rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve. [...] "I am human like everyone else and unfortunately I made a mistake," [...] he said. [...] "I don't make many but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> time." [...] In their respective books on Schumacher, James Allen and Swiss motorsports author Luc Domenjoz have both since expressed the view that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast, and without Schumacher turning into him would have overshot the turn.|$|E

500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E

500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 2009, Barton was {{questioned}} by the Indian media on why she chose to sign on the project to which she responded [...] "I'm interested {{in all kinds of}} things, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> film for moral reasons. Also, I felt the story needed to be told, I feel {{that this is going to}} be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Hellman {{declined}} {{when asked}} to adapt Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl (1952) for the stage. According to writer and director Garson Kanin, {{she said that the}} diary was [...] "a great historical work which will probably live forever, but I couldn't be more wrong as the adapter. If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> it would run one night because it would be deeply depressing.

2500|$|After the feat, Wallenda {{said he was}} [...] "not scared at all," [...] but {{admitted}} that the circumstances of Karl's death had haunted him for years.

[...] "To {{be able to walk}} in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> for him as much as I did it for my family to get some closure." [...] He also called the walk the biggest and most emotional moment of his career to that point. [...] "I can't even put it into words. It was so emotional", he said a week later.|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E

2500|$|Now I {{will never}} forget this incident... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other {{frontier}} base and word came through about 6 {{o'clock in the morning}} that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [...] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I {{will never forget}} arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground... Monty had him [...] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said [...] "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." [...] Monty said [...] "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fearful of the {{perceived}} humiliation {{of being the first}} to lose to Tampa Bay, opponents prepared carefully for the Buccaneers. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach said, [...] "...we didn't want to be the first. Psychologically, it could have wrecked our year". New York Giants coach John McVay said after a victory, [...] "In 25 years of coaching I've never had as much pressure on me as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> week". A popular Tampa area T-shirt depicted a sinking pirate ship with the inscription [...] "Go for 0". The franchise finally broke through to victory in a week 13 road game against the New Orleans Saints that led Saints head coach Hank Stram to lament, [...] "What a nightmare. It was the worst experience of my coaching career. We're all ashamed for our people, for our fans, for our organization". Stram, an early head coaching candidate for the expansion Buccaneers, was fired the following week. The first Buccaneer home victory came in the following week's season-ending game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Cardinals coach Don Coryell, already feuding with team owner Bill Bidwill, was also fired shortly after the loss. The two-game winning streak ended the Buccaneers’ losing streak at 0–26. Howard Cosell honored the Buccaneers’ first victory by choosing it as the lead game for the halftime highlights of ABC TV's Monday Night Football broadcast, and interviewed McKay by telephone during the game. Bill Cosby, filling in for longtime Buccaneer mocker Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show, devoted a five-minute comedy routine to the win. No Buccaneers were honored with Pro Bowl selections following the season, although it was believed that Lee Roy Selmon, Dave Lewis, and Dave Pear would all have been chosen had they played on a playoff contender.|$|E
