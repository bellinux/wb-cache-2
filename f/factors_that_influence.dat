To investigate the <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>influences</b> students’ WTC in the classroom, a classroom observation guide {{is used to}} record observations on students’ communicative behaviour during a lesson. Students’ perception on <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>influences</b> their WTC was also investigated by way of group interview using a set of interview questions (including stimulated recall). The data obtained from both were compared to see the correspondence between students’ self-report WTC and students’ communication behaviour in the classroom. The analysis was based on recurring themes or influences throughout the literature concerning WTC. The {{findings of this study}} reveal that students’ self-report WTC and actual communication behaviour do correspond to a certain extent. This is attributed to the complex interrelationship between the <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>influences</b> WTC. These findings, although by no means definitive, contribute to an understanding of students’ WTC in a Malaysian classroom...|$|R
