5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally.

He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek <b>figures.</b> <b>It</b> has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
