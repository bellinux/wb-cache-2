25|$|Various {{carriages}} were fitted or retrofitted with <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> {{to allow}} their operation in a railcar train. There were at least 88 trailers in total, including pre-1950s stock (one example dating from 1902), 1950s CIÉ vehicles, other 1950s stock from Park Royal Vehicles (manufacturer of the railcars' own bodywork) and 1960s Cravens vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Commencing in 2013, five GB Railfreight Class 73 were re-engined as Class 73/9 by Brush Traction Wabtec {{at their}} factory in Loughborough. The first three {{converted}} locomotives, renumbered 73961-3 from 73209, 73204 and 73206 respectively, were fitted with MTU 1,600hp V8 engines. All existing mechanical and electrical components were removed {{prior to the}} re-fit, and the frontal appearance of the locomotives has been altered by the provision of light clusters and the installation of a more central location for the <b>jumper</b> <b>cables.</b> The dual driving positions have been retained although with a new design for the driver's controls. The refurbished locomotives will be capable of working with existing Class 73/1 and 73/2 units in either diesel or electric mode.|$|E
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core <b>jumper</b> <b>cables.</b> The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E

25|$|Prejudice against {{hydraulic}} transmission {{in the higher}} echelons of BR's engineering divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for extra equipment. It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an exhauster, so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric train heating (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the fitment of charge-air coolers. No work was actually carried out, other than the fitment of appropriate <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> on the locomotive ends.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of suitable stock for the Bournemouth electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage 8Vab unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4-TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting. in the TC unit as the 8-VAB was not fitted with ETH <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4-VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4-REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as Class 480 following the introduction of TOPS.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{is always}} {{required}} {{to establish an}} outgoing wormhole, and is usually supplied by the DHD, but any Stargate can receive a wormhole whether it has a power supply or not; either gate may supply the power once a wormhole has been established. In a few cases, Stargates have been dialed [...] "manually" [...] when more sophisticated means were not available. This was accomplished by providing sufficient raw power to the gate and then rotating the symbol ring by hand to encode each chevron. Power can be fed directly into the Naquadah that composes the gate; power harnessed from lightning strikes {{has been shown to}} be sufficient, as has the energy from the core of a naquadah bomb., however the minimum requirement for a stable wormhole appears to be a 12 or 24 volt current (depending on wiring) as shown in the episode [...] "1969" [...] where the team powers the gate using <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> hooked up to two military transport trucks. The Stargate that establishes an outgoing wormhole determines how long the wormhole is held open, and can generally close the wormhole at will. Under some conditions, a gate only needs enough power to connect briefly, then the receiving gate can provide enough power to maintain the connection. The same is true if the outgoing gate loses power while transmitting; if the incoming gate has a DHD, it will take over powering the gate until reintegration is complete. The System Lord Anubis possessed an Ancient weapon that would channel energy into a receiving Stargate through an open dialed gate; prolonged use of this weapon would cause the gate's Naquadah to continue to absorb the energy until a significant explosion would take place.|$|E
