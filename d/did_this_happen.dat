2500|$|Herodotus {{attributes}} {{cause to}} both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This {{is true of}} Greek thinking in general, at least from Homer onward. Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question [...] "why did this happen?" [...] but rather [...] "why <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> to me?" [...] By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will {{is the reason that}} the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.|$|E
2500|$|PTSD is {{an anxiety}} {{disorder}} caused {{by exposure to}} a terrifying event or ordeal involving the occurrence or threat of physical harm. [...] It {{is one of the}} most severe and well-known of the different types of psychological trauma, mostly due to its prevalence in war veterans. [...] As mentioned above, the stress of PTSD can have severe effects on the hippocampus, causing problems with transferring short-term to long-term memory. [...] There is no one way that patients' memories are affected by PTSD, as shown by a variety of studies. Typically symptoms include avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event or mention thereof, irritability, trouble sleeping, emotional numbness and exaggerated reactions to surprises. [...] One of the most common and powerful symptoms, is the recurrence of random intense memories from the event (intrusive thoughts). [...] This can manifest itself in different ways such as flashbacks of the event and unwanted thoughts about the trauma (e.g. [...] "why <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> to me?"). PTSD patients who have gone through different traumatic experiences will have small variances in their symptoms, mostly insignificant. [...] For example, PTSD patients who were rape victims will have aversion to words such as touch and dirty while patients who were in a fire or war experience will respond similarly to words like burn or fight.|$|E

60|$|In Godfrey's {{case with}} Isobel, {{not only did}} the doorway {{remained}} unfilled--the door itself was always ajar. Although seas divided them and over these no whisper came, yet he felt her thought leaping to him across the world.

60|$|Then {{there was}} his {{lightning}} quickness. It gave him a tremendous advantage over his antagonists. No matter what their fighting experience, they had never encountered a dog that moved so swiftly as he. Also to be reckoned with, was the immediateness of his attack.

So often <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen,</b> that it became the custom to hold White Fang until the other dog went through its preliminaries, was good and ready, and even made the first attack.|$|E

Then he retired, and the other capadore played with the bull. After that they placed the banderillos in the bull, in the shoulders, {{on each side of}} the back-bone, two at a time. Then stepped forward Ordonez, the chief matador, with the long sword and the scarlet cape. The bugles blew for the death. He is not so good as Matestini. Still he is good, and with one thrust he drove the sword to the heart, and the bull doubled his legs under him and lay down and died. It was a pretty thrust, clean and sure; and there was much applause, and many of the common people threw their hats into the ring. Maria Valenzuela {{clapped her hands}} with the rest, and John Harned, whose cold heart was not touched by the event, looked at her with curiosity.|$|E
