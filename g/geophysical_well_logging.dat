5000|$|James E. Atwater (born 1946) is {{a retired}} North American {{multidisciplinary}} physical scientist with training in geophysics, chemistry and biological science. He was awarded the Wright Brothers Medal {{for his work on}} microwave powered methods for microbial stabilization and water recovery from solid waste. Atwater served in the United States Marine Corps 1963-1967 prior to attending the University of Utah 1968-1975. In his early career 1977-1980 Atwater concentrated on methods and instrumentation for identification and quantification of radionuclides associated with uranium exploration and recovery by gamma ray and alpha particle energy spectrometry. Subsequently 1980-1987 he applied radiometric <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> techniques to the characterization of sandstone, limestone, dolomite and shale core samples. At this time he also refined methods for the determination of porosity and permeability of unconsolidated bitumen and heavy oil bearing sands. Later Atwater’s attention turned to problems of long-term human presence in space, working on regenerable systems for water and air purification, and means for decomposition and stabilization of solid waste materials and recovery of useful resources therefrom. [...] During these years Atwater and colleagues also developed novel sensors and analytical instrumentation for monitoring and control of life support systems. [...] In addition to instrumentation and methods, much of this work entailed the development of novel materials and the characterization of material properties, particularly with respect to magnetic and broadband microwave dielectric phenomena. [...] Recent research includes the study of multiphase immiscible fluid flow in porous media, and the recovery of hydrogen from methane (natural gas) using magnetically stabilized fluidized bed and microwave plasma reactors. Though in retirement, Atwater continues his association with former colleagues, providing theoretical analysis of experimental data, and preparation of materials for publication.|$|E

The depth match interval of − 4  m between the drilling mud logging data and the <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> data must be taken into account.

In two ODP sites (863 B and 1109 D), MLP's predictions are compared to conventional 'mixing' methods.

TITLE: GEOPHYSICAL STUDIES OF THE HERALD-PHILLIPSTOWN FAULT AND OTHER SHALLOW STRUCTURES NEAR CARMI, ILLINOIS. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr John L. Sexton 	Four seismic reflection profiles from the Wabash Valley area of southeastern Illinois successfully imaged the Herald-Phillipstown fault. From the reflection profiles and <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs,</b> it was interpreted that the Herald-Phillipstown fault is an inverted flower structure. The main {{fault of the}} group is a steeply dipping normal fault with associated splay faults that are reverse in character. All the faults of this inverted flower structure are basement penetrating. Structural contour maps as well as maps of various reflector surfaces are prepared using two way travel {{time as well as}} depth. These maps show that the reflectors are undulating in character. Also distinct east-west rotational movements of the reflectors are observed along these faults and the main fault shows a curved geometry from south to north. The combination of the rotational movement, the curved nature of the fault plane and the undulating reflectors resulted in variation of offsets along these faults. The nature of faults of the inverted flower structure as observed on the seismic reflection profiles also indicates {{that there has been a}} change in the stress regime from extensional to compressional. Structural cross sections were generated using <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> from drill holes located along these seismic lines to analyze the nature of these faults at shallower depths.

Compared to the Longmaxi shale, the Lower Cambrian Niutitang shale, which has a greater deposition thickness and wider distribution area, is another significant stratum for China's shale gas. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> {{is one of the}} most significant methods used for identification and evaluation of shale gas reservoirs throughout the process of shale gas exploration and development. In this paper, the logging response of the Niutitang shale is summarized to “four high and four low”, this was determined through a comparative analysis of three shale gas wells in the Cen'gong block. The Geochemical logging (GEM) data shows that as the depth goes deeper the content of Si (quartz) increases and the content of Al, Fe, K (Potassium), and Clay minerals decreases. In addition, the Niutitang shale mainly has the feature of a single peak or two continuous peaks in T 2 spectrum on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging response. This has a longer T 2 time and greater amplitude than normal shales. The logging response of various lithology and preservation is summarized by overlapping and a cross-plot analysis with the spectral gamma-ray, resistivity, density, acoustic, and compensated neutron logging data, which are sensitive to organic-rich shales. Moreover, the resistivity and acoustic logging data are sensitive to gas content, fluid properties, and preservation conditions, which can be used as indicators of shale gas content and preservation...|$|E
40|$|We combine <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> {{and passive}} seismic {{measurements}} {{to characterize the}} near-surface geology of an area located in Hontomin, Burgos (Spain). This area has some near-surface challenges for a geophysical study. The irregular topography is characterized by limestone outcrops and unconsolidated sediments areas. Additionally, the near-surface geology includes an upper layer of pure limestones overlying marly limestones and marls (Upper Cretaceous). These materials lie on top of Low Cretaceous siliciclastic sediments (sandstones, clays, gravels). In any case, a layer with reduced velocity is expected. The geophysical data sets {{used in this study}} include sonic and gamma-ray logs at two boreholes and passive seismic measurements: three arrays and 224 seismic stations for applying the horizontal-to-vertical amplitude spectra ratio method (H/V). Well-logging data define two significant changes in the P -wave-velocity log within the Upper Cretaceous layer and one more at the Upper to Lower Cretaceous contact. This technique has also been used for refining the geological interpretation. The passive seismic measurements provide a map of sediment thickness with a maximum of around 40  m and shear-wave velocity profiles from the array technique. A comparison between seismic velocity coming from well logging and array measurements defines the resolution limits of the passive seismic techniques and helps it to be interpreted.

These temperature anomalies are associated with groundwater circulation in fractures and faults distributed in the Cenozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary cover associated with and connected to fractures originating deep within the Paleozoic basement. The present study helps to understand the convective cell structure in order to optimize geothermal borehole trajectories. Methods: The work concentrated on a detailed interpretation of the geophysical and geological logs from Soultz geothermal wells mainly from the topographic surface to the Triassic formations, at between 800 -and 1, 400 -m depth above the deep granitic basement. Results: The analysis of drilling mud logging data and <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> data from the deep Soultz geothermal wells (GPK- 2, GPK- 3, GPK- 4) reveals the occurrence of nine fracture zones situated at depths greater than 900 m in the limestones of the Muschelkalk (Middle Trias) and the sandstones of the Buntsandstein (Lower Trias). Based on indications of total or partial mud losses, these fracture zones have been classified as permeable or impermeable. Conclusions: Permeable fractures between circa 900 -m depth and 1, 400 -m depth are connected to a large-scale fault and control the top of the convective cells. There is no indication of permeability in the formations above the Keuper layer, and the uppermost part of the sedimentary cover acts as a cap rock, insulating the convective regime in the Triassic sediments and the granitic basement...|$|E

In this study, cluster analysis is applied to <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> to identify hydraulically significant fractures. Cluster analysis is a multivariate technique for the simultaneous analysis of several <b>geophysical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> over a wide depth range. In this study, 16 " normal resistivity, natural gamma, and tube-wave amplitude logs from the Maynardville Limestone on the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee, were examined. The logs show decreases in both 16 " normal resistivity and sonic tube-wave amplitude near fractures. The natural gamma log identifies clay-rich zones that exhibit geophysical response similar to fractures {{and can be used}} to discriminate these zones from fractures. Second derivatives of the resistivity log and tube-wave amplitude log were calculated prior to cluster analysis in order to enhance anomalous response attributed to fractures and suppress long wavelength responses caused by changes in lithology and water chemistry. Clusters associated with fractures are characterized by a high 16 " normal resistivity second derivative, a high second derivative of the tube-wave amplitude, and low natural gamma radiation. The cluster analysis results were calibrated by comparing cluster distribution to the distribution of fractures that had be 5 h previously identified by core analysis and drilling records in two wells. The calibration was verified by successfully identifying fractures in a third corehole using the characteristics of the fracture clusters from the other wells. The cluster analysis method used in this study is capable of distinguishing wide-aperture fractures or small cavities from other smaller fractures. This method provides a quick and simple way of locating fractures in the vicinity of a borehole, particularly where core or other data are not available, and this technique adds to a growing number of log interpretation techniques for hydrogeologic investigations.
