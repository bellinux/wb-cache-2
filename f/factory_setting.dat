50|$|Topps {{remains the}} only {{baseball}} card company today to still offer <b>factory</b> <b>sets</b> of their base brand. Their first <b>factory</b> <b>set</b> was offered in 1974 exclusively in the J.C. Penney catalog, but Topps would not begin releasing <b>factory</b> <b>sets</b> again until 1982. The 1982 Topps <b>Factory</b> <b>Set</b> is rare due to J.C. Penney's failure to sell them. J.C. Penney <b>factory</b> <b>sets</b> were available in 1982 in a color box and 1983 (SKU 672-1203), 1984 (SKU 672-1641), and 1985 (SKU 672-2029) in brown boxes. From 1986-1992, Topps <b>factory</b> <b>sets</b> came in two designs, Retail (or Christmas) and Hobby dealer. Retail <b>factory</b> <b>sets</b> were in very colorful boxes and were typically released near Christmas time (and for that reason are sometimes called Christmas sets). Hobby dealer sets were in much plainer boxes until 1993. Topps {{continues to this day}} to offer not only retail, hobby, and Christmas sets, but also team themed <b>factory</b> <b>sets</b> (starting in 2004) with bonus cards exclusive to each one.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} to support the argument that women receive such perceived traits or skills in a non-formal and independent setting. [...] However, as a result of which, women's skills employed in a <b>factory</b> <b>setting</b> are likely to be viewed as less valuable compared to other skill sets. Thus, women can be described as being relegated to an inferior status because their abilities are not equally valued. Finally, while women in factory settings are often unfairly demoted and forced into submissive roles, they are aware of their perceived lower status and do not accept it.|$|E
50|$|Setback is the {{difference}} between right side and left side wheelbase length. It can also be measured as an angle. Setback less than the manufacturer specified tolerance (for example about 6mm) does not affect car handling. That's because, when the vehicle is turning, one wheel is ahead of the other by several centimetres and therefore the setback is negligible. There are even some car models with different <b>factory</b> <b>setting</b> for right and left side wheelbase length, for various design reasons. An off-spec setback may occur because of a collision or a difference between right and left caster.|$|E
