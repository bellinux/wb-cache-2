2500|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{acclaimed}} {{performance at the}} World Cup and the praise earned, Klinsmann declined to renew his contract, informing the German Football Association (DFB) of his decision on 11 July 2006. The decision was officially announced by the DFB on 12 July 2006. Klinsmann's assistant, Joachim Löw, was appointed as the new head coach at the same press conference. Klinsmann said, [...] "My big wish is to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> family, {{to go back to}} leading a normal life with them... After two years of putting in a lot of energy, I feel I lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the rock–dance sound which {{dominated}} {{her previous}} album Simply Deep, Rowland {{felt she was}} still struggling with finding her sound as solo artist, and instead of capitalizing off its international success, the singer and her management settled on [...] "a more urban approach" [...] with her second album. Commenting on her decision, Rowland later told MTV News, [...] "in general, I'm going in the urban, more R route. Of course, that's what I started with Destiny's Child, [...] my first solo album I did more of a pop-sounding record. So I wanted to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> roots and dibble and dabble with some beats." [...] Consequently, Columbia Records consulted {{a wider range of}} contemporary R and hip hop producers and artists such as Big Tank, Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith, Rockwilder, Rich Harrison, Rodney Jerkins, and Robin Thicke to work with Rowland on the album. Female rappers Remy Ma, Eve, and Shawnna also lent their voices to guest parts.|$|E
2500|$|Norris {{said the}} {{campaign}} had grown {{much bigger than}} she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. [...] "I just want to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at The Washington Post. Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was {{dropping out of the}} movement. [...] "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," [...] he wrote. [...] "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out." [...] Norris acknowledged, [...] "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid." [...] On April 29, Norris suggested that [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] be called off: [...] "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights." [...] On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.|$|E

I {{could not tell}} why God had called me nor what I had to do." ...|$|R
