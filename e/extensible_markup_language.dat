25|$|Context-free grammars {{arise in}} {{linguistics}} {{where they are}} used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a natural language, and they were in fact invented by the linguist Noam Chomsky for this purpose, but have not really lived up to their original expectation. By contrast, in computer science, as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of programming languages. In a newer application, they are used in {{an essential part of the}} <b>Extensible</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XML) called the Document Type Definition.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{parentheses}} is Lisp's most immediately obvious {{difference from}} other programming language families. As a result, students have long given Lisp nicknames such as Lost In Stupid Parentheses, or Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses. However, the S-expression syntax is {{also responsible for}} much of Lisp's power: the syntax is extremely regular, which facilitates manipulation by computer. However, the syntax of Lisp {{is not limited to}} traditional parentheses notation. It can be extended to include alternative notations. For example, XMLisp is a Common Lisp extension that employs the metaobject protocol to integrate S-expressions with the <b>Extensible</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XML).|$|E
500|$|Papers are indexed {{within the}} {{database}} by their bibliographic record, containing {{the details of}} the journal they were published in and various associated metadata, such as author lists, references and citations. [...] Originally this data was stored in ASCII format, but eventually the limitations of this encouraged the database maintainers to migrate all records to an XML (<b>Extensible</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language)</b> format in 2000. [...] Bibliographic records are now stored as an XML element, with sub-elements for the various metadata.|$|E

But recently, clusters of commodity computers (PCs, Macintoshes, low cost workstations) {{have become a}} practical alternative.

2500|$|XML (<b>Extensible</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language)</b> is a meta markup {{language}} that is now widely used. XML {{was developed by the}} World Wide Web Consortium, in a committee created and chaired by Jon Bosak. The main purpose of XML was to simplify SGML by focusing on a particular problem—documents on the Internet. XML remains a meta-language like SGML, allowing users to create any tags needed (hence [...] "extensible") and then describing those tags and their permitted uses.|$|E

Silverlight makes it possible to dynamically load <b>Extensible</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XML) content that can be manipulated through a Document Object Model (DOM) interface, a technique that is consistent with conventional Ajax techniques. Silverlight exposes a Downloader object which can be used to download content, like scripts, media assets, or other data, as may be required by the application. With version 2, the programming logic can be written in any [...]NET language, including some derivatives of common dynamic programming languages like IronRuby and IronPython.|$|E
