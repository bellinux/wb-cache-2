Also, the metal grain size has influence; the smaller grains, the more grain boundaries {{and the higher}} likelihood of electromigration effects. However, if you reduce wire width to below the average grain size of the wire material, grain boundaries become [...] "crosswise", more or less perpendicular {{to the length of}} the wire. The resulting structure resembles the joints in a stalk of bamboo. With such a structure, the resistance to electromigration increases, despite an increase in current density.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify earlier work on journal {{diffusion}} metrics. Classical journal indicators such as the Garfield impact factor do not measure the breadth of influence across the literature of a particular journal title. As a new approach to measuring research influence, the study complements these existing metrics with a series of formally described <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Using a publication‐citation matrix as an organising construct, the paper develops formal descriptions of two forms of diffusion metric: “relative diffusion factors” and “journal diffusion factors” in both their synchronous and diachronous forms. It also provides worked examples for selected library and information science and economics journals, plus a sample of health information papers to illustrate their construction and use. Findings – <b>Diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> capture different aspects of the citation reception process than existing bibliometric measures. The paper shows that <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> can be applied at the whole journal level or for sets of articles and that they provide a richer evidence base for citation analyses than traditional measures alone. Research limitations/implications – The focus of this paper is on clarifying the concepts underlying <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> and there is unlimited scope for further work to apply these metrics to much larger and more comprehensive data sets than has been attempted here. Practical implications – These new tools extend the range of tools available for bibliometric, and possibly webometric, analysis. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> might find particular application in studies where the research questions focus on the dynamic aspects of innovation and knowledge transfer. Originality/value – This paper will be of interest to those with theoretical interests in informetric distributions as well as those interested in science policy and innovation studies. 10550...|$|R

Comparisons of the overall performance, radial distributions of performance parameters, <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> at the near-stall conditions, blade element data, and the axial distribution of rotor tip static pressures yielded the following results: (1) higher peak pressure ratio, high stage and rotor efficiencies, and greater stall margin were obtained with the lower aspect ratio blading, (2) the lower aspect ratio blading showed improved performance over the entire blade span, and (3) the lower aspect ratio rotors operated at higher <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> and higher incidence angles over the entire blade span...|$|R

40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism to}} explain how animals got their coat patterns was proposed by Alan Turing. He assumed that two kinds of morphogens diffuse on a surface and interact with each other, generating a reaction-diffusion mechanism. We developed a new framework for pattern generation incorporating a non-diffusing transcription factor in the system. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> (one inhibitor and one activator) acting on cell surface receptors modulate the activity of a transcription factor. The difference in the local concentration of <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> is translated into the degree of activation of transcription factors. The speed of this process determines then pattern formation velocity, i. e. the elapsed time from an initial noisy situation to a final developed pattern. If the pattern formation velocity slows down compared {{to the growth of}} the surface, the phenomenon of "growing surface interference" occurs. We find that this phenomenon might explain the rosette pattern observed on different types of felids and the pale stripes found between the regular black stripes of zebras. We also investigate the dynamics between pattern formation velocity and growth and to what extent a pattern may freeze on growing domains...|$|R

The measured minimum-loss coefficient was 0. 35, and this value falls above a previous correlation of rotor losses with <b>diffusion</b> <b>factor.</b> Through a comparison with data for three other rotors, the occurrence of high losses was related to a high suction-surface Mach number.

This rotor used a design tip <b>diffusion</b> <b>factor</b> of 0. 20 with a design corrected specific weight flow of 40 pounds per second per square foot of frontal area, a total-pressure ratio of 1. 27, and an adiabatic efficiency of 0. 96. The design, rotor performance, and blade element performance are presented with a discussion on rotor shock losses and a comparison with a similarly designed rotor with a tip <b>diffusion</b> <b>factor</b> of 0. 35. At the design corrected tip speed of 1100 feet per second, a peak rotor adiabatic efficiency of 0. 88 was attained at a corrected specific weight flow of 39 pounds per second per square foot of frontal area with a mass-averaged total-pressure ratio of 1. 27. The blade element tip <b>diffusion</b> <b>factor</b> was 0. 281, which is 0. 08 higher than the design value of 0. 20. Peak efficiencies of 0. 95, 0. 91, 0. 89, and 0. 85 were obtained at 70, 80, 90, and 110 percent of design speed, respectively. Comparison of the performance of the rotor reported herein and a similarly designed rotor with increased blade loading indicates that higher blade loading results in a more desirable rotor because of a higher pressure ratio and equivalent efficiency.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to improve the {{understanding}} of the thermal diffusion process on a microscopic scale by studying the mass effect on thermal <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors.</b> To achieve such a goal, Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations are performed on binary mixtures of simple Lennard-Jones spheres for a large range of thermodynamic states. Mixtures for which only the mass between species differs, up to mass ratios of 50, are analyzed (isotope like mixtures). In equimolar mixtures, it is shown that the link between the thermal <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> and the ratio between the difference in masses and the sum of masses holds approximately for all states studied. In addition, it is found that this link strongly depends on density but weakly on temperature. In nonequimolar mixtures, results indicate that the effect of mass ratio between species depends on the molar fraction. Using the data computed, a simple density dependent correlation is proposed to quantify the mass effect in Lennard-Jones binary mixtures. Finally, it is shown that, taking into account only the mass effect, this correlation is able to provide a reasonable estimation of thermodiffusion in n-pentane/ndecane mixtures which underlines intrinsic weakness of some of the usual thermodynamic models predicting thermodiffusio...|$|R

40|$|Fuselage-embedded {{engines in}} future {{aircraft}} will see increased flow distortions {{due to the}} ingestion of airframe boundary layers. This reduces the required propulsive power compared to podded engines. Inlet flow distortions mean that localized regions of flow within the fan and first stage compressor are operating at off-design conditions. It is important to weigh the benefit of increased vehicle propulsive efficiency against the resultant reduction in engine efficiency. High computational cost has limited most past research to single distortion studies. The objective of this thesis is to extract scaling laws for transonic compressor performance {{in the presence of}} various distortion patterns and intensities. The machine studied is the NASA R 67 transonic compressor. Volumetric source terms are used to model rotor and stator blade rows. The modelling approach is an innovative combination of existing flow turning and loss models, combined with a compressible flow correction. This approach allows for a steady calculation to capture distortion transfer; as a result, the computational cost is reduced by two orders of magnitude. At peak efficiency, the rotor work coefficient and isentropic efficiency are matched within 1. 4 % of previously published experimental results. A key finding of this thesis is that, in non-uniform flow, the state-of-the-art loss model employed is unable to capture the impact of variations in local flow coefficient, limiting the analysis of local entropy generation. New insight explains the mechanism governing the interaction between a total temperature distortion and a compressor rotor. A parametric study comprising 16 inlet distortions reveals that for total temperature distortions, upstream flow redistribution and rotor <b>diffusion</b> <b>factor</b> changes are shown to scale linearly with distortion severity. Linear <b>diffusion</b> <b>factor</b> scaling does not hold true for total pressure distortions.

This cross transport process, also called Soret effect, couples mass flux and thermal gradient and is still largely misunderstood. For this study, we have applied a boundary driven non-equilibrium molecular dynamics algorithm on Lennard-Jones spheres mixtures. Simulations have been performed at a constant reduced supercritical state, using a van der Waals' one fluid approximation in order to fulfil the law of the corresponding states.

40|$|In the Jülich Nuclear Research Center, field {{experiments}} on the atmospheric dispersion of plumes by turbulent diffusion {{have been carried}} out in order to measure the diffusion parameters required for environmental exposure calculations. For that purpose, test aerosols, tracered with Cu 64, have been released under different weather conditions from the 50 m and 100 m platforms of a meteorological tower, and the ground level concentration distribution below the plume has been measured up to a source distance of 10 km with a grid of 100 sampling stations. The results of more than 40 experiments show that, compared with the predictions based on Pasquill's system, the source distance of the ground level concentration maximum is reduced by a factor of 2 to 5, depending on the diffusion category. This discrepancy can be explained by differences in the surface roughness, which is not taken into account in the determination of the diffusion category by systems based on synoptic meteorological observations. A neglection of the increased mechanical turbulence over rough terrain results in an underestimation of the environmental exposure for small source distances and an overestimation for larger distances In order to enable the application of the results of diffusion experiments to other sites, it is necess~ry to determine the diffusiori categories on the basis of meteorological parameters directly correlated with the local turbulence and, hence, with the surface roughness of the terrain. The measured diffusion parameters have been used to calculate the short-time <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors</b> for the various exposure pathways. The long-time <b>diffusion</b> <b>factors,</b> representing the annual concentration distributions in the different sectors of the windrose, have been computed by superposition of the short-time concentrations according to the 3 -dimensional frequency distribution of wind direction, wind velocity and diffusion category, which have been measured in Jülich for more than five years.
