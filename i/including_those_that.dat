5|$|The {{economic}} {{costs of the}} war were high {{in some of the}} southern English colonies, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections.

5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> had been in rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, {{as a part of}} the Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E

Throughout the day Viet Cong reconnaissance parties, perhaps <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> had been contacted intermittently, had observed the approaching Australian force on a line leading directly to the U1 headquarters. During the fighting the Viet Cong company commander—Nguyen Van Bao—had split his force into two, allocating one platoon to fight the advancing Australians, and the other two to protect the headquarters. Following the Australian withdrawal Van Bao had also withdrawn, pre-empting the ensuing barrage, yet the U1 base remained in communist hands.|$|E
5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} {{this period of}} Antarctic interest is what historian H. R. Mill called 'the age of averted interest'. Following the expedition South by the ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested {{that there were no}} scientific discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South. It is considered that Ross' influence, as well as the loss of the Franklin expedition in the Arctic, led to disinterest in polar inquiry, particularly by The Royal Society: the British-founded organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there is a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.|$|E

5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, gardens became {{focused on}} the plant conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was {{established}} by the IUCN, and the World Conservation Union in 1987 {{with the aim of}} coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species.|$|E
5|$|Like the Philadelphia {{extension}}, {{the western}} extension required {{the building of}} long bridges, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> cross the Beaver River and the Allegheny River. The overpasses along the road consisted of steel girder bridges and through plate girder bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for overpasses, although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local rural roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a notable}} but {{variable}} trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain. The brains of horseshoe crabs {{include all the}} ganglia of the prosoma plus those {{of the first two}} opisthosomal segments, while the other opisthosomal segments retain separate pairs of ganglia. In most living arachnids, except scorpions if they are true arachnids, all the ganglia, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma. However, in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders, the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused, and in scorpions the ganglia of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia.|$|E
5|$|Weymouth's esplanade is {{composed}} of Georgian terraces, which have been converted into apartments, shops, hotels and guest houses. The buildings were constructed in the Georgian and Regency periods between 1770 and 1855, designed by architects such as James Hamilton, and were commissioned by wealthy businessmen, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> {{were involved in the}} growth of Bath. These terraces form a long, continuous arc of buildings which face Weymouth Bay along the esplanade. The earliest purpose-built hotel there was the first incarnation of the Royal Hotel. The esplanade features the multi-coloured Jubilee Clock, erected in 1887 to mark the 50th year of Queen Victoria's reign. Statues of Victoria, George III and Sir Henry Edwards, Member of Parliament for the borough from 1867 to 1885, and two war memorials stand along the Esplanade.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ending}} of the Gupta Dynasty in {{northern}} India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.|$|E
