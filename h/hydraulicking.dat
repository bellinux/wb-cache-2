2500|$|Hydraulic mining, or <b>hydraulicking,</b> {{is a form}} {{of mining}} that uses {{high-pressure}} jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. [...] In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, much of Hobson Creek and the Clearwater River above Hobson Lake {{had been}} staked and active mining or <b>hydraulicking</b> was underway. The Blue Ice Mine on Fred Wells Creek, {{a branch of}} Hobson Creek, was a unique endeavour. The name aptly {{described}} the site, located {{at an altitude of}} , just [...] away from an active glacier. Although showings of gold and silver were of an economical quantity during a 1938 survey, the site was never fully developed, because of the unpredictable movements of the nearby glacier.|$|E

50|$|The creek {{has been}} mined for gold and silver, which {{occurred}} simultaneously and were unusual {{to find in}} that way. It has been <b>hydraulicked</b> and mined by Chinese syndicates like Gow Sing and Co. The bulk of the gold was obtained on bedrock and in crevices and cracks.|$|R
50|$|Antler Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Cariboo region of British Columbia. The creek was {{discovered}} in 1860 by John Rose. The creek was mined and at one time produced $10,000 per day.

2500|$|Water {{was used}} {{on a large scale}} by Roman {{engineers}} in the first centuries BC and AD when the Roman empire was expanding rapidly in Europe. Using a process later known as hushing, the Romans stored a large volume of water in a reservoir immediately above the area to be mined; the water was then quickly released. [...] The resulting wave of water removed overburden and exposed bedrock. [...] Gold veins in the bedrock were then worked using a number of techniques, and water power was used again to remove debris. [...] The remains at Las Médulas and in surrounding areas show badland scenery on a gigantic scale owing to <b>hydraulicking</b> of the rich alluvial gold deposits. Las Médulas is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The site shows the remains of at least seven large aqueducts of up to [...] in length feeding large supplies of water into the site. The gold-mining operations were described in vivid terms by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia published in the first century AD. Pliny was a procurator in Hispania Terraconensis in the 70s AD and must have witnessed for himself the operations. The use of hushing has been confirmed by field survey and archaeology at Dolaucothi in South Wales, the only known Roman gold mine in Britain.|$|E

50|$|O'Donnel River is a river {{located in}} the Atlin Country region of British Columbia. This river flows into {{the east side of}} Atlin Lake about 14 mi south of the town of Atlin. The river is about 30 mi long. The river was {{discovered}} in 1898 and was originally known as Moose River or Caribou River. In 1912 a rich gold streak was discovered in the river, which attracted many miners. The river has been sluiced, drifted, and <b>hydraulicked.</b>|$|R
60|$|Both of us {{came to the}} {{conviction}} that the 'Izrah Concession' will pay, and pay well. But instead of the routine shafting and tunnelling it must be treated by <b>hydraulicking</b> and washing away the thirty feet of auriferous soil, whose depth covers the reef. The bed of the Fía will supply the water, and a force-pump, worked by men, or preferably by steam-power. Thus we shall keep the mine dry: otherwise it will be constantly flooded. Moreover, the land seems to be built for ditching and sluicing, and the trenches will want only a plank-box with a metal grating at the head. I can only hope that the operations will be conducted by an expert hand who knows something of the Californian or the Australian diggings.|$|E
60|$|And, lastly, the sluice begat the jet, or <b>hydraulicking</b> proper, {{which is}} at present the highest effort of placer-mining. We thus reverse the {{primitive}} process which carried the wash-dirt to the water; we now carry the water to the wash-dirt. In California I found the miners washing down loose sandstones and hillocks of clay, passing the stuff through sluices, and making money when the gold averaged only 9d. and even 4d. to the ton. A man could work under favourable circumstances twenty to thirty tons a day. An Australian company, mentioned by Mr. R. Brough Smyth, with 200 inches of water, directed by ten hands, 'hydraulicked' in six days 224,000 cubic feet of dirt. The results greatly vary; in some places a man will remove 200 cubic yards a day, and in others only 50.|$|E
60|$|From Ingotro we marched back to Nánwá {{and took}} leave of Chief Apó; his parting words were a request that work might be begun {{as soon as}} possible, and that at any rate his {{concession}} should be properly marked out. The limitation must not be neglected, but the exploitation of the diggings is another affair. The ground is exceptionally rich in gold, and it offers every facility for extracting the metal. But the climate of the lowlands presents difficulties. In so large an area of broken ground, however, there are eminences that command a prospect {{of the sea and}} which are within the influence of the sea-breeze. The conditions will, doubtless, improve when the adjacent mining-grounds, Inyoko and Izrah, shall have been opened and the country cleared and ventilated. In the meantime light works and <b>hydraulicking</b> on an extensive scale might be begun at once, especially during the rainy season, under seasoned and acclimatised overseers. An amelioration must be the result, and even before the rich surface has been washed {{it will be possible to}} set up heavy machinery for deep working, shafting, and tunnelling.|$|E
50|$|Granite Creek is a {{creek and}} {{townsite}} in British Columbia {{located in the}} Similkameen region. Granite Creek flows north into the Tulameen River and joins that river approximately {{one and a half}} miles to the east of Coalmont, British Columbia. It is assumed Granite Creek yielded more than $500,000 in placer gold since its discovery. Gold nuggets worth $50 in value were not unusual in the early years. The creek was mined by Europeans and Chinese. Granite Creek was <b>hydraulicked</b> near its mouth in the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|McKee Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Atlin Country region of British Columbia. The creek flows into Atlin Lake from the east side. It is located 8 miles south of Atlin Town and is 7 miles in length. McKee Creek was first {{discovered}} in 1898, and since then has been hand-mined and <b>hydraulicked.</b> Outfits such as Atlin Mining Company have worked the creek, with the largest nugget recovered from the creek weighing just over 28 ounces. McKee Creek was a consistent mining producer well into the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Boulder Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Atlin Country region of British Columbia. The creek flows into Lake Surprise from the north side just west of Ruby Creek. Boulder Creek was {{discovered}} in 1898. The creek had rich mining content for one mile of its length. Of all Atlin Placer Creeks, Boulder ranks third in total production. Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company have worked the creek. The creek has been <b>hydraulicked.</b> The largest nugget recovered from the creek weighed just over 19 ounces and was found in 1899.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{exploration}} and mining work {{was carried out}} by means of drift diggings, followed by ground sluicing and <b>hydraulicking</b> later. Drift mining and <b>hydraulicking</b> were both abandoned in the 1930s as there were no dumping facilities for mining waste. Later exploration to bedrock in pursuit of hard-rock ores met with little success.|$|E
50|$|Dragon Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Cariboo region of British Columbia. The creek was {{discovered}} in the 1860s by a Frenchman nicknamed The Dragon because of his fighting abilities. The creek has been mined using drifting, sluicing, <b>hydraulicking</b> and drilling.|$|E
50|$|Lardeau Creek is a creek {{located in}} the West Kootenay region of British Columbia. The creek flows into the head of Trout Lake. Gold was {{discovered}} prior to 1900. Lardeau Creek has been mined since its discovery. The creek has been mined using several methods, including <b>hydraulicking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pine Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Atlin Country region of British Columbia. Pine Creek flows out of Lake Surprise and empties into Atlin Lake {{just south of the}} town of Atlin. The creek is 12 miles in length. The gold bearing section is 2 miles long. This creek was staked in 1898 by Fritz Miller and Kenneth McLaren. By 1899, 3,000 prospectors stood on the banks of this creek. The largest nugget found weighed just over 48 ounces and was {{discovered}} in 1925. The creek has been worked with rockers, waterwheels, sluices and <b>hydraulicked.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thibert Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Cassiar Country region of British Columbia. The is creek flows into Dease Lake at the north end. Thibert Creek lies {{on the western side}} of Dease Lake. The creek was {{explored}} in April, 1873 by Henry Thibert and several French Canadians. Thibert was the first placer gold creek discovered in Cassiar. The creek was mined for gold. The official returns from the gold between the years 1874 and 1895 were $1,279,600. The creek was hand mined by Europeans and Chinese. By 1880 the Chinese owned the majority of claims on the creek as gold on the creek started to dwindle. Only a dozen miners worked the creek by 1895. The creek was later <b>hydraulicked.</b>|$|R
50|$|Birch Creek is a creek {{located in}} the Atlin Country region of British Columbia. Birch Creek flows {{parallel}} to Boulder Creek and Ruby Creek. The creek is located west of Lake Surprise. Birch Creek flows into Pine Creek and was discovered in 1898. The greatest mining activity took place between 1902 {{and the start of}} the First World War. Some mining activity also occurred during the 1930s. The Dominion Trust Company <b>hydraulicked</b> Birch Creek in the 1930s. The largest pure gold nugget in the district was recovered from this creek in 1913. The nugget was 73 ounces. In the Gold Boom years the Creek was largely ignored as the depth of bed rock discouraged hand mining operations. When gold in other creeks in the vicinity were exhausted, attention was turned to Birch.|$|R
50|$|The {{containing}} material {{may be too}} loose {{to safely}} mine by tunnelling, though it is possible where the ground is permanently frozen.

50|$|The {{river bed}} has very low slopes which retards the flow; the slope is {{generally}} {{in the range}} of 5 ft to 1 mi, except in its headwater reach of the river. This feature did not permit diversion of river water for mining to adopt <b>hydraulicking</b> procedure, particularly when the Alaska gold mining was at its peak. Hence, the Candle-Alaska Hydraulic Gold Mining Company excavated a ditch (an unlined canal), in 1907, to collect water from Glacier and Dome creeks, and to convey it to a location near Candle to facilitate mining the gold-bearing gravels of Candle Creek. To cater {{to the needs of the}} low flow season, when the streams (Quartz and Hunter creek to Candle Creek) carried low flows, an additional canal was constructed during the summers of 1908 and 1909 to facilitate the <b>hydraulicking</b> process of mining. The ditches were of substantial length, measuring 60 mi of canals and an additional 14000 ft of pipe line to a point about 303 ft above the mouth of Candle Creek.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{specific}} gravity of tin dioxide, about 80% of mined tin is from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary lodes. Tin is often recovered from granules washed downstream {{in the past and}} deposited in valleys or the sea. The most economical ways of mining tin are by dredging, <b>hydraulicking,</b> or open pits. Most of the world's tin is produced from placer deposits, which can contain as little as 0.015% tin.|$|E
