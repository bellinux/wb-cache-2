In frequency 1000 Hertz, it achieves to 0. 9 in sound absorption coefficient that approaches to a perfect value (1. 0). ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries generate millions {{of tons of}} agricultural wastes and forest residues every year. Handling and transportation of these materials which is difficult due to their low bulk density can easily be address through briquette production. Briquette quality which is greatly influence by its bulk density, calorific value and resistance to humidity is very important when deciding the materials and the particle size that will produce briquette of good quality. This research work centers on the assessment of particle size and biomass type that will give good bulk density and resistance to humidity. Three type of biomass materials with various particle sizes were selected viz: maize stalk (0. 6, 1. 0, 2. 36, 4. 75, 8. 0, 9. 5 and 12. 5 mm), rice husks (0. 6, 1. 0, and 2. 36 mm), and sawdust(0. 6, 1. 0, 2. 36, 4. 75, 8. 0, 9. 5 and 12. 5 mm). The bulk density and resistance to humidity was determined and it was discovered that rice <b>husks</b> briquette with <b>particle</b> size 0. 6 mm and 3 % starch content have the best bulk density while maize briquette with particle size 4. 75 mm and 9 % starch content give the best result for resistance to humidity therefore, for the purpose of packaging and transportation rice husks briquettes of size 0. 6 mm and 3 % starch is recommended while for resistance to humidity, 4. 75 mm, 9 % starch content of maize stalk briquette is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{of biomass}} {{gasification}} {{has been an}} active area of research for past two decades. In the published literature, three approaches have been adopted for the modeling of this process, viz. thermodynamic equilibrium, semi-equilibrium and kinetic. In this paper, we have attempted to present a comparative assessment of these three types of models for predicting outcome of the gasification process in a circulating fluidized bed gasifier. Two model biomass, viz. rice <b>husk</b> and wood <b>particles,</b> have been chosen for analysis, with gasification medium being air. Although the trends in molar composition, net yield and LHV of the producer gas predicted by three models are in concurrence, significant quantitative difference {{is seen in the}} results. Due to rather slow kinetics of char gasification and tar oxidation, carbon conversion achieved in single pass of biomass through the gasifier, calculated using kinetic model, is quite low, which adversely affects the yield and LHV of the producer gas. Although equilibrium and semi-equilibrium models reveal relative insensitivity of producer gas characteristics towards temperature, the kinetic model shows significant effect of temperature on LHV of the gas at low air ratios. Kinetic models also reveal volume of the gasifier to be an insignificant parameter, as the net yield and LHV of the gas resulting from 6 m and 10 m riser is same. On a whole, the analysis presented in this paper indicates that thermodynamic models are useful tools for quantitative assessment of the gasification process, while kinetic models provide physically more realistic picture...|$|R
40|$|Rice husk {{and straw}} are {{by-products}} of rice cultivation and processing industry {{and can be}} used as an energy source. Proper understanding of the physical properties of rice residues is necessary for utilizing them in thermochemical conversion processes such as gasification and combustion. The physical properties (moisture content, particle size, bulk density and porosity) of rice husks and straws obtained from three countries (Egypt, Cuba and China) were evaluated in this study. The moisture contents of rice husks and straws were in the ranges of 4. 60 - 6. 07 % and 6. 58 - 6. 92 %, respectively. For all rice varieties tested, the moisture content of the straws was higher than these of the <b>husks.</b> The <b>particle</b> sizes of rice husks and straws were in the ranges of 0. 212 - 0. 850 mm and 0 - 0. 710 mm, respectively. All the rice husk varieties had a normal distribution of particle size around the main value of 0. 6 mm while the particle size distribution for the rice straws showed a decreasing trend, the larger the particle size the higher was the weight percentage. The bulk density of rice husks and straws were in the ranges of 331. 59 - 380. 54 kg m - 3 and 162. 03 - 194. 48 kg m - 3, respectively. The bulk density values of rice straws were lower than those of rice husks. A negative linear relationship between the bulk density and the average particle size was observed for rice husks and straws. The porosity of rice husks and straws were in the ranges of 63. 64 - 68. 94 % and 71. 21 - 85. 28 %, respectively. A positive linear relationship between the porosity and the average particle size was observed for rice husks and straws. Also, a negative linear relationship between the porosity and the bulk density was observed. The results obtained from this study showed significant differences in the physical properties of the rice husks and straws collected from different countries (located in three different continents). These differences may be due to variations in climatic conditions, soil type, methods of cultivation and type of fertilizer used. The results also indicated that different parts of rice plant (straw and husk) had different physical properties. Also, significant differences were observed among rice varieties even though they were grown under the same climatic conditions using same soil type and cultivation method {{as in the case of}} the long and short grain rice variety of Egypt...|$|R
