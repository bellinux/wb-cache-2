Dixon was initially unsure when the stylist picked out prints that clashed, as she knew she would never wear them in real life, but they worked for her character. The actress hoped that viewers would be able to relate to Tilly, especially as she does not make a big issue out {{of the fact that she}} is a lesbian. Dixon commented [...] "She's not defined by her sexuality, nobody is and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> shines through."
