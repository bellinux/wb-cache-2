5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of comb honey. Today, most honey is produced for extraction but comb honey remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with <b>extracted</b> <b>honey</b> to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing comb honey, which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> Because of the more demanding labor involved, comb honey has greater retail value than <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] Comb honey production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for comb honey production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of comb honey more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|E

5000|$|Radial baskets {{have the}} top {{bar of the}} frame facing {{outwards}} while tangential baskets have {{one side of the}} comb facing outward. Large commercial extractors are radial and rely on the upward slope of the comb cells. This slope allows to <b>extract</b> <b>honey</b> by applying centrifugal force toward the upper edge of the comb (opposite to the direction of gravity while in the hive). The amount of work during extraction is reduced in the radial type because the frames {{do not have to be}} turned over to <b>extract</b> the <b>honey</b> from the other side of the comb (however some extractors are capable of turning combs automatically).

Chemical control may results of residues in the <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> The presence of residues of p-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene in honey were investigated by means of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas-chromatography and mass-spectrometry (GC/MS). The method was linear between 5 ìg/kg and 200 ìg/kg of honey for p-dichlorobenzene and 1 ìg/kg and 200 ìg/kg of honey for naphthalene. Limits of detection were 1 ìg/kg and 0. 1 ìg/kg respectively. The relative standard deviations were 2. 59 % and 7. 92 % for p-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene respectively. Application of the method to 90 unifloral Greek honeys revealed that in 25. 6 % of the samples the concentration of either one of the pesticides overreached the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) value. Maximum concentrations were 163. 03 ìg/kg of honey for p-dichlorobenzene and 193. 74 ìg/kg of honey for naphthalene. Naphthalene was found in traceable amounts in 78. 9 % of the samples, but only 5. 6 % of them contained concentrations above the MRL value. This indicates the use of pre-contaminated honey comb foundations or built combs.

40|$|Abstract Background Keloid {{is a type}} of scar {{which extends}} beyond the {{boundaries}} of the original wound. It can spread to the surrounding skin by invasion. The use of Tualang honey is a possible approach for keloid treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the antiproliferative effect of methanolic extraction of Tualang honey to primary human keloid fibroblasts and to identify the volatile compounds in methanol extraction of Tualang honey. Methods Crude Tualang honey was extracted with methanol and then dried using rota vapor to remove remaining methanol from honey. Normal and keloid fibroblasts were verified and treated with the <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> Cell proliferation was tested with [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yi) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt] (MTS) assay. Extraction of Tualang honey using methanol was carried out and the extracted samples were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The result was analysed using SPSS and tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results Methanolic extraction of honey has positive anti proliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and octadecanoic acid may contribute to the anti-proliferative effect in keloid fibroblasts. Conclusions The methanolic honey extraction has an antiproliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts and a range of volatile compounds has been identified from Tualang honey. The antiproliferative effect of keloid fibroblasts towards Tualang honey may involve cell signaling pathway. Identifying other volatile compounds from different organic solvents should be carried out in future. </p...|$|E

In the laboratory, eggs, larvae, and adults of SHB were treated with thymol (10, 20, and 50  mg) or with organic acids: 85 % formic acid (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, and 2. 0  mL), 15 % lactic acid (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0  mL), oxalic acid (dihydrate crystals 35  g/L; 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, and 2. 0  mL), and 65 % acetic acid (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0  mL). Some of the chosen concentrations of formic and oxalic acid resulted in high mortalities of all SHB life stages. Therefore, they were further evaluated in the field utilising standard methods for control of V. destructor in Europe. After exposure to evaporating formic acid (85 %, Nassenheider®) and oxalic acid (2  g dehydrate crystals, Varrox®), mortality in all SHB tested stages did not increase significantly. The same was true for trials with 85 % (adults) or 60 % (eggs and larvae) formic acid, evaporating from sponge tissues in diagnostic trays.

40|$|In 2005 the IPMS project {{introduced}} a participatory market oriented value chain approach in Alaba and apiculture {{was identified as}} one of the priority marketable commodities. Amongst the problems and potentials identified in the apiculture value chain were lack of knowledge and skills to operate the modern beehives, low occupancy rate, lack of bee forage and a government controlled technology driven development approach. Furthermore, there was no marketing/processing system for the honey produced from the modern hives. Initial emphasis was given to build capacity and skills on different aspect of apiculture development with follow up and supervisory visits to targeted farmers in two PAs (Peasant associations). Those farmers also benefited from innovative credit channeled through the Menchone farmers’ Union, which enabled them to own more than three modern beehives per household. Linkages were also made with local carpenters for the construction and supply of modern and transitional hives. To alleviate bee forage problems, new forage were introduced in FTCs (Farmers Training Centers) and farmers’ fields. Finally colony splitting was introduced to increase the availability of productive colonies. The results of these interventions were measured both at district and household levels. Household survey data showed an average 26. 7 kg/modern hive/year in 2008. At district level, the number of farmers who now have modern hives (supplied under different programs) is 1783, which is 33 % of the estimated beekeeping households. Average annual gross production value of bee keepers with a combination of hive types averaged Birr 1, 500, as compared to Birr 500 for household who only had traditional hives. Data from 17 farmers which were more intensively supported, showed a significant higher productivity from modern hives (38 kg/hive) and their gross production value from different hive types averaged Birr 4, 600 /year. A cost benefit analysis based on the data obtained from 17 farmers indicated that benefits exceeded costs in year 2, which resulted in a cumulative net benefit of Birr 437 /hive over a 2 year period. The latter shows that apiculture can be a viable economic activity, once sufficient knowledge and skills are applied. Finally, {{as a result of the}} value chain approach, the number of partners involved in the development of the apiculture increased including private sector partners. However, while linkages were made with commercial processing factories in Nazareth, actual sale of clean honey through these outlets has not yet been materialized, since most honey is sold in the local market.
