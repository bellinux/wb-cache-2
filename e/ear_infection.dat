5|$|King Francis II died on 5 December 1560, of {{a middle}} <b>ear</b> <b>infection</b> that led to an abscess in his brain. Mary was grief-stricken. Her mother-in-law, Catherine de' Medici, became regent for the late king's ten-year-old brother Charles IX, who {{inherited}} the French throne. Mary returned to Scotland nine months later, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561. Having lived in France {{since the age of}} five, Mary had little direct experience of the dangerous and complex political situation in Scotland. As a devout Catholic, she was regarded with suspicion by many of her subjects, {{as well as by the}} Queen of England. Scotland was torn between Catholic and Protestant factions, and Mary's illegitimate half-brother, the Earl of Moray, was a leader of the Protestants. The Protestant reformer John Knox preached against Mary, condemning her for hearing Mass, dancing, and dressing too elaborately. She summoned him to her presence to remonstrate with him unsuccessfully, and later charged him with treason, but he was acquitted and released.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of some <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> in adults is difficult {{due to the}} low concentration of antimicrobial agent achievable in ear tissues especially when these are chronically inflamed; {{the high rate of}} resistance of some aetiologic agents to antibiotics compounds this problem.

25|$|Vertigo*, {{better known}} as {{vestibular}} disease* in dogs, is an uncommon condition in older dogs.

25|$|It is {{important}} to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for acute otitis media. As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one perforation, and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side <b>ear</b> <b>infection.</b> For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash.

25|$|Luther {{had been}} {{suffering}} from ill health for years, including Ménière's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract in one eye. From 1531 to 1546 his health deteriorated further. The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the scandal that ensued from the bigamy of the Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, all may have contributed. In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, arthritis, and an <b>ear</b> <b>infection</b> ruptured an ear drum. In December 1544, {{he began to feel}} the effects of angina.|$|E

40|$|Objective Language {{is almost}} always {{affected}} in fragile X syndrome (FXS), and a delay in language acquisition {{is one of the}} first characteristics. The aim of this work was to study the effect of recurrent middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> on the language profile in boys with FXS. Study design: Prospective case series. Setting Academic Medical Center. Subjects and Methods The present study was conducted on 30 males, ranging in age from 4 – 10 years. They were diagnosed as having a full mutation of DNA. The males were divided into two groups: Group A included 15 children with a history of recurrent middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> more than four times per year during the first 4 years of life, and Group B did not have a history of recurrent middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> during the first 4 years of life. Language assessments were done for all participants using the Standardized Arabic Language test. Results Results showed significant delays in language development in children with FXS. Relative strengths in semantics compared to syntax and pragmatics were observed in all boys. The recurrent <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> of the boys played an important role in the language development delay. The mean of receptive, expressive, and total language age was better and higher among boys without a history of recurrent middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> compared to boys with recurrent middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections.</b> Conclusion Recurrent otitis media in boys with FXS exacerbates the language problems that exist in this syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Hanson {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Burwood on 23 November 1913, the {{youngest}} of five children to Australian-born railroad engineer William Hanson, and his English-born wife Lilian, née Bennett. The marriage broke up when Hanson was quite young. Hanson was sickly as a child, suffering from bronchial complaints and a recurring <b>ear</b> <b>infection</b> that left him almost deaf in his left ear. He began experimenting in musical composition from the age of eight, inspired by his older sister's piano practice. Hanson's mother brought him up as a Baptist, and though he later left the faith he retained a lifelong interest in spirituality.|$|E
25|$|Most young {{children}} do not show any physical signs of FXS. It is not until puberty that physical features of FXS begin to develop. Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome may include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testes (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone. Recurrent otitis media (middle <b>ear</b> <b>infection)</b> and sinusitis is common during early childhood. Speech may be cluttered or nervous. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness, limited eye contact, memory problems, and difficulty with face encoding. Some individuals with fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{association}} between child care arrangements and repeated <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> in young children. METHODS. Data on 5818 children younger than 6 years of age were taken from the 1988 National Health Interview Survey of Child Health. RESULTS. Seventeen percent of the children had had repeated <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> in the year preceding the interview. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that factors significantly associated with repeated <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> were age (1 to 2 years), race (White), sex (male), and medical history (repeated tonsillitis, enlarged adenoids, or asthma). When these factors were controlled for, children in a current child care arrangement still had a 50 % higher chance of repeated <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> than did children not in care. Children in day care centers were at higher risk than children cared for in homes. Care in settings with more than six children elevated the risk, but hours per week of care did not. CONCLUSIONS. Decreasing the risk of repeated <b>ear</b> <b>infections</b> in young children in out-of-home child care settings may require smaller group sizes. Given the increasing use of child care, research should continue to identify specific aspects of child care that contribute to this problem...|$|R

Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsilitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both {{of which can be}} severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection — with blood in the urine).|$|E
25|$|The {{demonstration}} {{also led}} to a conflict with the Queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, {{in the autumn of}} 1790. That autumn, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent, which made him accuse her of having been manipulated by the oppositional of the female courtiers to participate in the political demonstration and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving: he suspected Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence, and the reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly for health reasons, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an <b>ear</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
