5|$|This {{behavior}} is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel, as described above. The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene (or cod) ligands are easily displaced.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E

5|$|Conductive CVD diamond <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical {{methods have}} been developed for covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, so it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but {{did not know the}} word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E

5|$|The wood of B.integrifolia is pink to red, with {{inconspicuous}} {{rings and}} conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33lb/ft3). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor load-bearing qualities, and {{is susceptible to}} termite attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental turnery, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> firewood.|$|E
5|$|VSWR and the {{positions}} of the nodes are parameters that can be directly measured with an instrument called a slotted line. This instrument makes use of the reflection phenomenon to make many different measurements at microwave frequencies. One use is that VSWR and node position can be used to calculate the impedance of a test component terminating the slotted line. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Boron <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> dopant {{for such}} {{semiconductors}} as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, {{it was mostly}} replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.|$|E

5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is âˆ’1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E
