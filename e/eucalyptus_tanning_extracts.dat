40|$|High tomato diets {{have been}} {{observed}} to significantly {{reduce the risk of}} prostate cancer; however, the causal agents within tomato that produce this effect are uncertain. Lycopene, the principle and highly abundant carotenoid within tomato fruit, has been suggested to be the major causative agent due to its in vitro antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic effects; however, in vivo evidence is inconclusive, with whole tomato supplementation being more protective than pure lycopene. This implicates the involvement of other tomato nutrients and carotenoids in the protective effect. This was investigated by applying hexane extracts of tomatoes with or without alltrans- lycopene as their principal fruit carotenoid, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran to PC 3 prostate cancer cells. High performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array analysis verified that orange grape (RO) and tangerine (TAN) tomatoes had almost exclusively β-carotene and tetra-cis-lycopene as their principal carotenoid, respectively. In contrast, red grape (RR), tangerine wild-type (TWT), and commercial truss (TRUSS) tomatoes contained predominantly all-trans-lycopene. An MTT cell inhibition assay revealed that the <b>TAN</b> tomato <b>extract</b> treatment had a barely significant inhibitory effect upon PC 3 cells compared with the control, while β- carotene tomato extracts had no significant impact on PC 3 proliferation. When the tomato lines with all-trans-lycopene as their predominant carotenoid were pooled, a similar inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth was observed, with a tendency for <b>TAN</b> tomato <b>extract</b> to inhibit growth slightly better.

Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the quebracho extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg 2004. A new peat {{replacement}} product is being manufactured in South Africa. This product which is marketed under {{the brand name}} Fibregro is made from spent wattle bark originating from the <b>tanning</b> <b>extract</b> manufacturing process. Fibregro is currently being used in South Africa to dilute {{and in some instances}} replace local peat in mushroom and horticultural applications. In addition to its role as a peat replacement, Fibregro is in a position where it could also qualify to cany a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label. Once in full production it is estimated that the company will be able to produce more products than can be sold locally. As a result export opportunities need to be pursued. The United Kingdom (UK) was identified as a potential export destination on account of developments in this country in respect of the certification of forest products (especially FSC certification) and moves to reduce peat mining. A mail survey was undertaken amongst growing media producers in the UK to address two key issues relating to Fibregro, namely: • Whether Fibregro's peat free status could be exploited in the UK growing media and mushroom casing markets. • Whether enough advantages existed in the UK market to justify the extra effort and cost associated with qualifying Fibrego to carry an FSC label. Key findings arising from this survey indicate that a niche is developing in the UK growing media market for a good peat substitute. The addition of an FSC label will render the product unique in the growing media market in this country. A number of recommendations arise from this work. These are: • In order to penetrate the UK growing media market Fibrgro must be positioned as an effective peat reducing agent which is capable of extending the peat reduction levels beyond that of composts. • Fibregro distributors should be identified from amongst the larger growing media producers in the UK. • Potential use of Fibregro as a mushroom casing in the UK appears to be limited. • A combination of peat free and FSC labelling while capable of rendering Fibregro unique in the UK growing media market needs to be carefully considered on account of chain-of-custody requirements along the supply chain...|$|R

40|$|The tanning {{industry}} is currently {{influenced by the}} globalization of international markets. Competitiveness among industries has increased substantially. This therefore results in the need to further control the tanning processes in order to adjust each process thus preventing potential manufacturing errors. To avoid compromising production, controls must be performed in the least possible time. In the case of vegetable-tanned leather the official method for determining the ‘degree of tannage’ or ‘combined tannins’ parameters is not directly from a single standardized test method. The procedure to obtain these parameters involves performing several independent analyses and these present several drawbacks. The process is slow, {{involves the use of}} pollutants and the reproducibility of results depends on the experience of the analysts who perform the test. Consequently, the determination is infeasible in some cases. Our work aims to develop a new analytical method for determining the tanning degree and the parameters associated with its calculation (combined tannins, hide substance and leather substance) of leathers <b>tanned</b> with vegetable <b>extracts</b> in order to solve this problem. We prepared a wide group of leathers for this purpose, tanned with a mixture of vegetable extracts (mimosa and quebracho) and having different values of the degree of tannage. Initially, the spectra of leather samples were recorded by Fourier-Transform Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Attenuated Total Reflectance cell (ATR). They were also recorded with Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIR) using a fibre optic module. The subsequent mathematical treatment of spectral signals by a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) chemometric method enabled the calculation of the parameters studied. The analytical method proposed has several advantages over the traditional method. It enables direct leather analysis, without any manipulation, {{in a very short time}} and without using chemicals. Finally, this method allows systematic, fast and easy process control at a very low cost.

A pilot plant for the production of difficult extracts for tannery at FILK was constructed and built as an result of the investigations in laboratory. Results of the investigations: the insert of additives to extraction, of enzymes and of ultrafiltration had no positive influence on quality and yield or quantity of tanning agents. The tanning agents should be produced in powder form for tannery. The extraction with solvent-water-mixtures delivered good suitable extracts for tannery. The results of the developed analysing method for tanning agents with HPLC are correlating with the values of the 'skin powder method' and the method of Folin. Because of this the discribed HPLC-method can be used as an analysing method for tanning agents while the process of extraction. The produced powders contained contents of pure tanning agents of 53 to 63 %, of none-tannins of 30 to 36 % and of insoluble substances of 5 to 14 %.
