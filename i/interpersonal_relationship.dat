25|$|The goal of Sher's NIH {{grant was}} to {{determine}} if improvement in a couple's <b>interpersonal</b> <b>relationship</b> would result in sustained changes in health behavior, improvement in the couple's quality of life, and health benefits specific to the cardiac patient. Working out of labs at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and Rush University Hospital, Sher's team recruited 160 participants (approximately 35% minorities, 30% women) in which one member suffered from a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, bypass graft surgery, angioplasty). Using a short term couples intervention strategy designed to optimize relationships and reduce interpersonal stress, the team focused on three areas of change: exercise, weight management, and compliance with lipid-lowering medication. These areas were targeted because of the difficulty many cardiac patients face in maintaining long-term commitments to change.|$|E

25|$|According to Larson and Yao (2005), empathy should {{characterize}} physicians' {{interactions with}} their patients because, despite advancement in medical technology, the <b>interpersonal</b> <b>relationship</b> between physicians and patients remains essential to quality healthcare. Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy {{a form of}} emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional satisfaction when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.|$|E

2500|$|By contrast, many {{recent studies}} of the Greek word pistis have {{concluded}} that its primary and most common meaning was faithfulness, meaning firm commitment in an <b>interpersonal</b> <b>relationship.</b> As such, the word could be almost synonymous with [...] "obedience" [...] when {{the people in the}} relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to [...] "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need [...] "faithfully" [...] to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying {{that we need to have}} [...] "faith" [...] that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that [...] "faith without works is dead" [...] and that [...] "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" [...] (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to [...] believe places one on the same level as the demons (see James 2). The [...] "new" [...] perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended [...] "faith" [...] to mean a full submission to God.|$|E
