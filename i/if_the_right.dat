5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> candidate could be found.|$|E
5|$|Demons can {{be talked}} with in battle and {{recruited}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> conversation is initiated. Once {{a part of}} the player's party, they will fight alongside them. In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with one human companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a higher power ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer {{the existence of the}} right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and {{from the fact that it}} is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E

5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI {{stated that}} as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was little chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> equipment was installed, the ground station could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the right}} to be {{identified}} has been asserted, it applies for the duration of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> is then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, the author must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E

40|$|One of Coase 2 ̆ 7 s central {{insights}} is that {{distinguishing between}} the generator and recipient of an externality is of limited value because externality problems are reciprocal. We reconsider {{the relevance of}} the identity of the generator in a model with non-contractible investment ex ante but frictionless bargaining over the externality ex post. In this framework, a party may distort its investment to worsen the other 2 ̆ 7 s threat point in bargaining. We demonstrate that the presence of this distortion depends, among other factors, on whether the investing party is a generator. Social efficiency can sometimes be improved by conditioning property <b>rights</b> on <b>the</b> identity of the generator: for example, assigning damage <b>rights</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> holder is a generator and injunction <b>rights</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> holder is a recipient can be more efficient than either unconditional damage or injunction rights...|$|R

25|$|The disease {{typically}} involves sensory {{and motor}} loss, {{as well as}} painful physical perceptions (paresthesias), though all sensory modalities may be involved. Symptoms that affect the sensory and motor systems seem to develop symmetrically. For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> foot is affected, the left foot is affected simultaneously or soon becomes affected. In most cases, the legs are affected first, followed by the arms. The hands usually become involved when the symptoms reach above the ankle. This is called a stocking-and-glove pattern of sensory disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court usually looks {{first to}} see whether the right is a {{fundamental}} right by examining whether it is deeply rooted in American history and traditions. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> is not a fundamental right, the court applies a rational basis test: if the violation of the right can be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, the law is then held valid. If the court establishes that the right being violated is a fundamental right, it applies strict scrutiny and asks whether the law is justified by a compelling state interest and whether the law is narrowly tailored to address that interest.|$|E

25|$|Localization of lesions or {{inflammatory}} {{and infectious}} processes {{can be difficult}} to discern on chest radiograph, but can be inferenced by silhouetting and the hilum overlay sign with adjacent structures.

If the left heart border is blurred, this implies a process at the lingula.|$|E

The Captain became worried about bad weather and low clouds on the left hand downwind. The aircraft then started its descent. The First Officer then repeated the request, but it wasn't agreed on by the control tower, and retained the decision for the crew to make a left downwind. Once again the Captain requested <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> downwind was available, but this still wasn't agreed on by the control tower.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a {{holometabolous}} lifecycle, meaning they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina typically has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop.

In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely. Three indicators, however, are considered of primary importance in determining the likelihood of successful eradication: that effective interventional tools are available to interrupt transmission of the agent, such as a vaccine; that diagnostic tools, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, be available to detect infections that can lead to transmission of the disease; and that humans are required for the life-cycle of the agent, which has no other vertebrate reservoir and cannot amplify in the environment.|$|E
