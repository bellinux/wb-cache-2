5|$|John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in December 1292. On 13 February 1293, Winchelsey {{was elected}} as his successor. Unusually, neither the pope nor the king <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his election. On 1 April, Winchelsey left England for Rome to get papal confirmation. He was not consecrated {{immediately}} {{because of a}} papal vacancy; Celestine V eventually performed the ceremony at Aquila on 12 September 1294.|$|E

5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There {{is some evidence that}} Pope Alexander III <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' predecessor, Caracalla, {{was murdered}} by a disaffected soldier during a {{campaign}} against Parthia on 8 April 217. Macrinus himself may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the murder of Caracalla. Within days of Caracalla's death, Macrinus was proclaimed emperor {{with the support of}} the army. At the time of his accession he inherited all of the problems that Caracalla had left for Rome—war against Parthia, threats from Armenia and Dacia, and extensive fiscal expenditures. Macrinus successfully concluded a peace with Parthia, but it came at considerable cost to Rome. Finally, his policies to reduce monetary expenditures only stoked discontent within the military.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E

5|$|After {{struggling}} mightily {{during spring}} training {{in which he}} threw with a new crouched delivery, Zito began the 2012 season with a start against the Rockies on April 9. He threw arguably {{one of the best}} games of his career, throwing a complete game shutout while giving up just 4 hits in the 7–0 Giants victory. It was his first shutout since 2003 when {{he was a member of}} the Oakland Athletics. In a June 3 home game matchup with the Cubs, Zito pitched four-hit shutout ball into the ninth inning for a 2–0 Giants win and brought his season ERA below 3.00. In earning the win, Zito earned his 150th career win, becoming the 246th pitcher to hit the mark. Zito <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the Giants' second road shutout win of the season when he pitched seven innings, allowing three hits and recording four strikeouts, in a July 17 game versus the Atlanta Braves. The win pushed his season record to 8–6. Zito would go on to finish the season with a 15–8 record, his most wins in a season with the Giants, while sporting a 4.15 ERA.|$|E
5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{experience}} led to {{him being}} promoted {{to a similar}} flotilla, this time to be deployed against Dunkirk {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance, Willem Meesters. Benbow's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell's fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow's squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from Dunkirk, and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued by professionals. It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E
5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E

5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite {{attempts by the}} Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620). In the Highlands the seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairlock. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen in Lewis alone. The oppression of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 {{and the level of}} musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725). The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for lowland Scots songs.
