50|$|Whether a sundial is a bifilar, {{or whether}} it's the {{familiar}} flat-dial {{with a straight}} style (like the usual horizontal and vertical-declining sundials), making it reclining, vertical-declining, or reclining-declining is exactly the same. The declining or reclining-declining mounting is achieved {{in exactly the same}} manner, whether the dial is bifilar, or the usual straight-style <b>flat</b> <b>dial.</b>|$|E
50|$|In general, sundials {{indicate}} {{the time by}} casting a shadow or throwing light onto a surface known as a dial face or dial plate. Although usually a <b>flat</b> plane, the <b>dial</b> face {{may also be the}} inner or outer surface of a sphere, cylinder, cone, helix, and various other shapes.|$|R
50|$|A sundial is {{a device}} that tells {{the time of day}} by the {{apparent}} position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word, it consists of a <b>flat</b> plate (the <b>dial)</b> and a gnomon, which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the Sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different hour-lines, which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or nodus may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, wire, or elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude.|$|R
