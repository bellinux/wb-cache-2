50|$|The {{conclusion}} {{to develop a}} highway with access control provides <b>highway</b> <b>grade</b> <b>separations</b> or interchanges for all intersecting highways. Once it had been decided to develop the route as an expressway, all intersecting highways should be terminated, rerouted or provided with a <b>grade</b> <b>separation.</b> The proposed corridor was access-controlled and limited access was to be provided at National Highway/SHI Major road crossings. A 2-lane service roads designed to carry two-way traffic, were proposed {{on both sides of}} the corridor. Low level underpasses were to be provided for connecting both the service roads at every 1-2 km, where the terrain permits.|$|R
50|$|A partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange or parclo is {{a modification of}} a cloverleaf interchange. The parclo interchange was invented by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation {{as a replacement for}} the cloverleaf on 400-Series <b>Highways</b> where full <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> is not required, removing the dangerous weaving patterns and allowing for more acceleration and deceleration space on the freeway.|$|R
5000|$|The Texas U-turn allows traffic {{traveling}} on one {{direction of a}} one-way frontage road, running parallel to a highway, to cross the <b>highway</b> (via a <b>grade</b> <b>separation)</b> and turn onto the other frontage road, traveling in the opposite direction. The term refers to roadworks which are specially built for this purpose; and does not refer to use of an intersecting roadway to navigate between frontage roads.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{renumbering}} in 2003, {{portions of}} US491 in New Mexico have been upgraded to a four-lane divided <b>highway,</b> with <b>grade</b> <b>separations</b> at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation has noted that, as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but remain {{high on the}} two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, the most dangerous portions of the highway have moved to points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This has caused the department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The Brooker Highway {{was opened}} in stages from 1961 to {{alleviate}} traffic congestion on the Main Road. In 1965 a Transportation Study was released offering a set plan on constructing and upgrading Hobart's Highways. While this transport study {{was seen as}} more of a [...] "highway plan" [...] rather than a [...] "comprehensive transport plan, it did provide clear guidelines for the Brooker <b>Highway</b> including <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> and additional lanes. However these guidelines have not been followed for the southern portion on the highway. With Annual average daily traffic of 48,000, the Brooker Highway is currently below the acceptable levels of service and congestion issues are expected to worsen significantly over the next 20 years with the Highway already approaching its designed capacity. While at present, Brooker Highway is considerably less congested than in other states during peak hours, it is more congested off-peak than roads in Queensland and Western Australia, and almost as congested as those in New South Wales. It is thus a busy road by any Australian standard.|$|R
5000|$|The Trans-Canada Highway (or Trans-Canada) is {{a highway}} that crosses all of Canada {{from east to}} west and enters all ten provinces. The Trans-Canada ranges from a two-lane highway as it runs through the {{mountains}} of British Columbia, a multi-lane at-grade divided <b>highway</b> with occasional <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> as it travels through the western provinces, a two-lane at-grade highway again as it passes through the sparsely populated areas of northern Ontario, and a multi-lane freeway as it travels through southern Ontario, southern Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. There are three or more ferry routes along the Trans-Canada, which allows the it to connect to Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Haida Gwaii, and Vancouver Island. The Confederation Bridge provides an alternative route from New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island.|$|R
40|$|Deep-corrugated {{steel plate}} {{structures}} {{have been in}} use throughout the world since 1988. While they provide economical alternatives for short to medium span bridges, <b>highway</b> and rail <b>grade</b> <b>separations</b> and hydraulic structures, the most abundant application is for box culverts. Until the use of deep corrugated plate, typical maximum spans for metal box culverts were around 8 m (25 ft.). Deep corrugated plate quickly extended this span range up to 12 m. The innovative application of encased-concrete, composite ribs, has further extended box culvert spans up to the 14 m range. This paper describes the features and construction of a 14. 1 m span, deep corrugated steel box culvert with encased concrete ribs which was installed over Price Creek on Highway 11 in Northern Ontario. This structure {{represents one of the}} longest box culvert structures in North America. The manufactured, deep-corrugated plate and the components of the composite rib system are presented. The paper also describes some of the construction aspects o...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{straightforward}} {{improvements in}} rail capacity can often encourage some truck freight {{to shift to}} rail. These alterations can also keep some through rail traffic on the system for a longer distance rather than shifting the cargo to trucks. Doing so can {{reduce the number of}} trucks added to the surrounding highways. The effects of such rail system improvements are generally felt at the corridor level, rather than in any particular urban area along a parallel rail/highway corridor. Successful coordinated programs to reduce roadway congestion by implementing freight rail often fall outside of the reach of just one metropolitan planning organization (MPO) or other regional planning organization. Some spot improvements such as addressing signal interconnections between rail and adjacent <b>highway</b> intersections or <b>grade</b> <b>separations</b> at highway-rail <b>grade</b> crossings can be implemented through planning at the local level and can improve traffic flow to railroad approaches or along service roads feeding into major roadway congestion points...|$|R
40|$|Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) {{walls are}} one of the most common soil-retaining {{structures}} in the world. They are cost-effective soil-retaining structures that can tolerate large settlements compared to conventional gravity retaining walls. MSE walls are also an economical way to meet everyday earth retention needs for <b>highway</b> and bridge <b>grade</b> <b>separations,</b> railroads, commercial and residential developments. However, available literature and design guidelines for back-to-back MSE walls are limited. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of reinforced back-to-back MSE walls on wall settlements and facing deformations. Models of unreinforced and reinforced retaining walls were modeled and compared using commercially available finite element package PLAXIS 2 D and a finite difference package FLAC 2 D. Parametric studies were performed to determine the effect of types of facing, spacing between the reinforcements, axial stiffness of reinforcement, friction angles of backfill and foundation soil on foundation settlement, surface settlement, and horizontal displacement of the facing panel. The effects of varying spacing between reinforcements, and friction angle of backfill soil on the critical failure surface and the tension developed in the reinforcements were also studied...|$|R
40|$|Many {{corridors}} in the Texas State {{highway system}} are facing increasing congestion while having severe right-ofway limitations. The best form of congestion relief {{may not be}} additional <b>highway</b> lanes and/or <b>grade</b> <b>separations.</b> The best solution may be {{the introduction of a}} higher capacity transit system. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has been increasingly regarded as a cost-effective solution for improving mobility and alleviating congestion in urban transportation networks. Our research was aimed at providing TxDOT with comprehensive guidelines for planning and designing BRT that allows development of a BRT scenario in the traditional alternatives analysis. Specifically, this research developed a decision procedure to help TxDOT engineers/MPO planners decide the role of BRT {{as an integral part of}} existing/future transportation systems. The research team included identification and evaluation of analysis tools and methods for measuring the effectiveness/impact of BRT. Design criteria was developed for BRT concepts, including possible street re-alignment, geometric considerations, right-of-way acquisition, signal preemption, dedicated/shared busways on major state arterials, as well as integration of BRT into existing and futur...|$|R
