[...] "Preservation Maryland", a statewide preservation advocacy organization, conferred its Stewardship Award in 2007 on the Hampton National Historic Site for refurnishing the mansion's rooms with historical accuracy while unobtrusively installing the fire suppression and climate control systems.|$|E
500|$|Actor Stephen Lang portrayed Pickett in the 1993 film Gettysburg. Billy Campbell portrayed {{him in the}} 2003 prequel Gods and Generals. In a 2003 interview, Lang {{commented that}} [...] "for all of Pickett's flamboyance, there's {{something}} organically sad about him. Have you <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> {{at any of the}} portraits of him? You can see it in his eyes-the sadness. He could be charming, but it was tinged with sadness." ...|$|E

[...] An accident or injury in his youth caused him to lose part of his palette, and he spoke with a hoarse voice.|$|E

500|$|Corpses swell as gases from {{decomposition}} {{accumulate in}} the torso {{and the increased}} pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look [...] "plump", [...] "well-fed", and [...] "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the Arnold Paole case, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> in life. The exuding blood gave {{the impression that the}} corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} generally received positive reviews. GameSpot {{praised the}} blend of 2D and 3D graphics, and GameZone {{said that the}} graphics were [...] "better than what I had originally imagined" [...] and that [...] "a Pokemon title hasn't <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> this good on a handheld." [...] GameSpy felt that the graphics, though simple, made the game [...] "a pleasure to explore". ComputerAndVideoGames.com, however, said that [...] "the so-called '3D' isn't up to much: it's just a viewpoint shuffle, with DS's gutsy engine taking a nice long nap between the odd hypnotic windfarm or fog effect." [...] The audio was not so well-received: IGN felt that the cries made by the Pokémon [...] "still screech with the flair of the original Game Boy" [...] and that the music, while [...] "more advanced", was [...] "not much beyond [...] quality". GameZone also felt that the sounds had not been updated, saying [...] "This [...] is the only area that hasn't taken one step forward. It remains stagnant and doesn't show any progression over the GBA titles". GameSpot cited the games' [...] "recycled" [...] sounds {{as one of the}} negative points.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics and fans, and in 2010 {{it became the}} most-viewed video in YouTube history, up to that point. Tim Stack from Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "amazing" [...] and added, [...] "I don't think Gaga has <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> prettier than in the close-ups where she's more stripped down." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! was also impressed by the video and commented, [...] "This music video really makes us appreciate everything Gaga actually brings to pop music. She's exciting to watch, plain and simple. ... We need someone like Gaga to really bring it. To put actual thought and care into her product so that it feels alive". Issie Lapowsky of New York Daily News thought Gaga laid the [...] "theatrics on thick" [...] in the video but complimented her for wearing minimal makeup, calling it [...] "refreshingly normal". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times said that the video brought back his faith in performance art, and that [...] "Gaga brings enough [...] on her own, thank you very much." [...] He also thought the set for the video [...] "worthy of a feature-length film". Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone felt that the scenes from the music video were reminiscent {{of the work of}} Stanley Kubrick. He added that in [...] "Bad Romance" [...] Gaga portrays her craziest ideas yet.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has <b>ever</b> <b>looked.</b> It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E

[...] In [...] "Glitter in the Air", Pink asks many questions such as, [...] "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> fear in the face and said I just don’t care?", and [...] "Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?"

Her mother, Sarah Frances Bow (née Gordon, 1880–1923), was told by a doctor not to become {{pregnant}} again, for fear the next baby might die, as well. Despite the warning, Sarah became pregnant with Clara in late 1904. In addition to the risky pregnancy, a heat wave besieged New York in July 1905, and temperatures peaked around [...] Years later, Clara said: [...] "I don't suppose two people <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> death in the face more clearly than my mother and I the morning I was born.

Ullman on Sally: [...] "In Europe, {{there are lots of}} topless protesters and it just seemed like a topless member of British Parliament would be the next thing. So I just played her like a mom going to work." [...] On the subject on the character's prosthetic breasts, Ullman revealed that production asked if she wanted a molding of her actual breasts. [...] "I thought, 'No, no, no!'" [...] Ullman praised the BBC for agreeing not to pixelate the character's nipples. [...] "t was very tough to wear those prosthetic breasts and talk to the crew. You either had the people who stared at your tits — or the ones who are determined to look you in your eyes. My director, bless him, never <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> at me below neck on those shooting days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hepburn {{was noted}} for her fashion choices and {{distinctive}} look, {{to the extent}} that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand. When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than to men, in comparison to the curvy and more sexual Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor. With her short hair style, thick eyebrows, slim body and [...] "gamine" [...] looks, she presented a look which young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars. In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the [...] "public embodiment of our new feminine ideal" [...] in Vogue, and wrote that [...] "Nobody <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> like her before World War II ... Yet we recognize the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared." [...] The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade. Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable.|$|E
2500|$|Significant edits {{were made}} to {{aggressive}} and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. [...] Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words [...] "kids" [...] and [...] "Columbine" [...] from the line [...] "I take seven [...] from , stand them all in line" [...] from [...] "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, [...] "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad." [...] The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song [...] "Rap God" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line [...] "It doesn't matter [...] faggot" [...] was also censored from [...] "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.|$|E

2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she <b>ever</b> <b>looked</b> before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E
