5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> and {{medicine}} for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that {{a brain tumor}} has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E

25|$|Because of this, {{cooking oil}} {{should never be}} dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl.

That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got rid of the gun.|$|R
40|$|This article {{uses the}} hedonic pricing method to {{estimate}} the price premium paid for the highest energy-efficiency label (A+) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerators</b> market of <b>the</b> Basque Autonomous Community (Spain). The estimated figure is 8. 9 % of the final price or about 60 euro, which represents {{one third of the}} energy savings that a consumer gets during the lifetime of a <b>refrigerator</b> with <b>the</b> highest energy-efficiency label. This figure is then combined with the linear version of the Almost Ideal Demand System (LA/AIDS) to obtain own and cross-price elasticities of demand. The information presented here is useful for policy design and analysis. The results indicate that <b>the</b> demand for <b>refrigerators</b> with <b>the</b> highest energy-efficiency label is highly sensitive to price variations. ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{cause of}} vitamin C being lost from food is leaching, where the {{water-soluble}} vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed. However, vitamin C does not leach in all vegetables {{at the same}} rate; research shows broccoli seems to retain more than any other. Research has also shown that freshly cut fruits do not lose significant nutrients when stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> for a few days.|$|E
25|$|July 15: Oliver Lacy, 24. A {{bodybuilding}} enthusiast whom Dahmer enticed to {{his apartment}} {{on the promise of}} money for posing for photographs. Lacy was drugged and strangled with a leather strap before being decapitated, with his head and heart being placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> His skeleton was retained to adorn one side of the private shrine of skulls and skeletons Dahmer {{was in the process of}} creating when arrested one week later.|$|E
25|$|Basil is most {{commonly}} used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept {{for a short time}} in plastic bags <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavor, like hay.|$|E
40|$|The {{humid air}} turbine (HAT), {{patented}} by FLuor Daniel, is an innovative cycle which allows {{to obtain an}} increase in efficiency and power production.

50|$|Frost-free refrigerators, {{including}} some early frost free refrigerator/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don't shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>refrigerator</b> compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate {{to aid the}} defrosting cycle.|$|R
25|$|On July 15, Dahmer {{encountered}} 24-year-old Oliver Lacy at {{the corner}} of 27th and Kilbourn. Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive; after unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with chloroform, he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended. After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> and his skeleton in the freezer. Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired. Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.|$|E
25|$|Firm kiwifruit ripen after a {{few days}} to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster {{ripening}} occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana. Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} an {{airtight}} container made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
50|$|Cool Whip {{was created}} in 1966 by George Lorant, a food {{scientist}} at General Foods.

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> for a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen {{for up to two}} or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
