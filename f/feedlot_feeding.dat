Bacteria, methanogenic archaea and ciliate protozoa existing in the rumen and reticulum were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and light microscopy in buffalo in two feeding systems, grazing and feedlot. Results No significant differences were observed in the total concentrations of bacteria/mL and archaea between rumen and reticulum, and between pasture and feedlots, or interactions between variables. However, the largest density of bacteria and smallest density of archaea was observed in the rumen of grazing animals. The total ciliates protozoa community was higher in grazing buffalo than those in the feedlot on a concentrated diet. There were significant interactions between location in the gastrointestinal tract (rumen vs reticulum) and types of diets (grazing vs feedlot) in the composition of ciliates.

Although, IPCC recommends {{the use of a}} more specific Tier 3 approach, this is hampered by a lack of consolidated data for development, evaluation and application of such a Tier 3 approach. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the effect of improving diet quality by feeding supplements on methane emission, calculated by both a Tier 2 and an extant Tier 3 approach, in different production systems of beef cattle in Brazil: (1) high quality diet and <b>feedlot</b> <b>feeding</b> from weaning to slaughter- FSFF - Feedlot finishing (14 mth); (2) energy and protein supplementation - ESPF - Pasture finishing (20 mth); (3) protein supplementation during dry and wet season - PSFF - Feedlot finishing (24 mth); (4) protein supplementation dry at first and second dry seasons combined with ad libitum mineral salt supplementation and protein supplementation wet at first and second wet season, respectively- PSPF - Pasture finishing (30 mth); (5) urea supplementation with mineral salt during the dry season and ad libitum salt during the wet season - USFF - Feedlot finishing (36 mth); (6) urea salt during the dry season and ad libitum mineral salt during the wet season - USPF - Pasture finishing (44 mth). Tier 2 and Tier 3 approaches estimated a profound effect of supplementation on methane emission. Tier 2 estimates ranged from 168 (USPF) to 35 kg per animal (FSFF) while Tier 3 estimates ranged from 145 (USPF) to 32 (FSFF) kg per animal.

40|$|There is wide {{availability}} of corn stover in many corn growing {{regions of the}} United States. As a livestock feed input, corn stover {{has the potential to}} be a valuable component in the rations of both dairy and beef cattle. This research assesses the economic viability of lime-treated corn stover as a replacement feedstock primarily for a portion of corn silage in the diets of mid- and late lactating dairy cows and as a replacement feedstock primarily for corn grain in beef cattle. This research also assesses best farmer management practices to mitigate environmental impacts of stover removal. ^ Hypothetical dairy operations and beef feedlots are assumed in Elkhart County, Indiana and Washington County, Indiana, respectively. Data from four dairy feeding trials and three beef <b>feedlot</b> <b>feeding</b> trials are used to determine lime-treated corn stover’s economic viability as a livestock feed input. Data from the Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework is used to quantify the environmental impacts resulting from the ration substitutions in the feeding trials. For both dairy and beef operations, feed rations including lime-treated corn stover were always cost-effective compared to the control rations. Only dairy feeding trial one produced a negative income over feed cost (IOFC) calculation, where a decrease in milkfat production compromises the profitability of the feed substitution. The average annual increase in returns per lactating cow on a dairy farm when lime-treated corn stover was included in feed rations was $ 119. 42 /cow. The average annual increase in returns per beef feedlot animal was $ 40. 82 /head when fed lime-treated corn stover. This research did not consider potential benefits from feeding lime-treated corn stover to other segments of the dairy herd, such as replacement heifers. ^ Environmental impacts considered were soil erosion, changes in soil organic carbon, and rate of nitrate leaching. Values were assigned to these environmental categories, and impacts from specific crop rotation changes were integrated into the economic analysis. Crop rotations involving corn silage were the most environmentally degrading, and corn silage could only be grown sustainably when managed with a winter cover crop. The incorporation of environmental values to the economic values of the feed substitutions can impact the social outcome of the feed substitution. In general, as the rate of corn stover harvest increases to supply stover for the feed substitutions, the more likely the social impact of the feed substitution will become negative. However, this outcome is dependent upon the value of soil erosion used in the analysis, which is a topic for future research. ...|$|E

40|$|Cattle weights can {{be highly}} {{variable}} and are influenced by many factors, including time of weighing, ambient temperature, feed intake, and cattle handling. A protocol of limit feeding has been in use since the 1980 s {{that was designed to}} reduce variation in gut fill due to differences in intakes. Cattle are penned and fed a 50 % hay, 50 % wet corn gluten feed or grain diet (DM basis) at an estimated 2 % of BW for at least 5 d, after which weights are taken on 2 consecutive d and averaged for a limit-fed BW (LFW). For this analysis, full-fed weights (FFW) also were taken before the limit-feeding period while cattle had ad libitum intakes. Data from 18 experiments were used to analyze differences within 2 -d LFW and between LFW and FFW. For 10 of the 18 experiments, FFW also were measured on 2 consecutive d. Cattle included in this summary were grazing cornstalks, smooth bromegrass pasture, Bermuda grass pasture, fescue pasture, native range, or in a dry lot on a 70 % forage diet. The largest differences between FFW and LFW for individual cattle were - 39 to + 44 kg over all 18 experiments. Differences between 2 consecutive d of LFW were - 23 to + 24 kg for all 18 experiments. Differences between 2 d of FFW were - 14 to + 34 kg in the 10 experiments measuring FFW on 2 consecutive d. There was not a clear relationship between FFW and LFW; each weighing scenario had unique environmental conditions that led to different relationships. Differences in both beginning and ending BW were compounded when calculating ADG. Average daily gain was calculated for 15 of the experiments on the basis of either LFW or FFW. Differences between LFW and FFW ADG were - 0. 29 to + 0. 31 kg/d. The maximum ADG based on FFW was 1. 62 kg/d. This large ADG, on a forage based diet, was likely due to changes in gut fill rather than tissue gain. These data suggest that handling cattle in a similar manner when weighing is more important than limiting intakes to decrease variance between weights. However, limiting intake before collection of beginning and ending BW better estimates empty body weight of cattle, allowing for a more accurate determination of actual body tissue weight gain. Measuring weights accurately becomes especially crucial when evaluating multiple components within a system (e. g., cornstalks to pasture to <b>feedlot).</b> <b>Feeding</b> a standard diet between these components of the system minimizes differences in gut fill due to treatment and allows for a more accurate determination of each component’s contribution to the total system...|$|E

Cultural energy {{analyses}} of climatologically suitable places in Turkey for feedlot cattle production determined {{by using the}} comprehensive climate index model. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 26 - 26. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 057 The objective {{of this study was}} to conduct cultural energy analyses on feedlot cattle production in Turkey. The comprehensive climate index (CCI) model was used to predict DMI, ADG, and feed efficiency of feedlot cattle in 15 locations in Turkey. The CCI enables one to quantify beef cattle performance for a number of breeds based on environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) at any time in the year. Because mostly dairy breed calves are placed into the feedlot in Turkey, the Holstein (dairy breed) option in the CCI was chosen to calculate the maintenance energy requirement. Based on previous <b>feedlot</b> <b>feeding</b> studies conducted in Turkey, it was assumed that calves would be placed on feed at 250 kg and be marketed at 520 kg and that the diet would have 2600 kcal/kg metabolic energy and would have DMI of 2. 31 % of the BW. It was assumed that cattle would receive 2 kg/d straw and that the concentrate mixture would consist of 52. 65 % barley, 26 % corn, 19 % cotton seed meal, 1. 5 % limestone, 0. 25 % vitamins, 0. 5 % salt, and 0. 1 % minerals. Cultural energy inputs were calculated by multiplying the amount of inputs and their corresponding cultural energy based on values from existing literature. Cultural energy used for feed was derived from DMI of cattle and corresponding values for each feed ingredient. Transportation energy was also included in the analysis, including costs for shipping calves from animal market to the farm, shipping yearlings to slaughterhouse, and shipping feed ingredients to the farm. Cultural energy expended for feed made up more than half of the total cultural energy and differed among cities (P < 0. 05). Cultural energy for feed was highest for the coldest places and lowest for hot locations. Cultural energy of transportation constituted the second highest cultural energy expenditure. Cultural energy expended per kilogram live weight gain (defined as total cultural energy expended divided by kg live weight gain) was highest for the coldest location and lowest for relatively hotter cities (P < 0. 05). Cultural energy use efficiency (defined by kcal input/kcal output) followed the feed efficiency ranking with cattle having better feed efficiency also have better cultural energy use efficiency. Results showed that cattle having higher ADG did not mean that they would also have better cultural energy use efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The new Animal Evaluation Model {{predicts that}} heavier live weight (LW) of the {{lactating}} cow reduces {{the profitability of}} the pasture-based dairying farm in New Zealand, because its effects on increased maintenance requirements are not fully compensated by the extra income generated from selling heavier culled cattle and surplus progeny. The work outlined in this thesis was intended to validate the expected effects of selection for differences in LW on actual LW from birth to maturity and on herbage intake and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) of growing cattle and lactating cows. It also investigated the existence of any associated effects on calving difficulty, calf mortality, onset of puberty and reproductive performance of the two lines of Holstein-Friesian (HF) cattle bred for heavy or light mature LW. These two lines have been developed at the Dairy Cattle Research Unit, Massey University, New Zealand, since 1989. The high genetic merit HF cows from the base herd have been mated to high genetic merit HF sires with either high or low breeding value (BV) for LW but with similar breeding worth (BW) in order to generate the heavy (H) and the light (L) mature LW selection lines. During the period 1994 to 1997, a series of experiments with growing heifers and lactating cows from the H and L lines, and analysis of data collected from the cows were undertaken to compare the two genetic lines. The BV's for live weight of the sires were 86 kg for the H and 31 kg for the L cows and the actual H animals were heavier at birth (41 vs. 35 kg) and at maturity (510 vs. 460 kg). In addition the BV's for milk (1037 vs. 737 l), milkfat (33. 0 vs. 27. 5 kg) and milk protein (31 kg vs. 22 kg) of H sires were also higher and the H cows produced significantly more milk (4708 vs. 4323 l/lactation), more milkfat (207 vs. 198 kg/lactation) and more milk protein (157 vs. 150 kg/lactation) than the L cows. However, the L sires had slightly higher breeding worth ($ 46 vs. $ 37) than the H sires and theoretically calculated and experimentally measured feed intakes and the resultant feed conversion efficiencies, confirmed that the L cows had slightly higher values for FCE than the H cows in three short-term grazing experiments and when FCE was calculated over multiple lactations. Therefore the basic assumptions in the Animal Evaluation Model seem to be correct. Sires of H cows had {{a higher proportion of}} USA Holstein genes in their pedigrees than the L sires. Consequently cows from the H line had a higher (≈ 27 %) proportion of USA Holstein genes compared to cows from the L line (≈ 7 %), whose sires were mainly of New Zealand ancestry. New Zealand bulls are progeny tested under grazing conditions and a very tight seasonal system of reproduction, whereas North American bulls are progeny tested under dairying systems of all year round milk production and <b>feedlot</b> <b>feeding.</b> There were significant differences in the pattern of grazing behaviour of H and L cows. The L cows displayed a more 'aggressive' pattern of grazing behaviour than H cows given by significantly longer grazing times (520 vs. 499 min/d), faster rates of biting (58 vs. 52 bites/min), higher number of total bites per day (31053 vs. 25046 bites/d), lower rumination times (471 vs. 572 min/d), and the selection of herbage of higher digestibility (72. 0 % vs. 69. 3 %). These results may reflect not only a difference in mature LW between the H and L cows, but may also reflect a strain of Holstein (i. e. NZ vs. USA Holstein) difference due to the sires' ancestry referred to above. There were no differences between H and L cows in the incidence of calving difficulty. However, offspring of bulls with high BV for rump width (i. e. wider pelvises) were more likely to face a difficult calving, and so were daughters of bulls with low BV for rump angle (i. e. less sloping pelvises). There were no differences between H and L cows for calf mortality. However, induced calves were more likely to die or undertake an emergency slaughter, and the H cows had significantly higher induction rates than the L cows (10. 5 vs. 4. 2 %). The H heifers grew faster, ate more feed (4. 3 vs. 3. 8 kg/hd/d) and were heavier (241 vs. 221 kg) and older (325 vs. 300 d) at puberty than L heifers, and there were no differences between H and L heifers in pregnancy rate, age at first calving and first lactation yield of milk and milk components. There were only small differences in the reproductive performance of H and L cows after adjusting by differences in induction, calving date and percentage of USA Holstein genes in the cows. The L cows had slightly shorter intervals from first service to conception (13 vs. 17 d) and from the start of mating to conception (24 vs. 29 d), and slightly higher first service conception rate (65 vs. 54 %), which translated in a more concentrated calving pattern and lower induction rate (4. 2 vs. 10. 5 %) for the L cows. The results of this thesis indicate that selecting for heavier mature live weight produced the expected results of heavier animals with higher yields of milk and milk components, higher feed requirements and higher herbage intakes and slightly lower feed conversion efficiency than lighter mature live weight cows. However, there were also differences in grazing behaviour in which the L cows displayed a more competitive pattern of grazing behaviour than the H cows. The results of this thesis suggest that for the New Zealand seasonal system of milk production based almost completely on grazed pasture, lighter mature LW HF cows may have an advantage over heavier mature LW cows. Under the conditions of this experiments L cows were slightly more efficient, younger at puberty, had a more concentrated calving pattern, and were less prone to be induced to calve than heavier mature live weight HF cows...|$|E

Experiment 1 demonstrated that temperament affected ADG and DMI, but not FCR or RFI. Residual feed intake was not phenotypically correlated to scrotal circumference or bull fertility traits. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that RFI was independent of ADG and BW, but that there was a tendency (P 0. 5 SD above mean RFI). Results from experiment 2 suggest that RFI measured while calves are consuming high-grain diets may be less influenced by previous level of stocker supplementation compared to FCR or residual gain efficiency traits. In summary, RFI was found to be phenotypically independent of growth rate and BW, had no effect on bull fertility or temperament traits, and was less impacted by previous plane of nutrition compared to FCR...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the prevalence and longitudinal distribution of Escherichia coli O 157 in feedlot cattle and the feedlot environment. Pen floors, water tanks, other cattle in the <b>feedlot,</b> <b>feed,</b> and bird feces were sampled for 2 weeks prior to entry of the study cattle. Twelve pens of study cattle were sampled twice weekly. At each sample time cattle feces, water from tanks in each pen, bunk feed, feed components, bird feces, and houseflies were collected. Bunk feed samples were collected before and after cattle had access to the feed. Overall, 28 % of cattle fecal samples, 3. 9 % of bird fecal samples, 25 % of water samples, 3. 4 % of housefly samples, 1. 25 % of bunk feed before calf access, and 3. 25 % of bunk feed samples after cattle had access to the feed were positive for E. coli O 157. Genetic analysis of E. coli O 157 isolates was done using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE types identified in sampling of the feedlot prior to calf entry were different than the majority of types identified following calf entry. A single strain type predominated in the samples collected after entry of the cattle. It was first identified 5 days after entry of the first pen of cattle and was subsequently identified in all pens. Data support that the incoming cattle introduced a new strain that became the predominant strain in the feedlot...|$|R
50|$|Fog fever {{refers to}} cattle refeeding {{syndrome}} which is clinically named Acute bovine pulmonary emphysema and edema (ABPEE) and Bovine atypical interstitial pneumonia. This veterinary disease in adult cattle follows an abrupt move from <b>feedlot</b> (dried <b>feed</b> indoors) to 'foggage pasture' (fast growing, lush pasture, with high protein levels). Clinical signs begin within 1 to 14 days and death may follow within 2 to 4 days. The condition can affect up to 50% of the herd, and around 30% of affected cattle may die as a result. This metabolic nutritional-respiratory disturbance {{has also been}} reported in other ruminants (red deer) and {{on a wide variety}} of grasses, alfalfa, rape, kale, and turnip tops.|$|R
40|$|Derived demand {{relationships}} among four weight categories of feeder cattle entering Texas <b>feedlots</b> and <b>feed</b> were examined using a Generalized McFadden dual cost function specified as an error correction model. Relationships among own- and cross-price elasticities {{provide evidence for}} at least two cattle feeding enterprises, feeding lightweight feeder cattle (calves) and feeding heavier cattle. These results indicate systematic differences in demand {{relationships among}} the different weight classes, providing explanation and insight into mixed results from earlier studies. Seasonality differed across weight categories, providing additional support for multiple cattle feeding enterprises. A third step was added to the Engle-Granger two-step estimation procedure to incorporate information provided in the second step. Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R
40|$|The NAHMS Cattle on Feed Evaluation (COFE) was {{designed}} to provide both participants and the industry with information on the nation's feedlot animal population for education and research. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collaborated with NAHMS to select a statistically valid producer sample (3, 214 producers) to provide inferences to the nation's feedlot animal population. Included {{in the study were}} 13 states that accounted for 85. 8 percent of the U. S. cattle-on-feed inventory as of January 1, 1994.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of date of <b>feedlot</b> placement on <b>feed</b> conversion, daily gain, and death loss. Results indicated that heifers placed on feed from September to December required more feed per pound of gain, had lower daily gains and higher death loss, and generally exhibited more variation in feeding performance than heifers placed {{during the rest of}} the year. Cattle feeders should take these performance variations into account when developing budgets and calculating breakeven sale prices for heifers...|$|R
40|$|Two {{sources of}} non-protein {{nitrogen}} (ammonia gas compared with urea spray) I {{were added to}} an oat grain ration to achieve four levels of crude protein. Together with an untreated (control) ration, these were used to study the voluntary feed intakes and growth responses of Merino weaner ewes under <b>feedlot</b> conditions. <b>Feed</b> intakes increased linearly in response to increasing levels of non-protein nitrogen {{and there was no}} difference between the urea and the ammonia treatments. This was reflected in increasing growth rates in the ammonia treatments and the urea treatments except for the highest level of added urea (2. 10 per cent urea, 15. 5 per cent total crude protein) where a depressed growth rate occurred. The use of ammonia gas would appear to be a feasible alternative to urea spray with the advantage of being easier and less expensive to apply...|$|R
40|$|Manure stockpiled anaerobically or {{composted}} aerobically {{was evaluated}} for nutrient losses in two experiments. When compared on a crop nutrient basis, stockpiling feedlot manure {{had a greater}} value than composting. Similar DM losses and moisture content of the two storage methods indicated volume and weight were not substantially influenced with either method. Added costs for management, labor, land and equipment needed for composting may not be offset by decreased transportation cost to the field. When these factors are coupled with nutrient loss, anaerobic stockpiling of feedlot manure may be more economically favorable compared with composting. ^ Two experiments were conduced {{to determine the effect}} of feeding wet distillers grains (WDGS) at 0, 15 and 30 % (DM basis) on finishing steer performance and N and P mass balance in open <b>feedlot</b> pens. <b>Feeding</b> WDGS increased DMI and improved ADG when included in the diet as either a protein or energy source. The inclusion of 15 or 30 % WDGS increased the amount of P and OM removed in the manure. Not all of the additional N excreted by feeding WDGS above the animals requirement was lost; some was removed in the manure during pen cleaning. Evaluation of nutrient losses for ingredients commonly used in feedlot diets will help to minimize the impact of feeding those ingredients on the environment. ^ Six experiments were conducted to determine the influence of feeding different levels of dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) in concentrate diets on urinary pH, feedlot performance, and N mass balance in open <b>feedlot</b> pens. <b>Feeding</b> negative DCAD diets reduced urinary pH but did not have an impact on fecal pH. The influence of feeding concentrate diets with lower DCAD was not consistent and may depend on the basal diet as opposed to DCAD level. Feedlot performance {{did not appear to be}} negatively impacted when negative DCAD diets were fed. Manure pH can be lowered by feeding negative DCAD diets but N mass balance in open feedlot pens is not improved. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that farmer-feeders who finish as few as 700 head per year can compete with the large commercial feedlots from a cost perspective. The lack of a sophisticated feed mill does not prevent the farmer-feeder from being competitive with the large commercial <b>feedlots</b> in <b>feed</b> costs. This might be explained by the farmer feeder producing much of the feed, which reduces transportation and transaction costs. The farmer-feeder has non-feed costs that average 64 % more than those of the large commercial feedlots. The significantly greater costs for depreciation, repairs, and maintenance may be explained by having fewer numbers of cattle to spread the equipment over. As evidenced by the rapid structural change in the cattle feeding industry, it is not easy for the relatively smaller-scale farmer-feeder operation to compete in the cattle feeding industry. This cost-comparison study indicates that it is possible for well managed small-scale feeders to be competitive from an overall cost perspective...|$|R
