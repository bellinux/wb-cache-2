5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be in <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, {{author of the book}} Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase in <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> improving travel times. The {{study concluded that}} {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

25|$|However, {{humans are}} limited in their {{capacity}} for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy, which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Although a {{cover of}} grasses and legumes may be {{established}} on exposed mountain subsoils through seeding {{and the use of}} a complete fertiliser, this cover is not likely to last {{for more than a few}} years without the application of more fertiliser. Native tussock species once established in the protection of other low-growing species might persist and provide stability over a longer period. This paper describes the early results achieved on two sites in the Canterbury mountains, through sowing seed of four tussock species under five cover treatments. Sowing of seed of Notodanthonia setifolia produced very few seedlings but blue tussock, hard tussock and Gilver tussock gave reasonable results. Highest emergence was recorded under the least cover on the control plots, and there was, in general, an inverse relationship between cover treatment density and emergence of tussock seedlings. Survival of tussc<~k seedlings over the first eighteen months from sowing was, hQwever, in <b>direct</b> positive <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the amount of cover present. Growth of tussock seedlings was slow at both trial sites. Tiller numbers tended to be greatest in pIe. ts with least competition from cover species.

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{compressed}} air, or Nitrox mixtures, the exhaled gas is not valuable enough to justify the expense of recycling, but helium-based mixtures are considerably more expensive, and as the depth increases, the amount of gas used (in terms of mass, or number of molecules) increases in <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the ambient pressure. As a result, gas cost is {{a significant factor in}} deep open circuit diving with helium-based mixtures for long periods. By using a return line for the exhaled gas, it can be recompressed and used again, almost indefinitely. It is necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the reclaimed gas, but this is relatively cheap and uncomplicated. It is generally removed by a scrubber, which is a filter packed with a chemical which reacts with and removes the carbon dioxide from the gas. The reclaimed gas is also filtered to remove odour and microorganisms, and oxygen is added to the required concentration. The gas is compressed for storage between uses.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptional regulators, {{as well as}} {{a growing}} number of other factors, {{regulate}} the induction of beige fat. Three regulators of transcription are central to WAT browning and serve as targets for many of the molecules known to influence this process. These include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). The list of molecules that influence browning has grown in <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the popularity of this topic and is constantly evolving as more knowledge is acquired. Among these molecules are irisin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which have been well-studied and are believed to be important regulators of browning. Irisin is secreted from muscle in response to exercise and has been shown to increase browning by acting on beige preadipocytes. FGF21, a hormone secreted mainly by the liver, has garnered a great deal of interest after being identified as a potent stimulator of glucose uptake and a browning regulator through its effects on PGC-1α. It is increased in BAT during cold exposure and is thought to aid in resistance to diet-induced obesity FGF21 may also be secreted in response to exercise and a low protein diet, although the latter has not been thoroughly investigated. Data from these studies suggest that environmental factors like diet and exercise may be important mediators of browning.|$|E

40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} of Mg {{were used}} to measure bidirectional magnesium ion fluxes in single barnacle giant muscle fibers immersed in Ca- and Na-free, isosmotic media. Measurements were made using a mass spectrometric technique, thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), in conjunction with atomic absorption spectroscopy. Kinetic relations based on a first-order model were developed that permit the determination of unidirectional rate coefficients for Mg influx, ki, and efflux, ke, in the same experiment from knowledge of initial conditions and the initial and final ratios of 26 Mg/ 24 Mg and 25 Mg/ 24 Mg in ambient solutions (i. e., by isotope dilution). Such determinations were made for three values of the external Mg ion concentration: 5, 25, and 60 mM. At the concentration [Mg+ 2]o = 5 mM, ki and ke were about equal at a value of 0. 01 min- 1. At the higher values of [Mg+ 2]o, the values of ke increased along a curve suggesting saturation, whereas the values of ki remained essentially constant. As could be expected {{on the basis of}} a constant ki, the initial influx rate varied in <b>direct</b> linear <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> [Mg+ 2]o, and was 11. 8 pmol/cm 2 s when [Mg+ 2]o was 5 mM. However, the initial efflux rate appeared to increase nonlinearly with [Mg+ 2]o, varying from 13. 4 pmol/cm 2 s ([Mg+ 2]o = 5 mM) to approximately 80 pmol/cm 2 s ([Mg+ 2]o = 60 mM). The results are consistent with a model that assumes Mg influx to be mainly an electrodiffusive inward leak with PMg = 0. 07 cm/s and Mg efflux to be almost entirely by active transport processes. Where comparisons can be made, the rate coefficients determined from stable isotope measurements agree with those previously obtained using radioactive Mg. The rate coefficients can be used to correctly predict time-dependent changes in total fiber Mg content. The results support the conclusion that nonradioactive tracers can be used to measure ion fluxes and ion flux ratios in excitable cells; it is expected that this method will greatly assist in the study of Mg regulation in general...|$|R
