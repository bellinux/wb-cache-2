By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.|$|E
5|$|Following her husband's death, Reagan {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, particularly relating to stem cell research. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many {{consider to be}} the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W. Bush to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research, in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> a second term.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> {{a fourth}} term, Johnson {{concentrated}} on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, {{with a greater}} margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded {{the formation of the}} majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{launched}} <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> mayor on May 1, 2007, {{with former}} U.S. Congressman Matt Salmon as his campaign chairman. Incumbent Keno Hawker was term limited.

5|$|The Ethics Commission later granted his {{campaign}} a reprieve, allowing Wolf {{to make an}} appeal at their next scheduled meeting on September 19. At the meeting, the Commission ruled 4-1 to reverse its decision which disqualified him from public office, allowing him {{to remain in office}} and renew his candidacy Governor. On October 21, Wolf announced he was ending <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> governor, {{due to the fact that}} even though the Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months. On June 17, 2014, Wolf endorsed Don Berwick as the Democratic nominee for governor.|$|E

50|$|In the runoff, the Old Regulars threw {{their support}} behind Long. Now that his {{longtime}} enemies were supporting Long, Mayor Morrison stepped up <b>his</b> <b>campaigning</b> <b>for</b> Jones {{and began a}} feud with Long that would last until Long's death in 1960.|$|R
5|$|After this defeat, Wetherby {{moved to}} Franklin County and secured a {{position}} at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent, Bill May. From 1964 to 1966, he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution. In 1965, May backed Wetherby in <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> the Kentucky Senate. He won the election, defeating the candidate favored by Chandler, and was chosen president of that body from 1966 to 1968. He was so effective in this position that the state's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing {{by a vote of}} 31–5 in virtually the same form as it was presented.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1866, Sprigg was {{instrumental}} in organizing the Democratic Party of West Virginia, after which time he continued {{to serve as a}} leader at the party's state and regional conventions. He attended the Democratic Party's state convention held in Charleston in June 1870, where he represented the Tenth Senatorial District on the Committee on Resolutions. Sprigg was unanimously nominated as the party's candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia, initially without his knowledge. He commenced <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> attorney general at the state party's Tenth Senatorial District convention in Moorefield. Sprigg ran against incumbent Aquilla B. Caldwell and was subsequently elected to the post with 28,020 votes, a large majority, and began his term as attorney general on January 1, 1871. Sprigg was the first Democrat to serve as Attorney General of West Virginia. On February 2, 1871, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act that extended Sprigg's time to qualify for his office until March 5 of that year.|$|E
5|$|Clements began <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> {{re-election}} in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E

5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Cordray has the {{distinction}} of being an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on Jeopardy! In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. <b>His</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
