50|$|Descurainia is a genus {{of plants}} in the mustard family which are known {{commonly}} as the tansymustards. They are similar in appearance to other mustards, sending up long erect stems and bearing small yellow or whitish flowers. Many species are noxious weeds. Some species are toxic to livestock and become a nuisance when they grow in grazing fields. Plants of this genus are found worldwide in temperate regions. Descurainia sophia, (<b>flixweed</b> or herb sophia), is the type species of Descurainia.|$|E
50|$|The sandy soils {{have been}} settled by nutrient-poor grasslands of Elijah Blue Fescue and Grey Hair-grass, the pioneer {{vegetation}} of open, sunny, sandy terrain outside littoral regions. The grasses are in places rich in colourful herbs such as Breckland Thyme (Thymus serpyllum), Sheep's-bit (Jasione montana) and Carthusian Pink (Dianthus carthusianorum). In the open areas of sandy soil {{there are also}} species of flower normally found in fields of crops and on roadsides. The vegetation is also characterised by numerous warmth-loving plants such as Viper's Bugloss (Echium vulgare), <b>Flixweed</b> (Descurainia sophia) and St. Lucie Cherry (Prunus mahaleb) {{as well as many}} common subcontinental species like Hoary Alison (Berteroa incana), Field Eryngo (Eryngium campestre), Field Mugwort (Artemisia campestris), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis).The sandstone rocks themselves are lightly covered in crustose lichens.|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} beet leafhoppers in Idaho showed {{that they are}} capable of {{producing}} multiple generations within a year, with generally 3 different generations produced in Idaho in a year. The insects are active in mustard and <b>flixweed</b> plants over winter and females begin laying eggs in March. The adults from this generation mature by May when they may migrate to beet fields to mate and lay eggs for the second annual generation to be born. The third generation matures to adulthood by early September or October when these insects migrate back to their winter habitats. There is evidence that this migration may be related to seasonal temperatures as leafhoppers migrated to beet fields later during colder seasons. Researchers proposed that these later migrations can decrease damage to beet fields as the leafhoppers stay on the fields for shorter periods of time overall.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} ozone on winter wheat and <b>flixweed</b> under competition, two species were exposed to ambient, elevated and high [O 3] for 30 days, planted singly or in mixculture. Eco-physiological responses were examined at different [O 3] and fumigating time. Ozone reduced the contents of chlorophyll, increased the accumulation of H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde in both wheat and <b>flixweed.</b> The effects of competition on chlorophyll content of wheat emerged at elevated and high [O 3], while that of <b>flixweed</b> emerged only at high [O 3]. The increase of H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde of <b>flixweed</b> was {{less than that of}} wheat under the same condition. Antioxidant enzyme activities of wheat and <b>flixweed</b> were seriously depressed by perennial and serious treatment using O 3. However, short-term and moderate fumigation increased the activities of SOD and POD of wheat, and CAT of <b>flixweed.</b> The expression levels of antioxidant enzymes related genes provided explanation for these results. Furthermore, the increase of CAT expression of <b>flixweed</b> was much higher than that of SOD and POD expression of wheat. Ozone and competition resulted in significant reductions in biomass and grain yield in both winter wheat and <b>flixweed.</b> However, the negative effects on <b>flixweed</b> were less than wheat. Our results demonstrated that winter wheat is more sensitive to O 3 and competition than <b>flixweed,</b> providing valuable data for further investigation on responses of winter wheat to ozone pollution, in particular combined with species competition...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flixweed</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} weeds in North America and China, and causes a reduction in crop yields. Dormancy of <b>flixweed</b> seeds is deep at maturity and is maintained in soil for several months. To identify regulators of seed dormancy and germination of <b>flixweed,</b> the effect of environmental and hormonal signals were examined using dormant and non-dormant seeds. The level of dormancy was decreased during after-ripening and stratification, but long imbibition (over 5 days) at 4 C in the dark resulted in the introduction of secondary dormancy. The strict requirement of duration of cold treatment for the break of dormancy may play a role in the seasonal regulation of germination. The germination of non-dormant <b>flixweed</b> seeds was critically regulated by red (R) and far-red (FR) light in a photoreversible manner. Sodium nitroprusside, a donor of nitric oxide (NO), promoted germination of half-dormant seeds, suggesting that NO reduced the level of seed dormancy. As has been shown in other related species, light elevated sensitivity to GA 4 in dark-imbibied <b>flixweed</b> seeds, but cold treatment did not affect GA 4 -sensitivity unlike in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our results indicate that seed germination in <b>flixweed</b> and its close relative Arabidopsis is controlled by similar as well as distinct mechanisms in response to various endogenous and environmental signals...|$|E
40|$|Background: Owning to {{therapeutic}} properties, <b>flixweed</b> and {{marsh mallow}} {{have traditionally been}} very important in Iran. In this research study the effect of various concentrations of ethanol <b>flixweed</b> seed and marsh mallow root extracts, collected from different areas of Iran, was studied on Streptococcus pyogenes; {{the effect of the}} extract with antibiotics of penicillin, erythromycin and amoxicillin was compared in a completely randomized design with four replications. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, discs impregnated with concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250 mg/mL were prepared from ethanol extract of <b>flixweed</b> concentration in Jiroft, Baghin, Rafsanjan and Kohbanan as well as marsh mallow root extract in Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd and Kerman. Then, they were placed on culture medium of blood agar that S. pyogenes has grown on. Finally, inhibitory effect was evaluated. Results: The results showed that, among different areas and available antibiotics, the highest inhibition zone was related to marsh mallow root extract of Yazd in concentration of 250 mg/mL with 14. 5 mm. Beta hemolysis was observed on concentrations of 50, 100 and 250 mg/mL of <b>flixweed</b> seed extracts in all areas; thus, these concentrations are not suitable for producing herbal medicine.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Because of {{cold weather}} and {{extremely}} harsh environment, there is few exotic species in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Plateau zo-kor (Myospalax fontanierii), dominant borrowing small mammal, {{plays a role}} as ‘ecosystem engineer’ in alpine meadow ecosystem. We measured and compared the dispersion area, branches, height and number of branches of <b>flixweed</b> tansymus-tard (Descurainia sophia) on the area disturbed by zokor mounds and in the undisturbed alpine meadow. <b>Flixweed</b> tansymustard is cool-season annual or biennial typical farmland weed in Chi-na, and is not found in alpine meadow before. The results indicated that zokor mounds significantly increased the dispersion area, number of individ-uals in each dispersion area, height and number of branches of <b>flixweed</b> tansymustard on the area disturbed by zokor mounds compared to those in undisturbed alpine meadow. These results suggest that ecosystem engineering by native species of rodent could promote the invasions of alien plant species in alpine meadow ecosystem, leading to higher abundances of invaders...|$|E

All experiments conducted in laboratory of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad during 2010. The {{results showed that the}} seeds and leaves aqueous extracts of eucalyptus at all concentrations had inhibitory effects on final germination percentage and germination rate of both species. The inhibitory effects enhanced as the extract concentration increased. The shoot and root lengths and fresh and dry weights were greatly reduced in <b>flixweed</b> than in barley. Similarly, chlorophyll a and b and total chlorophyll contents were decreased in leaf of barley and <b>flixweed</b> In both species, accumulation of proline and soluble sugars amounts increased, it seems that this is an adjustment mechanism for ameliorate of stress tolerance.

40|$|Introduction <b>Flixweed</b> (Descurainia sophia L.) is a {{medicinal}} plant from Brassicaceae family which {{also known as}} a weed for winter cereals and oil seed rape. Low temperatures {{are one of the most}} important abiotic stresses that threat <b>Flixweed</b> growth and productivity. Therefore it is important to recognize the freeze tolerance of <b>Flixweed</b> for successful planting and utilization in cold regions such as Mashhad in Khorasan Razavi Province (Iran’s north. east). Among many laboratory methods which have been developed to estimate and to evaluate plants response or their tolerance to freez¬ing temperatures, electrolyte leakage (EL) test is widely used. This test is based on this principle that damage to the cell membranes results in enhanced leakage of solutes into the apoplastic water, hence recording the amount of leakage after stress treatments provides an estimation of tissue injury. Indeed continuing integration of plasma membrane is one important factor for survival of plants under freezing stress and any disturbance in membrane structure can lead to damage and death. So determination of LT 50 point or critical temperature for electrolytes leakage and survival of plant is the most reliable, quantitative and simple methods for evaluating the cold tolerance of plants. The aim of this trial was to determine the LT 50 according to the EL and SU...|$|E

Herbicides included pyroxsulam at 18. 4 g ai ha− 1, propoxycarbazone-Na at 44 g ai ha− 1, premixed propoxycarbazone-Na & mesosulfuron-methyl at 27 g ai ha− 1, and sulfosulfuron at 35 g ai ha− 1. The herbicides were applied postemergence in fall and spring seasons. Averaged over time of application, no herbicide controlled downy brome more than 78 % in any year. When downy brome densities were high, control was less than 60 %. Pyroxsulam controlled downy brome greater than or similar to other herbicides tested. <b>Flixweed</b> (Descurainia sophia L.), blue mustard [Chorispora tenella (Pallas) DC. ], and henbit (Lamium amplexicaule L.) control did not differ among herbicide treatments. All herbicides tested controlled <b>flixweed</b> and blue mustard at least 87 % and 94 %, respectively. However, none of the herbicides controlled henbit more than 73 %. Fall herbicide applications improved weed control compared to early spring applications; improvement ranged from 3 % to 31 % depending on the weed species. Henbit control was greatly decreased by delaying herbicide applications until spring compared to fall applications (49 % vs. 80 % control). Herbicide injury was observed in only two instances.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyPhillip W. StahlmanSaflufenacil is an {{experimental}} herbicide {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds in various crops including several herbicide resistant weed biotypes. Wheat is highly tolerant to preplant and preemergence applications of saflufenacil, but winter wheat growers prefer to apply herbicides postemergence (POST) in early spring. Objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate winter wheat and four common broadleaf weed species response to POST treatments of saflufenacil applied alone and in combination with bentazon or auxin herbicides at various rates both with and without adjuvants, and to (2) determine the possible mechanism(s) responsible for crop safening observed when saflufenacil is applied with 2, 4 -D amine or bentazon in winter wheat. Growth chamber, greenhouse, and field studies showed saflufenacil at a minimum rate of 25 g/ha controlled blue mustard and <b>flixweed</b> > 85 % when saflufenacil was applied alone or mixed with dicamba, 2, 4 -D amine, 2, 4 -D ester, or MCPA ester. Also, mixtures of bentazon with 13 g/ha of saflufenacil resulted in death of kochia, but increasingly higher rates of 2, 4 -D amine were needed to achieve 90 % growth reduction when saflufenacil rates were decreased from 50 to 25 to 13 g/ha. In general, most of the saflufenacil combinations tested controlled henbit < 85 %. Leaf necrosis and stunting of winter wheat were reduced by tank mixing saflufenacil with dicamba, 2, 4 -D amine, or bentazon, but not with MCPA ester or 2, 4 -D ester. Including nonionic surfactant (NIS) in mixtures of saflufenacil plus 2, 4 -D amine resulted in significant wheat injury similar or greater than injury caused by saflufenacil plus NIS. Finally, 2, 4 -D amine enhanced saflufenacil absorption into winter wheat plants, whereas bentazon reduced absorption of saflufenacil. No more than 11 % of applied saflufenacil translocated out of treated leaves to other plant parts when applied alone or when saflufenacil was mixed with 2, 4 -D amine or bentazon. Metabolism of saflufenacil by wheat plants was not affected by tank mixing with bentazon, but saflufenacil metabolism was slowed by mixing with 2, 4 -D amine. Overall, these studies indicate saflufenacil can potentially be used POST in wheat at an optimum rate of 25 g/ha plus 2, 4 -D amine or dicamba to effectively control blue mustard and <b>flixweed...</b>|$|E

Three Lygus species, L. elisus, L. hesperus, L. lineolaris, were commonly found in cultivated crops and non-cultivated habitats based on concurrent adult collections in Colorado. Lygus species were found from early April to late in August, having multiple generations in each year in Colorado. Lygus species had wide host range in Colorado. Alfalfa was a significant host plant for Lygus species. However, after cutting alfalfa, Lygus species moved to adjacent crops, i. e. canola and caused significant injury during early flower and pod stages. The wild mustards, <b>flixweed,</b> D. sophia L. and tansy mustard, D. pinnata (Walt.), were significantly important host plants in non-cultivated areas and within cultivated crops.

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades acetolactate synthase (ALS) {{inhibiting}} herbicides have been the major weed control tools in winter wheat which resulted in selection of resistant weeds to those herbicides. Premix of pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil (Huskie®), a relatively new herbicide, was registered for use in wheat in 2008. Pyrasulfotole inhibits 4 -hydoxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) enzyme in susceptible plants and is the first significant new mode of action for use in cereals for {{more than two}} decades. Field experiments were conducted from 2007 to 2010 at two locations in Kansas, USA to test the efficacy of pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil for broadleaf weed control and crop safety in winter wheat. Treatments included pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil alone at 253 g·ai·ha- 1 and tank mixtures of pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil at 207 g·ai·ha- 1 with MCPA at 280 g·ai·ha- 1 , dicamba at 140 g·ai·ha- 1 or metsulfuron-methyl at 4. 2 g·ai·ha- 1 . Herbicides were applied postemergence in fall and spring seasons. Pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil alone or in combination with tank-mix partners, regardless of application time, controlled <b>flixweed,</b> blue mustard, bushy wallflower and field pennycress 98 % or more. Henbit control was better when pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil treatments were applied in fall than spring (≥ 98 % vs ≥ 67 %). Pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil alone applied in spring was not effective on wild buckwheat, but tank mixing with dicamba or metsulfuron-methyl controlled it 84 % or more. Pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil alone or as tank mixture caused little (≤ 7 %) or no injury to wheat and the injury did not influence wheat grain yields. Based on excellent control of broadleaf weeds evaluated, pyrasulfotole & bromoxynil is an alternative tool to control ALS-inhibitor resistant weeds in winter wheat.

40|$|No-tillage (NT) {{can provide}} both {{environmental}} and economic benefits and has been recognized as a sustainable land use practice in many areas worldwide. NT has induced some concerns in the North China Plain (NCP), e. g. unstable crop yield and fodder shortage, {{with regards to the}} amount of crop residues retained on the soil surface. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore whether or not manure inputs are a viable alternative to crop residue in no-till wheat and maize rotation systems in NCP. Field experiments were initiated in October 2004 including three management operations: conventional tillage with residue removed (CTr), NT with crop residue left on soil surface (NTc), and NT with manure inputs (NTm); and two fertilizer application practices: splitting fertilizer inputs (SF) and concentrated fertilizer inputs (CF). These treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design, with three replications, and continued over a 4 -year period. Crop yield, soil properties and weed population were measured in a wheat-maize double crop system. Compared to CTr, NT had a trend of reducing wheat biomass and grain yield which reduced by 4 % and 6 %, respectively, for NTc, and 5 % and 4 %, respectively, for NTm. Tillage treatments, thus use of manure instead of residue, had no significant effects on maize biomass and yield. Fertilizer application practices had no significant effects on biomass and yield of both crops. Continuous NT for 4 years significantly increased the bulk density, soil water content, soil organic carbon (SOC) of the surface soil, but decreased the soil electrical conductivity (EC). The increase in SOC in NTm was higher than in NTc. Although soil EC decreased less in NTm than in NTc, the effects of soil EC could be neglected in the study. The NTc or NTm significantly inhibited the dominant weed in wheat field. The CF inhibited the <b>flixweed</b> (Descurainia sophia) growth compared to the SF.

40|$|Descurainia sophia (<b>flixweed)</b> is {{an annual}} weed widely {{distributed}} in cultivated crops, forage and rangelands throughout the world. This weed, in particular its seed, {{is used for}} food, medicinal and industrial purposes. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of irrigation management and different application rates of nitrogen on morphological traits and yield components of this weed as a means of enhancing production and economic returns. A two-year field experiment was conducted in a semi-arid region in Iran during the 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was a split plot in a randomized complete block design with three replicates, with irrigation treatments as main plots and nitrogen rates as sub plots. The three irrigation regimes consisted of 0. 1 maximum allowable depletion or deficiency (MAD) of available soil water (ASW), 0. 2 MAD of ASW, 0. 4 MAD of ASW in 2010 and 0. 2 MAD of ASW, 0. 4 MAD of ASW and 0. 8 MAD of ASW in 2011. The plants were grown at three nitrogen rates of 0, 200, and 300 kgNha- 1. Generally there were significant increases in seed yield, biomass, straw yield, harvest index, number of siliques (pods) per plant, seed weight, plant height, time to maturity, water use efficiency, protein concentration in seed, straw N concentration, nitrogen uptakes and nitrogen harvest index each growing season by applying nitrogen at all irrigation treatments. There was a decreasing trend in number of plants per m 2, nitrogen utilization efficiency and oil concentration with increasing nitrogen application under all the irrigation treatments. Seed yield response to irrigation treatments and N rates seemed to be more related to number of plants per m 2 and number of siliques per plant. The highest seed yield was obtained at the plant population of 686 plantsperm 2. The results obtained here suggest that nitrogen application can improve the seed yield and seed quality of D. sophia grown under different irrigation regimes.
