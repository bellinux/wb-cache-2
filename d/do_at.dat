5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E

5|$|This {{effectively}} left Pistrucci {{with little}} to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> the Mint. He created several medallic works, for example a small memorial medal for the King's brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He was asked to design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George's death in 1830, but declined as {{he was asked to}} copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830–1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, and he may have concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation is}} that cometary impacts release more energy on Callisto and Ganymede than they <b>do</b> <b>at</b> Titan due to the higher gravitational field of Jupiter. That could erode the atmospheres of Callisto and Ganymede, whereas the cometary material would actually build Titan's atmosphere. However, the 2H–1H (i.e. D–H) ratio of Titan's atmosphere is , nearly 1.5 times {{lower than that of}} comets. The difference suggests that cometary material is unlikely to be the major contributor to Titan's atmosphere.|$|E

College teams which produce a large quantity of NFL prospects generally generate huge interest from scouts and coaches at their Pro Days.|$|E
