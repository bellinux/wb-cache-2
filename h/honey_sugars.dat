40|$|International audienceThe {{control of}} the floral quality of honey has become a {{priority}} issue {{as a result of}} the number of abuses observed and the relative ease of getting around existing control methods. We conducted chromatographic analyses of <b>honey</b> <b>sugars</b> to determine new criteria for authenticating an origin. The work involved creating databases by analysing a large number of authentic honeys from seven monofloral varieties, followed by statistical processing of the results by a principal components analysis. Differences in composition could thus be demonstrated, such as the presence of trisaccharides in fir honey, that provide an additional tool for authenticating unknow commercial honeys...|$|E
40|$|Bees need wax as {{construction}} material for their combs. They produce {{it in their}} wax glands, which are fully developed in 12 to 18 days old workers. In older bees the wax glands diminish their activity. However in emergency situations wax-synthesis can be reactivated. Greatest quantities of wax are produced during the growth phase of bee colonies, under moderate climate conditions during April to June. A bibliography on the synthesis of beeswax is given in the monograph of Hepburn 12. The main raw materials for wax formation are carbohydrates, i. e. the <b>honey</b> <b>sugars</b> fructose, glucose and sucrose 45. The ratio of sugar to wax can vary from 3 to 30 : 1, a ratio of around 20 : 1 being typical for central Europe 45. The stronger the colony, the smaller the ratio, the more economical the wax production for the colony. One Langstroth frame, containing only 100 g of wax can hold 2 - 4 kg of honey. Wax production and comb construction activity in the bee colony are determined by following factors: • Nectar flow: the greater the flow, the more combs are needed for storage. • Brood rearing (egg laying) : the more eggs are layed, the more comb cells are needed. • The presence of a queen: only colonies with a queen build combs. • Temperature: temperatures higher than 15 ° C favour comb building activity • The presence of pollen as a protein sourc...|$|E

40|$|The major {{compounds}} in honey are carbohydrates such as monosaccharides and disaccharides. The same compounds {{are found in}} cane-sugar concentrates. Unfortunately when sugar concentrate is added to honey, laboratory assessments {{are found to be}} ineffective in detecting this adulteration. Unlike tracing heavy metals in <b>honey,</b> <b>sugar</b> adulterated <b>honey</b> is much trickier and harder to detect, and traditionally it has been very challenging {{to come up with a}} suitable method to prove the presence of adulterants in honey products. This paper proposes a combination of array sensing and multi-modality sensor fusion that can effectively discriminate the samples not only based on the compounds present in the sample but also mimic the way humans perceive flavours and aromas. Conversely, analytical instruments are based on chemical separations which may alter the properties of the volatiles or flavours of a particular honey. The present work is focused on classifying 18 samples of different <b>honeys,</b> <b>sugar</b> syrups and adulterated samples using data fusion of electronic nose (e-nose) and electronic tongue (e-tongue) measurements. Each group of samples was evaluated separately by the e-nose and e-tongue. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were able to separately discriminate monofloral <b>honey</b> from <b>sugar</b> syrup, and polyfloral <b>honey</b> from <b>sugar</b> and adulterated samples using the e-nose and e-tongue. The e-nose was observed to give better separation compared to e-tongue assessment, particularly when LDA was applied. However, when all samples were combined in one classification analysis, neither PCA nor LDA were able to discriminate between honeys of different floral origins, sugar syrup and adulterated samples. By applying a sensor fusion technique, the classification for the 18 different samples was improved. Significant improvement was observed using PCA, while LDA not only improved the discrimination but also gave better classification. An improvement in performance was also observed using a Probabilistic Neural Network classifier when the e-nose and e-tongue data were fused...|$|R
