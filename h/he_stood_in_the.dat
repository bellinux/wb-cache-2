5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circle, he had two thoughts: that people would {{be talking about this}} in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Nabis had {{appointed}} his brother-in-law, the Argive Pythagoras, {{as commander}} of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted {{to stir up}} a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's agora and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them to rise in revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles {{and most of his}} followers were surrounded and killed by the Spartan garrison.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E

Powell said that he had “left his visiting card”, i.e. demonstrated himself to be a potential future leader, but the immediate effect was to demonstrate his limited support in the Parliamentary Party, enabling Heath to feel more comfortable calling his bluff.|$|E
