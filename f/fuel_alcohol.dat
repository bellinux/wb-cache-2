40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{was developed to}} evaluate the effect of <b>fuel</b> <b>alcohols</b> present in reformulated gasoline on BTEX natural attenuation and groundwater plume elongation. The model, developed as a module for the RT 3 D (Reactive Transport in 3 -Dimensions) model, includes commonly considered fate and transport processes (advection, dispersion, adsorption, biodegradation and depletion of electron acceptors during biodegradation) and substrate interactions previously not considered (e. g., {{a decrease in the}} specific benzene utilization rate due to metabolic flux dilution and/or catabolite repression) as well as microbial populations shifts, cosolvency effects, alcohol toxicity and source zone depletion dynamics that affect groundwater concentrations of gasoline constituents. The model was used to (1) evaluate the relative importance of benzene plume-elongation mechanisms, (2) how the concentration of ethanol in reformulated gasoline affects the length and longevity of benzene plumes, and (3) the effects of five <b>fuel</b> <b>alcohols</b> (methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, iso-butanol and n-butanol) on the natural attenuation of benzene in fuel contaminated groundwater. Model simulations showed that all <b>fuel</b> <b>alcohols</b> can hinder the natural attenuation of benzene, due mainly to accelerated depletion of dissolved oxygen during their biodegradation (leading to strongly anaerobic methanogenic conditions) and a decrease in the specific degradation rate for benzene (due to catabolite repression and metabolic flux dilution). Thus, releases of alcohol-blended gasoline should result in longer benzene plumes compared to regular gasoline. However, the simulated lifespan of benzene plumes was shorter for blends with higher alcohol contents, due to a lower mass of benzene released, and increased microbial activity associated with fortuitous growth of BTEX degraders on <b>fuel</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Benzene plume elongation and longevity were more pronounced in the presence of alcohols that biodegrade slower (e. g., propanol and n-butanol), forming longer and more persistent alcohol plumes. In general, our model indicates that higher alcohols blends have a lower impact on BTEX natural attenuation, while more recalcitrant alcohols have a higher impact. Thus, E 85 (85 % Ethanol) had the lowest impact on BTEX plume elongation and B 10 (10 % n-Butanol) had the highest impact. However, simulations were highly sensitive to site-specific biokinetic coefficients for alcohol degradation, which forewarns against generalizations about the level of impact of specific <b>fuel</b> <b>alcohols</b> on benzene plume dynamics, and calls for further pilot-scale and field research to validate the assumptions and results from this model...|$|R

First sold in 1925, Trangia stoves were initially preferred to kerosene (paraffin) pressure stoves because they required only one type of <b>fuel</b> (<b>alcohol,</b> usually in the form of methylated spirit).

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines can be configured {{to run on}} many kinds of fuel, including gasoline, kerosene, tractor vaporizing oil (TVO), vegetable oil, diesel fuel, biodiesel, ethanol <b>fuel</b> (<b>alcohol),</b> and others. Multifuel engines, such as petrol-paraffin engines, can benefit from an initial vaporization of the fuel when they are running less volatile fuels. For this purpose, a vaporizer (or vaporiser) {{is placed in the}} intake system. The vaporizer uses heat from the exhaust manifold to vaporize the fuel. For example, the original Fordson tractor and various subsequent Fordson models had vaporizers. When Henry Ford & Son Inc designed the original Fordson (1916), the vaporizer was used to provide for kerosene operation. When TVO became common in various countries (including the United Kingdom and Australia) in the 1940s and 1950s, the standard vaporizers on Fordson models were equally useful for TVO. Widespread adoption of diesel engines in tractors made the use of tractor vaporizing oil obsolete.|$|E
50|$|The {{system can}} be fail-safe. If an {{electrical}} fault opens, the electrical circuit causes the indicator to show the tank as being empty (theoretically provoking the driver to refill the tank) rather than full (which would allow the driver {{to run out of}} fuel with no prior notification). Corrosion or wear of the potentiometer will provide erroneous readings of fuel level. However, this system has a potential risk associated with it. An electric current is sent through the variable resistor to which a float is connected, so that the value of resistance depends on the fuel level. In most automotive fuel gauges such resistors are on the inward side of the gauge, i.e., inside the fuel tank. Sending current through such a resistor has a fire hazard and an explosion risk associated with it. These resistance sensors are also showing an increased failure rate with the incremental additions of alcohol in automotive gasoline <b>fuel.</b> <b>Alcohol</b> increases the corrosion rate at the potentiometer, as it is capable of carrying current like water. Potentiometer applications for alcohol fuel use a pulse-and-hold methodology, with a periodic signal being sent to determine fuel level decreasing the corrosion potential. Therefore, demand for another safer, non-contact method for fuel level is desired.|$|E

30|$|The proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) {{has emerged as}} a promising electrical energy supply for portable, vehicular, and stationary applications. It is known that high PEMFC performance is achieved when fed with pure hydrogen fuel. However, due to problems associated with hydrogen production, handling, storage, and distribution, it becomes necessary the search for alternative fuels. In this context, liquid fuels, such as methanol and ethanol, have been explored as possible candidates. Such <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> can be directly fed in PEMFC and the power density is provided by the direct alcohol oxidation, being so-called Direct <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Fuel</b> Cell (DAFC) [1]. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells that use either hydrogen or <b>alcohol</b> as <b>fuels</b> are promising power sources for transportation and portable power [1].
