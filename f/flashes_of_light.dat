5|$|The shells {{are made}} of cast iron, {{as large as a}} bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of an {{appearance}} of sudden <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> or floaters, an eye doctor needs to be consulted immediately. A shower of floaters or any loss of vision, too, is a medical emergency.|$|E

25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} is {{a disorder}} {{of the eye}} in which the retina separates from the layer underneath. Symptoms include {{an increase in the number}} of floaters, <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and worsening of the outer part of the visual field. This may be described as a curtain over part of the field of vision. In about 7% of cases both eyes are affected. Without treatment permanent loss of vision may occur.|$|E
25|$|The strobe light, {{commonly}} called a strobe, is a device {{used to produce}} regular <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Modern uses of strobe lights serve a purpose for safety warning, and motion detection. Strobes can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope {{for the study of}} moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.|$|E
25|$|A final {{discovery}} {{occurred during}} the last two orbits of the mission. When the spacecraft passed the orbit of Jupiter's moon Amalthea, the star scanner detected unexpected <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that were reflections from moonlets. None of the individual moonlets were reliably sighted twice, hence no orbits were determined and the moonlets did not meet the International Astronomical Union requirements to receive designations. It is believed that these moonlets most likely are debris ejected from Amalthea and form a tenuous, and perhaps temporary, ring.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, Ware built a small machine out of old radar {{equipment}} {{and was able}} to induce powerful currents. When they did, the plasma gave off <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> but he could not devise a way to measure the temperature of the plasma. Thomson continued to pressure the government to allow him to build a full-scale device, using his considerable political currency to argue {{for the creation of a}} dedicated experimental station at the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) lab that had recently been constructed at Aldermaston.|$|E
25|$|Iridium Communications Inc. (formerly Iridium Satellite LLC) is a {{publicly}} traded American company headquartered in McLean, Virginia. Iridium operates the Iridium satellite constellation, a system of 66 active satellites used for worldwide voice and data communication from hand-held satellite phones and other transceiver units. The Iridium network is unique in that it covers the whole Earth, including poles, oceans and airways, with 95 satellites launched so far. The satellites are frequently visible {{in the night sky}} as satellite flares, a phenomenon typically observed as short-lived bright <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|For the {{observer}} {{standing on the}} platform, on the other hand, {{the rear of the}} traincar is moving (catching up) toward {{the point at which the}} flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is finite and the same in all directions for all observers, the light headed for the back of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> will strike the ends of the traincar at different times.|$|E

25|$|Photoinhibition {{can also}} be induced with short <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> using either a pulsed laser or a xenon flash lamp. When very short flashes are used, the photoinhibitory {{efficiency}} of the flashes depends on the time difference between the flashes. This dependence has been interpreted {{to indicate that the}} flashes cause photoinhibition by inducing recombination reactions in PSII, with subsequent production of singlet oxygen. The interpretation has been criticized by noting that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon flashes depends on the energy of the flashes even if such strong flashes are used that they would saturate the formation of the substrate of the recombination reactions.|$|E
25|$|Before {{using the}} laser, the {{ophthalmologist}} dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind {{the eye to}} reduce discomfort. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens on the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient will see <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> These flashes often create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive {{for a few hours}} while the pupils are still dilated. Vision will most likely remain blurry {{for the rest of the}} day. Though there should not be much pain in the eye itself, an ice-cream headache like pain may last for hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston {{exhibited}} …Out of Here: The Veterans Project. The multimedia installation, {{which ran}} from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled {{a dark and}} empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with <b>flashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> simulating {{the experience of a}} mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with the bustle of traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children’s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).|$|E
