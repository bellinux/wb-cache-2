2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{standing}} at my side. I felt her hand laid upon my shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{on to the}} drawing-room sofa,' said Maude. 'I {{could have}} my supper, if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was safe upon the sofa.' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was fair.|$|R
60|$|The {{scene was}} beyond his describing. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> kissed him good-bye.|$|R
60|$|THIRD PAGE. Fie on her dropsy, so {{she have}} a dropsy! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was ever sweet to me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had passed}} through a fiery sea of suffering, and I kept back the anger which {{threatened}} me. I pointed upwards.|$|E
60|$|As I {{heard her}} {{close the door}} of her mother's room, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would first pray before the shrine of the little Virgin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I religiously believe it," [...] {{rejoined the}} sculptor; [...] "and yet my mind {{would be the}} easier, if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{returned}} safely to her tower." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> lives!' and Diane {{once more}} sank {{at his feet}} a trembling, shrinking, annihilated heap of shame and misery.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the match}} be broken off, I {{will take care}} that you shall hear it. I will write to Janet Fenwick. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know <b>she</b> didn't. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> HAD {{to do it}} {{just the}} same as if Miss Gage had driven her at the point of the bayonet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do {{you know}} that your smile is crooked?” I asked him; for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> must attend him, and I wished to save her as much as possible.|$|E
60|$|She said they, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did {{not expect}} poor old Hasketh really to count in the matter, any more than she {{expected}} me to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{neither did}} I think that: my niece, I felt sure, was safe from danger. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would do nothing}} that would bring either her or me to shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{will not}} forget my mother? I forgive her, if I have any cause. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> forgives me, and is sorry in her heart. You will not forget her?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{even in that}} case, I don't see why {{you should}} mind it. It was {{certainly}} very friendly of her, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has your interest at heart entirely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{more than}} you suppose. Come, Miss Lind, let us {{understand}} one another. Your family want your cousin to marry Lady Constance. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>She</b> does not object. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> too. He does." ...|$|R
60|$|After this I said no more, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{meant to}} warn me. We had entered on this {{business}} and must {{see it through}} to its end, sweet or bitter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I liked it, Mr. Paret," [...] {{she replied}} simply, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had understated. It was quite {{apparent}} that Krebs had captivated her. I {{tried not to}} betray my annoyance.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} my mental remarks ceased, for I observed, to my surprise, that Eve opened a small book, {{and from the}} {{continuous}} tone of her voice, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was reading.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never asked. I hate gossiping, and I make a rule {{to inquire}} into no secrets but such as are voluntarily confided to me; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has never told Sabina." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> {{not being}} told some {{story of my}} {{abandonment}} of her? How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> she isn't being led to believe I no longer want {{her to come to}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think that}} it will be for any good," [...] said Mrs. Trevelyan; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may be trusted. And I suppose it ought to be so, if you wish it." ...|$|R
60|$|I, too, crept {{nearer to}} it.--About a yard away {{there was a}} {{projection}} of the front. I stole into the deep corner and waited. A few feet from me <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> too was waiting.|$|E
60|$|I waited anxiously {{for some}} reply. The worst was now out, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had heard of}} it before; but it was {{impossible}} for me to go on with my narrative without some shadow of encouragement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{indifferent}} as to {{the money}} matters of other people, sir. I {{had no intention of}} marrying Miss Waddington for her money before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was your granddaughter; nor have I now that I do know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knights, she is your cousin, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{as surely}} as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is my niece. Tell me now, is she aught more to you?" [...] and he searched them with those {{piercing}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Trefoil {{is quite}} welcome," [...] said Sir John. [...] "It isn't a bad idea. Perhaps she may carry a lady, {{because she has}} never been tried. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> objects {{strongly}} to carry a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{why do so}} {{many people}} talk of her as though she had {{committed}} a great crime? Miss Furnival, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is innocent. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it as surely as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the fact of my own existence--" ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not disturb}} her. The minutes passed, the light waned until I {{could see her}} no longer, and yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had not moved. The strange sympathy between us kept me silent until I heard her voice calling my name.|$|E
6000|$|... "She had {{not done}} so when she last wrote. I {{mentioned}} it to her the other day, before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had left Paris. If my letters and her sister's letters have been sent on to her, she must know it now." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not {{complain}} and she seldom showed {{her sense of}} discomfort. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> longed for the friends and neighbors she had left behind, and yet so far {{from being able to}} help her I was even then planning to leave her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had not {{formulated}} {{it in my}} mind," [...] said Miriam. [...] "Will {{you take}} her with you to-day? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has {{made up her mind}} she cannot wait any longer for the doctor to come." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY TEAZLE. No indeed--I {{have not}} opinion enough {{of her to}} be taught by her, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has lately rais'd many scandalous hints of me--which you know one always hears from one common Friend, or other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor is {{it about}} the house. You might have the house and welcome. But how can I give up my charge over your sister just when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is {{disposed}} to do just what she ought not." ...|$|R
