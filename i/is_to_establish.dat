5|$|In 2014, a {{team from}} the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} a study in a short, double track section of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated almost two metres beneath. The study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> how the original cast-iron lining sections, which {{are similar to those}} used for many miles of railway under London, resist possible deformation and soil movement caused by the developments.|$|E
5|$|The {{process begins}} with the Multiple Property Documentation Form, which acts as a cover {{document}} rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The purpose of the documentation form <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information of the Multiple Property Documentation Form {{can be used to}} nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously, or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over time.|$|E

5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the stewardship of the country's flora. Scottish Natural Heritage is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of their duties <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are {{restricted}} to transmitting only certain video formats, defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself. HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit); any formats that are {{not supported by the}} HDMI Specification (i.e. no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Although successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), the added support <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish what formats are and aren't permitted, and video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be displayed.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, an {{agreement}} was signed {{to establish a}} Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology in Manama {{under the auspices of}} UNESCO. The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a knowledge hub for the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In March 2012, the centre hosted two high-level workshops on ICTs and education. In 2013, Bahrain topped the Arab world for internet penetration (90% of the population), trailed by the United Arab Emirates (86%) and Qatar (85%). Just half of Bahrainis and Qataris (53%) and two-thirds of those in the United Arab Emirates (64%) had access in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{main source}} from which S.thiersii derives its carbon is the {{cellulose}} of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat. The enzymes that degrade cellulose are homologous to the enzymes used by ectomycorrhizal fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In {{an attempt to}} identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the United States Department of Energy and University of Wisconsin are jointly working to sequence the S. thiersii genome and to compare it with that of Amanita bisporigera, a species which forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree and which has already been partly sequenced. They hope {{to better understand the}} genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> whether the enzymes used by S. thiersii to degrade cellulose can be cost-effectively used in the conversion of crop residues into biofuels. S.thiersii seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide clues as to how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} forms of validity. Criterion-related validity can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected {{at the same time as}} the measure being validated the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> concurrent validity; when the criterion is collected later the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> predictive validity. A measure has construct validity if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. Content validity is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a job analysis.|$|E
