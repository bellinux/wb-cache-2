The results of both tasks showed that recognition performance was better for faces rotated about yaw compared to pitch.

40|$|Measurements of hydrodynamics, local tube {{erosion and}} local {{instantaneous}} bed-to-tube heat transfer {{were carried out}} in a cold, pressurized, fluidized bed with different horizontal tube banks. The influence of pressure, fluidization velocity, particle size and tube-bank geometry was studied. Two size distributions of silica sand were used, one with a mean particle diameter of d p = 0. 45 mm and one with d p = 0. 70 mm. The hydrodynamics were also studied without tubes in the bed for the silica sand with d p = 0. 45 mm, and comparisons were made with previous results obtained with particles of dp = 0. 70 mm. The bed has a cross-section of 0. 2 m x 0. 3 m and was operated at pressures between 0. 1 and 1. 6 MPa and at excess gas velocities of 0. 2 and 0. 6 m/s. The hydrodynamics was measured using capacitance probes and Pitot-static pressure probes. The bed expansion ratio was determined by pressure drop measurements. The fluctuations in the pressure drop over the entire bed height were also measured, and the power spectral density distributions of these fluctuations were calculated. The erosion tests were carried out at different locations within the tube banks using target tubes coated with {{a thin layer of}} stearin. The bed-to-tube heat transfer was measured at a position in the tube bank near the centre line of the bed using a heat-flux sensor-equipped tube. At corresponding operating conditions, the tube bank with the most dense <b>horizontal</b> <b>pitch</b> gives rise to considerably less erosion, but also somewhat lower heat transfer, than the tube banks with a more sparse <b>horizontal</b> <b>pitch.</b> The tube erosion is strongly related to the bubble rise velocity. The heat transfer coefficient is generally coupled to the bubble frequency, except for the high excess gas velocity with the most dense <b>horizontal</b> <b>pitch</b> where, at high pressures, the bed assumes a strongly turbulent behaviour and no distinct bubble pattern exists. The results indicate that the most severe erosion will occur in sparsely packed parts of a tube bank. For the sparse tube bank investigated, at high pressures, the erosion decreases with increasing pressure. The bed-to-tube heat transfer coefficient generally increases with increasing pressure. Thus, it should be favourable to operate a bed at high pressure levels. Results obtained without tubes in the bed show that the bed expansion, bubble rise velocity, bubble volume fraction and visible bubble flow rate fall on single curves, if plotted vs a dimensionless available drag force. This drag force is a suitable scaling parameter as long as the particles do not respond to the gas phase velocity fluctuations {{and as long as the}} dense phase does not expand. An increased gas-particle interaction at high pressures, in combination with turbulent fluctuations in the gas phase, might explain the increased instability of bubbles, with a corresponding increased bubble splitting and dense phase expansion at high pressures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of parametric analyses of the yielding moment (My) of Bolted Flush Endplate Beam (BFEB) splice connections using Finite Element Modeling (FEM) tools. The connection components were modeled using three-dimensional brick elements, while contact between the endplates was modeled using Coulomb friction. Materials for beam, endplate and bolts were considered to behave non-linearly. Finite element results with three experimental and numerical studies were compared, and all indicated good agreement, which is also briefly reviewed in this paper. Using verified FEM, fairly large parametric studies, based on the practical configuration of BFEB connections, were carried out to investigate the yielding moments with variations in size of beam flange, beam web, thickness of endplate, and diameter, as well as vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>pitch,</b> of bolts. Finally, the investigation results are summarized to access the prediction equations for My as functions of geometric variables of the BFEB connections. Due to the multitude of influencing parameters, the objective parameters have been normalized by using the prediction of theoretical models, which is established upon the component method presented. The method for accuracy in predicting values, regarding the My of a BFEB connection, is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results on}} the hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics of single-phase water flows inside microchannels (MCs) with different micropin fin (MPF) configurations. Different inline arrangements of micropin fins were considered over Reynolds numbers ranging from 20 to 160. The computational studies were performed using the commercial software ansys 14. 5. The hydrodynamic performances of the configurations were compared using two parameters, namely, pressure drop and friction factor while the comparison in their thermal and thermal-hydraulic performances were based on Nusselt number and thermal performance index (TPI). Wake-pin fin interactions were carefully analyzed through streamline patterns in different arrangements and under different flow conditions. The results showed strong dependencies of all four evaluated performance parameters on the vertical pitch ratio (ST/D). Weaker dependencies on height over diameter ratio (H/D), <b>horizontal</b> <b>pitch</b> ratio (SL/D), and minimum available area (Amin) were observed. With {{an increase in the}} Reynolds number, extension of the wake regions behind MPFs was observed to be the paramount factor in increasing pressure drop and Nusselt number. Regarding TPI, two adverse trends were observed corresponding to different ST/D ratios, while the effect of SL/D ratio was unique. For friction factors, H/D and SL/D ratios of 1 and 1. 5, respectively, led to minimum values, while different ST/D ratios are needed for each diameter size for the maximum performance. Moreover, a twofold increase in Reynolds number resulted in about 40 % decrease in friction factor in each configuration...|$|E
40|$|Previous work in {{automatic}} affect analysis (AAA) {{has emphasized}} static expressions to {{the neglect of}} the dynamics of facial movement and considered head movement only a nuisance variable to control. We investigated whether the dynamics of head and facial movements apart from specific facial expressions communicate affect in infants, an under-studied population in AAA. Age-appropriate tasks were used to elicit positive and negative affect in 31 ethnically diverse infants. 3 D head and facial movements were tracked from 2 D video. Head angles in the <b>horizontal</b> (<b>pitch),</b> vertical (yaw), and lateral (roll) directions were used to measure head movement; and the 3 D coordinates of 49 facial points to measure facial movements. Strong effects were found for both head and facial movements. Angular velocity and angular acceleration of head pitch, yaw, and roll were higher during negative relative to positive affect. Amplitude, velocity, and acceleration of facial movement were higher as well during negative relative to positive affect. A linear discriminant analysis using head and facial movement achieved a mean classification rate of positive and negative affect equal to 65 % (Kappa = 0. 30). Head and facial movement individually and in combination were also strongly related to observer ratings of affect intensity. Our results suggests that the dynamics of head and facial movements communicate affect at ages as young as 13 months.
