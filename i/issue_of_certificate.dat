40|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> {{masquerading}} {{against the}} SSL protocol is {{pointed out in}} [4]. In [4], various forms of server certificate masquerading are identified. It {{should also be noted}} that the attack described is a man-in-themiddle (MITM) attack that requires direct manipulation of the SSL protocol. This paper is a mirror of [4] and involves client certificate masquerading. The motivation for this paper comes from the fact that this anomaly has shown up in commercial products. It is potentially more damaging than [4] since a MITM attack is not involved and the only requirement is that the application trust a given root certificate authority (CA). The problem arises when applications use multiple roots that do not cross-certify. The problem is further exasperated since the applications themselves do not have the ability to apply external name constraints and policies. Unfortunately, the problem is a fairly well known problem within the public key infrastructure (PKI) community, but continues to persist in practice despite this knowledge. 1...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s public-key {{certificate}} issuance has involved verifying users' identities and public keys over a separate-and presumably secure-channel, {{such as in}} person or over the phone. However, {{in some cases it}} is not practical to mandate users to obtain certificates in person. Hence a means to issue certificates over insecure networks (e. g. Internet) is required. More recently, the market expectation of mobile commerce raises the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> issuance over wireless networks. The WAP Forum has defined a WAP PKI specification and the registration protocol is also a certificate issuance protocol. We describe the security concerns of protocols for public-key certificate issuance. We motivate and describe the protocols that have appeared in drafts of the SET specification and the WAP specification. In addition, we define a methodology on the exact engineering analysis of such protocols, based on the given cryptographic primitives such as public key encryption and signature schemes, shared key encryption schemes, random number generation and message authentication code schemes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the future}} it is {{expected}} that some form of public key infrastructure will be used to support critical applications such as financial transactions which require a high level of reliability, timeliness, and robustness. Current certificate management protocols are implemented on an ad hoc basis with no real guarantee as to their scalability or capability of meeting the required levels of performance. This paper examines the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> management from a transaction processing perspective, starting with the principles of transaction processing and applying them to fundamentals such as issuing certificates and CRLs, and then moving on to more advanced transaction-based operations such as the management of certificate status information across distributed and often unreliable systems. By building on the extensive body of knowledge which has been established through operating other transaction processing systems such as those used in the financial and airline industries, it is possible to create certificate management infrastructures which can provide certain guarantees which aren’t present in current ad hoc approaches. 1. Certificate Management as Transaction Processing It is envisaged that {{at some point in the}} future some form of certificate-based infrastructure will be used to provide authorisation and authentication facilities for high-value or critical transactions which are currently being carried out without the use of a PKI. These transactions are typically built on top of standard transaction processing (TP) principles which provide certain guarantees of reliability, timeliness, atomicity of transactions, and so on...|$|E
40|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> {{revocation}} {{in mobile}} ad hoc networks (MANETs) {{where there are}} no on-line access to trusted authorities is a challenging problem. In wired network environments, when certificates are to be revoked, certificate authorities (CAs) add the information regarding the certificates in question to certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and post the CRLs on accessible repositories or distribute them to relevant entities. In purely ad hoc networks, there are typically no accesses to centralized repositories or trusted authorities; therefore the conventional method of certificate revocation is not applicable. Certificate revocation {{is one of the many}} challenges faced by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Certificate revocation is the action of declaring a certificate, which has not expired, is no longer valid due to various reasons ranging from change of relationship between certificate issuer and the public key owner to compromised private keys of the associated certificate to change of information contained in the certificate. All the revoked certificates by the certificate issuer must be made available to all the end-entities, which need to verify a certificate. Many schemes have been proposed for certificate revocation; each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of these schemes, although straightforward and easy to implement, suffer when faced with the challenge of efficient distribution of certificate revocation information. In this paper we look into the use of Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) technology to effectively and efficiently distribute the revoked information...|$|E

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are generating {{much interest}} both in academia and the telecommunication industries. The principal attractions of MANETs {{are related to}} the ease with which they can be deployed due to their infrastructure-less and decentralized nature. For example, unlike other wireless networks, MANETs do not require centralized infrastructures such as base stations, and they are arguably more robust due to their avoidance of single point of failures. Interestingly, the attributes that make MANETs attractive as a network paradigm are the same phenomena that compound the challenge of designing adequate security schemes for these innovative networks. One of the challenging security problems is the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> revocation in MANETs where there are no on-line access to trusted authorities. In wired network environments, when certificates are to be revoked, certificate authorities (CAs) add the information regarding the certificates in question to certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and post the CRLs on accessible repositories or distribute them to relevant entities. In purely ad hoc networks, there are typically no access to centralized repositories or trusted authorities; therefore the conventional method of certificate revocation is not applicable. Another challenging MANET security problem is the issue of secure routing in the presence of selfish or adversarial entities which selectively drop packets they agreed to forward; and in so doing these selfish or adversarial entities can disrupt the network traffic and cause various communication problems. In this thesis, we present two security protocols we developed for addressing the above-mentioned MANET security needs. The first protocol is a decentralized certificate revocation scheme which allows the nodes within a MANET to have full control over the process of certificate revocation. The scheme is fully contained and it does not rely on any input from centralized or external entities such as trusted CAs. The second protocol is a secure MANET routing scheme we named Robust Source Routing (RSR). In addition to providing data origin authentication services and integrity checks, RSR is able to mitigate against intelligent, colluding malicious agents which selectively drop or modify packets they are required to forward...|$|E
