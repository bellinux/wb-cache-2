40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the growing}} importance of IRL {{against the background}} of a changing European society. Based on sociological research, the traditional status of the Christian religion - and the monoreligious education that normally accompanies it - <b>is</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>being</b> <b>challenged</b> by the process of secularisation and the growing plurality or religious attitudes and beliefs among people in the West. Europe has become a complex network of in fl uences that constitute the actual symbolic fi eld employed by people in their search for truth. The interest for religion is still very much alive. People are not endlessly indifferent but still hope to fi nd (religious) truth and meaning, even if this process has become much more complex today. In this context, interreligious dialogue itself becomes a religious act. The status given by a religion to other religions is of crucial importance for its ultimate credibility. In this line of thought, religious education should transcend both a purely monoreligious approach and a purely objective-comparative (multireligious) approach, and instead should cultivate in the pupils - at the very borderlands of the different religious, cultural and geo-political territories - an attitude of practising interreligious dialogue as a religious event...|$|E

Although his influ- ence was limited during his own lifetime, in later times Han Yu came to symbolize the conservative Confucian values that are often identi- fied with the traditional Chinese state. This study examines Han Yu's life and thought in an attempt to determine to what extent his later image as an ideal Confucian was or was not justified. A chapter on the historical background provides the context for Han Yu's biography, which is divided into five chap- ters. This is followed by a chapter discussing the intellectual back- ground of Han Yu's thought. Two further chapters discuss, first, the basis of Han Yu's conservative image, and, second, a number of his writings which illustrate the limits of his conservatism. Han Yu's ideas are related to the political and social circumstan- ces of his times, and it is found that while he is indeed a conservative and a Confucian, the extent of both his conservatism and his Confucian orthodoxy have been exaggerated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract By {{the late}} 1970 s, {{household}} telephone coverage grew to exceed 90 {{percent in the}} United States, and by the mid- 1980 s telephone surveying {{of the general public}} had become commonplace. Nevertheless, 20 years later, the ability of researchers to reach representative samples of the U. S. public via landline (wired) telephone surveys and gather reli-able data <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>challenged</b> for many reasons, especially those related to cell phones and the growth of the “cell phone only ” population. However, at present there exists no widely accepted set of Cell Phone Surveying “best practices ” for U. S. survey researchers to follow. Despite what some appear to believe, surveying persons reached on cell phone numbers in the United States currently is a very complex undertaking if one wants to do it “right, ” i. e. to do it legally, ethically, and in ways that optimally allocate one’s finite resources to gather the highest quality data, and to analyze and interpret those data accurately. This final “wrap-up ” article in the special issue provides a review of the empirical articles in the issue with a focus on their practical implications for the decisions that researchers need to make regarding sampling, coverage, nonresponse, measurement, and weighting in surveys that include inter-views with persons reached on cell phones.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{serotonin}} (5 -HT) deficiency {{hypothesis of}} aggression <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>challenged</b> by pharmacological data showing robust anti-aggressive effects of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists in dose ranges that concomitantly inhibit 5 -HT neurotransmission. Hence, an adequate {{interpretation of the}} role of 5 -HT activity in regulating aggression depends on elucidating the predominant site of action, i. e., raphe presynaptic autoreceptors versus forebrain postsynaptic heteroreceptors, of these 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists. OBJECTIVES: The present experiments investigated the anti-aggressive properties of the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists F 15599 that preferentially target postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A heteroreceptors in the frontal cortex and F 13714 that more preferentially activates raphe somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors. METHODS: Both 'biased' agonists were acutely administered intraperitoneally in aggressive resident male WTG rats confronting an intruder. RESULTS: Systemic administration of F 15599 and F 13714 exerted very potent (ID 50 [*]=[*] 0. 095 and 0. 0059 mg/kg, respectively) anti-aggressive effects. At 4. 5 -fold higher dose ranges, the anti-aggressive effects were accompanied by concomitant motor inactivity and/or reduction of social engagement. Pretreatment with WAY- 100635 counteracted the behavioural effects of both agonists. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the qualitatively similar but quantitatively different anti-aggressive profiles of F 15599 and F 13714 largely correspond to their distinct 5 -HT 1 A receptor binding/activation potencies. Moreover, the marked anti-aggressive potency of F 13714 adds additional support for a critical role of raphe somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors, and hence phasic 5 -HT neuron activity, in the initiation/execution of aggressive actions...|$|R
40|$|No to the Bear”: Questions of Power and Truths {{behind the}} Reintroduction of Brown Bears into the French Pyrenees At this {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, global climate and biodiversity, including human survival, <b>are</b> <b>seriously</b> threatened. Fuelled by culturally constructed anthropocentric ‘needs’, the unrelenting march of neoliberal capitalism dramatically manifests dichotomous views and discourses {{on the environment and}} sustainable development. Always complex, and often conflictual, the human-environment relationships which are constructed within this neoliberal paradigm <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>challenged.</b> If we <b>are</b> to avert potentially dangerous escalations deriving from such tensions, it is essential that environmental anthropology actively engages in the issues, and confronts the necessary cultural and environmental changes which are already becoming evident. This dissertation examines these issues in the French Pyrenees, where a conservation programme to reintroduce the brown bear <b>is</b> <b>seriously</b> impacting traditional transhumant pastoralism, already menaced by global politico-economic pressures. I explore the potential contribution of Actor- Network Theory (ANT) to the investigation of power, science, and politics by examining the opposing, generally uniform, and largely reified arguments which create a nature-culture conflict. In this way, ANT helps illuminate the otherwise heavily disguised underlying realities which exist/emerge between those who reject the bear’s reintroduction, essentially small-scale farmers and shepherds, and the supporters of the programme who generally have no coherent understanding of the techniques or needs of transhumant farming, or even of mountain life. I argue that governmentimposed systemic solutions will require a more egalitarian and accepting cultural framework which demonstrates a greater valorisation of the natural and social environment, while accepting different understandings of scientific and local truths. In short, it is essential to see through human-animal conflicts to the human-human conflicts hidden behind, and which inevitably {{get in the way of}} successful holistic natureculture futures...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{ubiquitous}} signaling molecule with a {{vast number}} of tasks in the body, including regulation of cardiovascular and metabolic function. A decreased bioavailability of NO is a central event in disorders such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome. NO is also important in the regulation of blood flow and metabolism during exercise. The production of NO has previously been thought to be under the exclusive control of the nitric oxide synthases (NOS) but this view <b>is</b> now <b>being</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>challenged.</b> Recent lines of research suggest the existence of an NO-synthase independent pathway in which the supposedly inert NO oxidation products nitrate (NO 3 -) and nitrite (NO 2 -) can be reduced back to NO in blood and tissues. An important additional source of nitrate is our everyday diet and certain vegetables are particularly rich in this anion. In this thesis the possibility that dietary derived nitrate is metabolized in vivo to form reactive nitrogen oxides with NO-like bioactivity has been explored. It is shown that nitrate in amounts easily achieved via the diet, increases the systemic levels of nitrite and reduces blood pressure in healthy humans. Moreover, nitrate reduces whole body oxygen cost during submaximal and maximal exercise; a surprising effect involving improvement in mitochondrial efficiency and reduced expression of specific mitochondrial proteins regulating proton conductance. Alterations in the mitochondrial affinity for oxygen can explain this reduction in both submaximal and maximal oxygen consumption and predicts basal metabolic rate in humans. Finally, in mice lacking endothelial NO synthase, dietary supplementation with nitrate could reverse several features of the metabolic syndrome that develop in these animals. These studies demonstrate that dietary nitrate can fuel a nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway with important implications for cardiovascular and metabolic functions in health and disease...|$|R
40|$|After the {{publication}} of Nelson and Plosser 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) influential paper, {{it has been a}} general accepted view that real output and prices are nonstationary. This view, however, <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>challenged.</b> The apparent line of attack is applied econometricians frequently assume macroeconomic time series are free of measurement error. This is an assumption that, almost surely, does not hold in practice. ^ In this dissertation, the influence of measurement error upon unit root tests is explored. Then, the behavior of the normalized bias and t-ratio statistics used to test the unit root is examined (1) with asymptotic theory and (2) via computer simulations. I find that the presence of measurement error is highly distorting to the limiting distributions derived in Dickey-Fuller (1979). Specifically, the new limiting distributions of the t-ratio and normalized bias statistics are on the left-hand-side of the original “measurement error-free” Dickey-Fuller distributions. Furthermore, the new limiting distributions are not free of nuisance parameters. Therefore, inferences based on the Dickey-Fuller tests will be highly misleading. ^ Two nuisance parameters enter the new limiting distributions: (1) the variance of measurement error and (2) the variance of the disturbances that drive the underlying stochastic process. Both variances are not directly observable and estimating them is a complicated matter. However, this technical difficulty can be resolved through the method of identification and the estimators of the variances can be constructed. Relying on the proposed variance estimators, modified test statistics, whose limiting distributions are independent of nuisance parameters, are proposed. ^ Using Monte Carlo experiments and response surfaces, sets of accurate critical values of the modified test statistics are estimated. My Monte Carlo experiments show that the modified normalized bias tests have better size properties than the modified t-ratio tests. In addition, the modified normalized bias tests have very good size properties even if the errors follow an MA(1) process with an MA coefficient of moderate size. The modified normalized bias tests are used to test for unit roots in the growth rate of GNP and the CPI. Using the new tests, I find that the growth rate of these macroeconomic time series is nonstationary. ...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{essential}} signaling molecule that plays {{a central role in}} a broad range of physiological functions. Classically, NO is synthesized from L-arginine and molecular oxygen by NO synthases. Once formed, it is rapidly oxidized to nitrite and nitrate. These two inorganic anions were previously considered to be inert end products but this view <b>is</b> now <b>being</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>challenged</b> by research revealing that nitrite can be physiological reduced to again generate NO. The reduction of nitrite in vivo seems particularly enhanced during hypoxia and acidosis; conditions when the oxygendependent NO-synthase pathway is dysfunctional. Besides the endogenous formation of nitrate and nitrite by NO synthase, these anions are also ingested naturally via the diet. The first step in bioactivation of nitrate is formation of the more reactive nitrite anion; a reaction suggested to involve oral nitrate reducing bacteria. It has been generally viewed that mammalian cells cannot metabolize the stable nitrate anion. In the present thesis, we intended to further characterize NO generation from the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. In particular we have studied the importance of commensal bacteria in nitrate metabolism and attempted to explore if mammalian tissues are also capable of nitrate reduction. We also studied possible interactions between the classical NO synthase pathway and the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. We show that bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract play an interesting role in mammalian NO biology. Besides the bioactivation of nitrate in the oral cavity to form nitrite, bacteria in the small and large intestine can catalyze the same reaction and also the subsequent reduction of nitrite to form NO. NO formation in the gut can be stimulated in vivo by supplementation with dietary nitrate and probiotic bacteria. In further studies involving also germ-free mice, we surprisingly find that inorganic nitrate is enzymatically reduced to nitrite in tissues and we identify the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) as the dominant nitrate reductase. Mammalian nitrate reductase activity is enhanced during hypoxic conditions but is also active during normoxia. The functional consequences of this nitrate reductase activity were studied after nitrate administration in vivo. Nitrate attenuated the increased blood pressure caused by an NO synthase inhibitor and prevented the severe decline in blood flow during post-ischemic reperfusion. The expression of XOR is enhanced in tissues of germ free mice, which may reflect a feedback response to the absence of bacterial nitrate reduction in these animals. Such crosstalk is further supported in a study of long-term dietary nitrate supplementation in rats, in which expression of phosphorylated eNOS in aortic tissue and eNOS activity was down-regulated after nitrate supplementation. All together these data suggest a crosstalk between NOS-independent and NOS-dependent pathways in control of NO vascular homeostasis. In summary, the present thesis helps to draw a new picture of mammalian NO generation which occurs by serial reductions of the supposedly inert anions nitrate and nitrite. In this pathway both eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathways contribute to formation of NO and maintenance of homeostasis. Intriguingly, NO formation from nitrate in the gastrointestinal tract, the cardiovascular system and elsewhere, can be controlled by simple dietary interventions with resulting physiological effects...|$|R
