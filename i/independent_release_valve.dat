50|$|It {{released}} the first publicly available dive watch with helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> named the Conquistador. In certain diving situations, helium can penetrate the watch seals and cause a pressure buildup in the watch, eventually blowing the crystal off the watch face. Rolex invented and introduced the first dive watches with a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> in 1969, which prevented this helium buildup. While {{this was a}} major advance at the time, few actual watches with this feature were produced. Doxa introduced the Sub300t Conquistador in 1969 featuring a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> According to the sales brochures and advertisements in Skin diver magazine, DOXA was the first watch company to introduce this device {{to the public for}} general sale. Rolex was manufacturing watches with the Helium <b>Release</b> <b>Valve</b> at the same time, but was only selling them to Commercial Diving Companies such as COMEX. Rolex offered the Sea Dweller with Helium Escape Valve to the public in 1972. Omega also eventually introduced a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> in its Seamaster watch.|$|R

There are however helium <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> {{featuring}} an additional screw-down crown {{at the side}} of the watch. When the diver starts to ascend, the diver simply unscrews the valve's crown to the full open position, allowing any breathing gas that may have been trapped inside the watch to escape during decompression.|$|R
50|$|These {{suits are}} {{typically}} constructed of several layers and, being airtight, include a <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> so the suit does not overinflate from air exhaled by the SCBA.

As noted, such suits are usually limited to just 15-20 minutes of use by their mobile air supply.|$|R

Models that feature a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> include most of the Omega Seamaster series, Rolex Sea Dweller, some dive watches from the Citizen Watch Co., Ltd, Breitling, Girard-Perregaux, Panerai, Mühle Rasmus by Nautische Instrumente Mühle Glashütte, all watches produced by Enzo Mechana, Aegir Watches and selected Doxa, selected Victorinox models, Oris models and TAG Heuer Aquaracer models, {{as well as the}} DEL MAR Professional Dive 1000 watch. Other watch manufacturers such as Seiko still offer high-level dive watches that are guaranteed safe against the effects of helium gas without needing an additional opening in the case in form of a <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> The most extreme mechanical diving watch equipped with a helium relief valve is the 20,000 foot by CX Swiss Military Watch, the current world record holder for mechanical diving watches and featured in the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|R

40|$|Background: Non-surgical {{reduction}} {{remains the}} first line treatment of choice for intussusception. The major complication of air enema reduction is bowel perforation. The authors developed a custom made pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> {{to be added to}} portable insufflation devices, delivering air at pressures accepted as safe for effective reduction of intussusception in children under fluoroscopic guidance. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a custom made pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> that is suitable for the insufflation devices used for air enema reduction of intussusception and to put this valve into regular clinical practice. Materials and Methods: An adjustable, custom made pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> was assembled by the authors using readily available components. The valve was coupled to a simple air enema insufflation device. The device was used for the trial of reduction of intussusception in a prospective study that included 132 patients. Results: The success rate for air enema reduction with the new device was 88. 2 %. The mean pressure required to achieve complete reduction was 100 mmHg. The insufflation pressure never exceeded the preset value (120 mmHg). Of the successful cases, 58. 3 % were reduced from the first attempt while 36. 1 % required a second insufflation. Only 5. 55 % required a third insufflation to complete the reduction. In cases with unsuccessful pneumatic reduction attempt (18. 1 %), surgical treatment was required. Surgery ranged from simple reduction to resection with a primary end to end anastomosis. No complications from air enema were recorded. Conclusions: The authors recommend adding pressure <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> to ensure safety by avoiding pressure overshoot during the procedure...|$|R

40|$|A {{biomimetic}} {{study of}} the bombardier beetle’s explosive discharge apparatus was undertaken using numerical (CFD) modelling, first, of the beetle’s combustion chamber, and then of a scaled-up combustion chamber {{with a view to}} its application to devices such as gas turbine relighters. The new findings about the existence of a pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> at the beetle’s combustion chamber exit yield a clearer understanding of the physics of the beetle’s mass ejection mechanism. The scaled-up chamber (about 1 cm in length) is modelled by considering the chamber to be filled with liquid hexane which then undergoes vapour explosion through a pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> at the exit. The ejection of vaporised fuel at high exit velocities has a number of applications, including gas turbine igniters...|$|R
50|$|Today's largest {{operators}} of trains equipped with vacuum brakes are the Indian Railways and Spoornet (South Africa), however {{there are also}} trains with air brakes and dual brakes in use. South African Railways (Spoornet) operates more than 1 000 electric multiple unit cars, which are fitted with air compressed brakes. The electro-vacuum system uses a 2 in train pipe and basic automatic vacuum brake system, {{with the addition of}} electrically-controlled application and <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> in each vehicle. The application and <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> greatly increase the rate of train pipe vacuum destruction and creation. This, in turn, greatly increases the speed of brake application and release. The performance of electro-vacuum brakes on SAR EMUs is equivalent to electro-pneumatic braked EMUs of a similar age.|$|R
