5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} <b>in</b> <b>art</b> was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light <b>in</b> <b>art</b> as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E
