The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze gaseous organic {{chemicals}} (GOCs) of high traffic (Nishinomiya City: 979, 987 vehicles/day) and low traffic areas (Miki City: 29, 338 ve-hicles/day) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and to evaluate general envi-ronment exposure by PAHs in GOCs. After air sampling using an OMNIPORE membrane filter (< 0. 45 Âµm) and Porapak-QS, sorbents were extracted with solvent (dichloromethane: ace-tone (4 : 1 v/v), and analysis was carried out by GC-MS. Oxidative derivatives of diethylbenzene, such as diacethylbenzene and <b>ethylacetophenone,</b> were detected in GOCs. PAHs and phtha-lates in GOCs were measured. Pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene level were significantly higher in high traffic areas. The geometric mean of pyrene was 0. 76 ng/m 3 for low traff ic areas and 1. 96 ng/m 3 for high traff ic areas; benz[a]anthracene was found at 0. 72 ng/m 3 and 1. 80 ng/m 3 in low and high traffic areas, respectively; benzo[a]pyrene was found at 0. 87 ng/m 3 and 3. 60 ng/m 3 in low and high traffic areas, respectively and benzo[ghi]perylene was found at 0. 57 ng/m 3 and 3. 04 ng/m 3 in low and high traffic areas, respectively. The bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) level was the high-est in the detected GOCs. The geometric mean of the DEHP levels in high traffic and low traffi...|$|E
