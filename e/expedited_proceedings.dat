40|$|The 1987 World Congress on Procedural Law had as {{its main}} theme: ‘Justice and Efficiency’. One {{of the general}} reports was entitled: ‘Use and Abuse of Summary Proceedings’. 2 Today, 10 years later, the {{scholarly}} attention {{to the subject of}} accelerated or <b>expedited</b> <b>proceedings</b> is still as important as at that time. Dutch legal practice shows an increase in the use of this kind of proceedings while the number of ordinary procedures on the merits which last longer and longer, decreases. 3 In Dutch law judicial procedures are characterised by their adversarial nature and written form. If the debtor defends the case a usually time-consuming procedure follows. Accelerated proceedings, if available, offer a well-accepted alternative to the ordinary procedures on the merits. One can even speak of a development in which some procedures for provisional measures, like interim injunction procedures: kort geding at the rechtbank (district court) and voorlopige voorzieningen at the kantongerecht (subdistrict court), are increasingly adopting the characteristics of an accelerated procedure; these provisional proceedings are de facto final since they are no longer followed by a procedure on the merits. These interim procedures are frequently used as a placebo for accelerated proceedings. Accelerated proceedings in the proper sense of this term are hardly known in the Dutch law of civil procedure and are rarely used in practice...|$|E
40|$|Arbitration is {{not just}} another trial procedure. It epitomizes a {{practical}} understanding of the purpose and value of adjudicatory procedures. It poses a substantial challenge to adversarial litigation by exposing its underlying irrationality and its destructive impact upon society. It guarantees {{the rule of law}} domestically and internationally through affordable access, <b>expedited</b> <b>proceedings,</b> expertise, and bridging the gap between national legal systems. It is a valuable institution that should not become a pawn in the tired and unimaginative political discourse that substitutes 2 ̆ 7 talking points 2 ̆ 7 for genuine reflection and debate. The gravamen of the current attack on arbitration is not the preservation of American constitutional culture, but the advancement of an ideological agenda and the economic self-interest of a special interest group favored by those in power. The high-minded rhetoric simply creates a respectable camouflage for engaging in collusion, greed,and self-serving partisanship. Arbitration embodies a trial process grounded in common sense, flexibility, and an ethic of problem-solving. Arbitral proceedings allow disputing parties and their representatives to assemble the facts, present witnesses, assert and contest positions, and argue about governing predicates. They culminate in a final ruling by the adjudicator on the matters under consideration. Only a true failure in procedural fairness may lead to a viable appeal. In other words, arbitration personifies due process and justice. It enables society to resolve disputes and to prosper by dedicating its resources to other activities. Arbitration withstood the prejudicial assessments of old. It outlasted judicial animosity. It has discredited the religion of process. It traverses the formidable cultural divides between varying national concepts of justice. It undergirds global economic transactions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{and discuss the}} Finnish Arbitration Act and its current suitability {{to the needs of}} the international commercial arbitration and accordingly provides de lege ferenda interpretation and proposal for legislative revision with respect to the current Finnish Arbitration Act. According to the analysis provided in this thesis, the current Arbitration Act from 1992 is lacking the relevant and internationally demanded provisions concerning arbitrator-ordered interim measures of protection, multiparty and multicontract arbitrations and <b>expedited</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Furthermore, it seems that the current provisions on the written form requirement of the arbitration agreement and scope of arbitrabilty are too limited and hence should be amended. The improvements suggested by this thesis are intended to modernise the current law, by making it more efficient, and to establish improved, efficient and internationally approved legislative framework for arbitration, with modern arbitral instruments in it. The five main improvements are the following: 1) In order to be consistent with the needs of contemporary international business, this thesis recommends Finnish legislators to take more flexible approach to the form requirement of the arbitration agreement and to follow the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law when drafting the provision for the new Arbitration Act. 2) The current indefined status of tribunal-ordered interim measures in Finland is lacking in terms of actual legislation and thus causes unnecessary ambiguousness. To avoid the existing uncertainty, the new Arbitration Act should confirm the arbitral tribunal's powers to grant enforceable interim measures. 3) This thesis recommends that the new Arbitration Act should provide a wider scope for arbitrability. It would be instructive for the legislators to examine if the concept of arbitrability would be defined in terms of monetary nature of the dispute. 4) Since a significant and increasing number of contemporary international arbitrations involve multi-party or multi-contract disputes the new Arbitration Act should confess their existence to improve the efficiency of arbitration process. Furthermore, the legislators should build functioning framework for multiparty and multi-contract arbitrations to avoid conflicting awards, which may arise out of separate arbitration proceedings. 5) The Finnish legislators should consider setting a time limit for rendering an award and include a ‘summary procedure’ provision to the new Arbitration Act. It would be recommended to use a sole arbitrator and limit the time for rendering the award, for instance as the FAI Rules imposes, to three months...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{suggests}} {{the creation of}} specialty health courts to oversee medical malpractice cases, {{as an alternative to}} traditional tort reform. Tort reform has primarily focused on reducing litigation by creating impediments for plaintiffs to pursue medical malpractice cases. This has lessened the amount of litigation and reduced the likelihood of medical liability for defendants, but leaves uncompensated plaintiffs and has not served as a deterrence to future injuries. In this respect, specialized health courts, like other specialty courts in the United States, would be established to handle this aspect of litigation, by restoring the connection between medical liability and patient safety. The health courts would have lawyers and health-care practitioners, <b>expedited</b> evidentiary-based <b>proceedings,</b> and fully-compensated economic damages and “scheduled” non-economic damages. Additionally, neutral health experts, established precedent through opinions rendered by these health courts, and a compensation standard of avoidable medical injuries—instead of a negligence standard—would further assist physicians by creating a body of law to help them better assess risks of liability in their provision of medical care, and ultimately foment safer medical practices.

40|$|Viewed from a {{distance}} the outward appearances of the English Legal System might look reassuringly stable. In fact, {{nothing could be further}} from the case. During the last ten years almost every facet of the system, even the constitutional order, has been radically overhauled, or at least significantly modified. The whole system of civil procedure has been recast, after over a hundred years of relatively little major modification, in an attempt to simplify and <b>expedite</b> <b>proceedings</b> with a new emphasis on judicial case management. Perhaps most important of all, the Human Rights Act 1998, which has been effective from October 2, 2000, requires courts to take account of the European Convention on Human Rights in reaching their decisions. Most recently, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 extends the draconian confiscation provisions, which were already in place for drug related offences to offences generally. The climate is therefore one of pervasive change in many areas of law, and this includes criminal procedure to a very significant degree. Against this background of change, it is striking that the movement towards codification of the criminal law, substantive and procedural, has made no ground at all, and shows no sign of doing so. Such reform as has been carried out has been entirely piecemeal and there is nothing to compare with the Uniform or Federal Rules of Evidence. It will come as no surprise that there does not appear to be any interest, outside academic circles, for a codification of criminal procedure. As one commentator has observed, not only would there be significant advantages to codification, it would also be eminently feasible. That something better could be achieved might be indicated by the way criminal procedure was rationalised in Scotland over twenty-five years ago by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. In 1995, a further Act consolidated subsequent legislation and still managed to be shorter than its predecessor. If codification has proved to be so uncontroversially feasible in Scotland, is there any compelling reason why England could not achieve as much? Against this general background, issues of incompetent representation and miscarriage of justice have posed a number of different problems recently and elicited at least one major reform of the procedural structure, the institution of a Criminal Cases Review Commission...|$|R

While commentators got a resolution to the split, they received {{a great deal more}} than they had been promised. Stylistic opacity made the opinion in Hall Street somewhat inaccessible. In fact, as rendered, the opinion may be more significant for what it omits than for what it actually says. The justices envisage arbitration as an instrument of practical policy, and they alter, repair, and modify the doctrine to maintain the efficacy of its application. Arbitration is not a basis upon which to conduct lofty juridical debates. Hall Street Associates reintroduces balance and stability to the U. S. law of arbitration. By emphasizing the importance of <b>expedited</b> enforcement <b>proceedings,</b> the Hall Street Court solidifies judicial support for the operation of the arbitration process and its outcomes.

This report describes the utilization of 'bait vehicles' and associated technologies in the context of motor vehicle theft along the southwest border of the U. S. More than 100 bait vehicles are estimated to be in use by individual agencies and auto theft task forces in the southwestern border states.

500|$|In 1538, {{the king}} and Cromwell {{arranged}} with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance. Henry had been seeking a new embassy from the Schmalkaldic League since summer 1537. The Lutherans were delighted by this and they sent a joint delegation from various German cities, including a colleague of Martin Luther, Friedrich Myconius. The delegates arrived in England on 27 May 1538. After initial meetings with the king, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to Lambeth Palace under Cranmer's chairmanship. Progress on an agreement was slow partly due to Cromwell being too busy to help <b>expedite</b> the <b>proceedings</b> and {{partly due to the}} negotiating team on the English side, which was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers. The talks dragged on through the summer with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop's strenuous efforts. The negotiations, however, were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the king. Cranmer's colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry's Privy Council, had died earlier in the year. The king chose as his replacement Cranmer's conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice. On 5 August, when the German delegates {{sent a letter to the}} king regarding three items that particularly worried them (compulsory clerical celibacy, the withholding of the chalice from the laity, and the maintenance of private masses for the dead), Tunstall was able to intervene for {{the king and}} to influence the decision.

40|$|Seeking asylum {{is a human}} right, {{enshrined}} in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (“Refugee Convention”) and its 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (“ 1967 Protocol”) prohibit the United States from returning refugees to persecution, and the 1980 Refugee Act set up a formal process for applying for asylum in the United States. However, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) created a barrage of new barriers to asylum. These impediments have blocked many refugees from accessing asylum in the United States and inserted additional layers of technicalities, screening, and processing, undermining {{the effectiveness of the}} US asylum system. The barriers imposed by IIRIRA are significant. They include a filing deadline on asylum applications, which prevents genuine refugees from receiving asylum if they cannot prove they have filed the application within one year of arriving in the United States. IIRIRA also established summary deportation procedures, including “expedited removal” and “reinstatement of removal,” which block asylum seekers from even applying for asylum or accessing an immigration court removal hearing, unless they first pass through a screening process. Finally, IIRIRA imposed “mandatory detention” on certain immigrants, including asylum seekers who are placed in <b>expedited</b> removal <b>proceedings</b> upon their arrival at a US port of entry. Each of these provisions imposed new processes and procedures that have contributed to an increasingly ineffective immigration system. The current backlog in the immigration courts has reached a record high, surpassing half a million cases, while the backlog of affirmative asylum cases before the Asylum Division of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has increased by a factor of six [check] in just three years. Backlogs, which lead to long delays in adjudication, undermine system integrity as bona fide asylum seekers wait for years in legal limbo — some with families waiting abroad in dangerous and life-threatening situations — and individuals without meritorious claims may be encouraged to file applications to receive a work permit during the lengthy waiting period. Twenty years later, as the world faces the largest global refugee crisis since World War II, the asylum barriers injected into the US system under IIRIRA have proven harmful to refugees, and detrimental to the US asylum system. This paper highlights recent research, litigation, and advocacy efforts that have further brought to light the rights violations and systemic inefficiencies generated by IIRIRA. It concludes with a series of recommendations, calling on the US government to eliminate these counterproductive barriers and to take steps to assure access to asylum...|$|R
