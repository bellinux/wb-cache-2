It was registered at the Court of the Lord Lyon in 1956, making it the first provincial tartan in Canada, and officially adopted by the province in the Nova Scotia Tartan Act of 1963.

2500|$|The {{idea of an}} {{official}} tartan for Northwest Territories was proposed by Janet Anderson-Thomson after she attended an RCMP ball in 1966 and noticed that the piper was, as she later described it, [...] "terribly drab". She and her husband John, a land surveyor, both discussed the idea with Stuart Hodgson, then Commissioner of Northwest Territories, who supported it. The design was then created by Hugh MacPherson (Scotland) Limited of Edinburgh, a tartan designer and manufacturer, with Anderson-Thomson's colour suggestions: green for the forests, white for the Arctic Ocean, blue for the Northwest Passage, gold for the territories' mineral wealth, red-orange for autumn foliage, and a thin black line to represent the tree line.

50|$|In economics, <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> {{generally}} are time series summarising movements {{in a group}} of related variables.

40|$|This paper defines and {{discusses}} {{the choices that}} are implicit in alternative approaches to constructing <b>index</b> <b>numbers.</b> The central theoretical result is the exogeneity theorem, which states that an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system possesses certain generally desirable properties, associated with meaningfulness, relevance and consistency {{if and only if}} it admits of a welfare interpretation that is invariant to the data to which it is applied. An <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system that does not permit a fixed welfare interpretation of this kind will fail to possess these properties. Moreover, it will not be possible to undertake meaningful multilateral comparisons between all possible units of comparison to which the <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system may be applied without adopting a metaevaluative criterion that expresses welfare judgments concerning the relation between distinct evaluative standards. Therefore, explicit or implicit normative judgments are inescapable in the construction and use of <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> intended to permit meaningful comparisons over an unrestricted domain. We identify a set of bounds on the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> that an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system produces (the "generalized within bounds" requirement) which define necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be rationalizable (i. e. to possess a welfare interpretation). However, multilateral <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems that are widely in use violate this and other requirements of the exogeneity theorem. As a result, the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> they produce do not admit of a welfare interpretation which is invariant to the data to which they are applied, and indeed may not admit of any welfare interpretation at all. The exogeneity theorem establishes that the rationale for "exact" <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems is much less compelling than widely believed. A fixed welfare interpretation is also a necessary and sufficient condition for the path independence of the Divisia index. The theorem therefore establishes a three-way equivalence between desirable properties of continuous <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems, desirable properties of discrete <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems and the existence of a fixed welfare interpretation...|$|R
