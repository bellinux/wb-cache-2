5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the users, but their <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that land titling programs have positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> housing investments, negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> household size, and positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> child education. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> the labor market are not conclusive. There is weak support for the hypothesis that land titling can have positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> capital investment because the dwelling can be used as collateral. The reason could be due to the very limited access of slum dwellers to the credit market. Another reason could be that the high legal costs of eviction and executing a mortgage might preclude mortgaged credit (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011).|$|R
40|$|Objective: Testosterone has a {{spectrum}} of <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the male organism. This review attempts to determine, from published studies, the time-course of the effects induced by testosterone replacement therapy from their first manifestation until maximum effects are attained. Design: Literature data on testosterone replacement. Results: <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> sexual interest appear after 3 weeks plateauing at 6 weeks, with no further increments expected beyond. Changes in erections/ejaculations may require up to 6 months. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> quality of life manifest within 3 – 4 weeks, but maximum benefits take longer. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> depressive mood become detectable after 3 – 6 weeks with a maximum after 18 – 30 weeks. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> erythropoiesis are evident at 3 months, peaking at 9 – 12 months. Prostate-specific antigen and volume rise, marginally, plateauing at 12 months; further increase should be related to aging rather than therapy. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> lipids appear after 4 weeks, maximal after 6 – 12 months.

40|$|This {{research}} is conducted {{to find out}} the effect of investment opportunity set and free cash flow towards dividend policy and its impacts on firm value of manufacturing companies registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange during the period of 2011 - 2013. The samples of this study are 25 manufacturing companies and they were selected by using purposive sampling method. The data is collected through non participants’ observation. Path analysis which is an extension of the multiple linear regression technique is used to analyze data. Based on the data analysis, it was found that, investment opportunity set has positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> dividend policy. It refuses the negative hypothesis, free cash flow has positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> dividend policy, investment opportunity set has positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value, free cash flow has positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value, dividend policy has positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value, investment opportunity set has <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value  through dividend  policy  and free  cash flow has no  <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value  through  dividend   policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} several reviews have been {{presented}} and the aspects of road safety associated with intelligent transport systems (ITS) applications have been addressed. The attempt {{is to make a}} state-of-the-art regarding <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> accidents by categorising systems according to levels of evaluations methods that have been applied. These categories are <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> behaviour, <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> accidents by proxy/surrogate methods, accident studies from real traffic, <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> accident types and finally by meta-analysis where weighted estimates of <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> accidents can be calculated. Thirty-three IT systems including driver assistance systems/advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle information systems, in-vehicle data-collection systems and road telematics have been listed. <b>Effects</b> based <b>on</b> meta-analysis are estimated for 11 systems, and single accident studies are found for an additional 2 systems. For the remaining 20 systems, no studies from real road traffic have been identified. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> accidents of antilocking brake systems and electronic stability control (ESC) are presented in more detail according to their <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> certain accident types. ESC appears to be very efficient in reducing the number of accidents. Behavioural adaptations to ITS are considered and discussed, especially in terms of compensation mechanisms. Four hypotheses regarding prediction of <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> accidents are stated according to whether systems increase or decrease 'windows of opportunities' by calling upon a driver behaviour model where emotions play a central role. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007...|$|R
