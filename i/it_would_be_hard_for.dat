25|$|Because of {{his support}} among {{elements}} of the party, Zuma remained a powerful political figure, retaining a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal as the country's deputy president. A panel of political analysts convened in November 2005 agreed {{that if he was}} to be found innocent of the corruption charges brought against him, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> any other potential ANC candidate to beat Zuma {{in the race for the}} country's presidency in 2009. However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a left-wing candidate of the sort that many of his supporters seem to seek, and noted that the global and national economic constraints that have shaped Mbeki's presidency would be no different in the next presidential term.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E

25|$|After {{close to}} a month without {{international}} cricket, Australia toured India for two Tests and three one-day games in October, in {{what would be the}} team's last Test series ahead of the summer's Ashes in Australia. Haddin again failed to recover sufficiently for the series and Paine was named wicket-keeper. In a drawn three-day first-class match before the Test series, Paine scored a slow 45 and zero; failing to capitalise on his promotion to four in the batting order for the second innings. Returning to the traditional wicket-keepers spot of seven for the Test series, Paine battled to his highest Test score, 92 from 196 balls, in the first innings of the First Test in Mohali. In hot conditions, he displayed good shot selection and concentration, despite suffering from cramp in the latter stages of his innings. Still, when Australia was bowled out soon after his dismissal, Paine assumed wicket-keeper duties for India’s innings, where he took two catches. In his team's second innings, however, Paine scored only nine, as Australia collapsed to set India a target of 216 runs. They achieved the score with just one wicket remaining; Paine taking one catch. After the Test, Melbourne newspaper The Herald Sun, wrote an article saying that Paine could become Australia's future Test captain. The Second Test saw him continue his good form with the bat, scoring 59 and 9, but Australia lost the match and the series 2–0. Afterwards, former Australian wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh suggested <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Haddin to regain his spot in the Australian team for the Ashes. India won the opening one-dayer and therefore took the series 1–0 when rain washed out the remaining two matches. Paine struggled in the match, compiling 9 from 24 balls.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, Thompson sent out an e-mail {{alerting}} {{the press about}} a conference call where he would make major announcement about the campaign. [...] Though some speculated that Thompson would {{drop out of the}} race during the call, he instead announced his intentions to participate in the Ames Straw Poll. [...] The move reaffirmed his strategy of relying on the straw poll to propel him from the lower tier, despite moves by the campaigns of Rudy Giuliani and John McCain to withdraw from the event. Drake University political science professor Dennis Goldford analyzed the straw poll strategy and commented that if Thompson [...] "didn't make some sort of substantive showing" [...] <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> his money flow to continue.|$|E
500|$|From 2003 to 2010, Dale {{appeared}} in his longest running American roles. He starred in the Fox TV series, The O.C. playing Caleb Nichol, a wealthy tycoon. The producers saw that the character had further potential, and made his initially recurring role a regular character in the series. After 35 appearances, Caleb was killed off in the second-season episode [...] "The O.Sea" [...] in 2005. Dale was disappointed that Caleb was written out and {{described it as a}} mistake by the production staff. In 2006, Dale was cast in the starring role of Bradford Meade, the owner of Meade Publications in the ABC show Ugly Betty. Although he impressed the producers in his audition, he initially lost the role to a [...] "bigger star". After said star began [...] "causing trouble" [...] and was fired, Dale was given the part. Bradford was killed off during the show's second season. Dale {{appeared in}} the second-season finale of Lost, [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", as Charles Widmore, a businessman and leader of the Others. Dale's publicist was initially worried that Widmore (who {{was an integral part of}} the show's mystery) would become a starring role, meaning <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Dale to appear in both Lost and Ugly Betty at the same time. The part became a recurring role, with Dale appearing numerous times between seasons two (2006) and six (2010). He enjoyed the role but often found it difficult due to his character's unclear motivation.|$|E

2500|$|After {{not being}} given a {{contract}} with the Queensland Bulls for the 2007–08 season, Nash decided to try to restart his career by moving to the West Indies. Speaking of his decision, he said [...] "I was obviously very disappointed to miss out on a contract, but I pretty much got told <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me to work my way back in again and I felt I still have something to offer". In October 2007, Nash was named in the Jamaican squad. Nash {{played a key role in}} Jamaica winning the KFC Cup. In the final, he scored 117 as his team beat Trinidad and Tobago by nine wickets. Nash finished the season with 422 first-class runs at 46.88 to his name from the domestic competition and was third in the batting averages. There was surprise in some quarters when Nash was not selected for the Test series against Australia in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{media can}} be used not only as public {{relations}} and direct marketing tools but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities and as effective customer engagement tools. [...] Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper {{is likely to be}} read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target niche markets even more precisely. Using digital tools such as Google Adsense, advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming. Google Adsense does this by looking for keywords in social media user's online posts and comments. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with [...] "special issue" [...] sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{was found}} dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. After a local paper {{reported}} that he had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner's office received so many calls asking about Webb's death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had committed suicide. When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: [...] "It's unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility." [...] News coverage noted that there were widespread rumors on the Internet at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his 'Dark Alliance' series, published eight years before, but Webb's ex-wife Susan Bell told reporters that she believed Webb had committed suicide. [...] "The way he was acting <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me to believe it was anything but suicide," [...] she said. According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.|$|E
