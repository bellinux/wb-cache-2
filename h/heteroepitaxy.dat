50|$|<b>Heteroepitaxy</b> {{is a kind}} of epitaxy {{performed}} with materials that are different from each other. In <b>heteroepitaxy,</b> a crystalline film grows on a crystalline substrate or film of a different material.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example of}} <b>heteroepitaxy</b> is gallium nitride (GaN) on {{sapphire}} ...|$|E
50|$|AlGaInP {{layer is}} often grown by <b>heteroepitaxy</b> on gallium {{arsenide}} or gallium phosphide {{in order to}} form a quantum well structure.|$|E
50|$|This {{structure}} can {{be grown}} by molecular beam <b>heteroepitaxy.</b> GaAs and AlAs in particular are used to form this structure. AlAs/InGaAs or InAlAs/InGaAs can be used.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heteroepitaxy</b> {{is a kind}} of epitaxy {{performed}} with materials that are different from each other. In <b>heteroepitaxy,</b> a crystalline film grows on a crystalline substrate or film of a different material. This technology is often used to grow crystalline films of materials for which crystals cannot otherwise be obtained and to fabricate integrated crystalline layers of different materials. Examples include silicon on sapphire, gallium nitride (...) on sapphire, aluminium gallium indium phosphide (...) on gallium arsenide (...) or diamond or iridium., and graphene on hexagonal boron nitride.|$|E
50|$|InAsSbP layers can {{be grown}} by <b>heteroepitaxy</b> on indium arsenide, gallium {{antimonide}} and other materials. The vibrational properties of the alloy have been investigated by Raman spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|Heterotopotaxy is {{a process}} similar to <b>heteroepitaxy</b> except that thin film growth {{is not limited to}} {{two-dimensional}} growth; the substrate is similar only in structure to the thin-film material.|$|E
50|$|GaInAsSbP layers can {{be grown}} by <b>heteroepitaxy</b> on indium arsenide, gallium {{antimonide}} and other materials. The exact composition can be tuned {{in order to make}} it lattice matched. The presence of five elements in the alloy allows extra degrees of freedom, making it possible to fix the lattice constant while varying the bandgap. Eg Ga0.92In0.08P0.05As0.08Sb0.87 is lattice matched to InAs.|$|E
50|$|The term {{homoepitaxy}} {{refers to}} the specific {{case in which a}} film of the same material is grown on a crystallinesubstrate. This technology is used, for instance, to grow a film which is more pure than the substrate, has a lower densityof defects, and to fabricate layers having different doping levels. <b>Heteroepitaxy</b> {{refers to the}} case in which the film being deposited is different than the substrate.|$|E
50|$|Epitaxial films may {{be grown}} from gaseous or liquid precursors. Because the {{substrate}} {{acts as a}} seed crystal, the deposited film may lock into one or more crystallographic orientations {{with respect to the}} substrate crystal. If the overlayer either forms a random orientation with respect to the substrate or does not form an ordered overlayer, it is termed non-epitaxial growth. If an epitaxial film is deposited on a substrate of the same composition, the process is called homoepitaxy; otherwise it is called <b>heteroepitaxy.</b>|$|E
50|$|II-VI {{semiconductor}} compound {{are produced}} with epitaxy methods, like most semiconductor compounds. The substrate {{plays an important}} role for all fabrication methods. Best growth results are obtained by substrates made from the same compound (homoepitaxy), but substrates of other semiconductors are often used to reduce the fabrication cost (a method called <b>heteroepitaxy).</b> In particular, III-V semiconductor compounds like gallium arsenide are frequently used as cheap substrates, resulting in stronger tensions between substrate and growth layer and (generally) lower optoelectronic properties.|$|E
50|$|Grandjean {{was born}} in Dijon, France, and is a citizen of that country. He studied at the University of Clermont-Ferrand and Nice-Sophia Antipolis. In 1991, he joined the Solid-State Physics and Solar Energy Laboratory, a {{division}} of the French National Center for Scientific Research where he studied physical properties of nanostructures. By 1994 he obtained his Ph.D. and became a CNRS winner. Later on, as a senior research fellow, he worked at the Research Center for <b>Heteroepitaxy</b> and its Applications, a division of Sophia Antipolis. In 2004 he became a tenure professor at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and in June 2009 assisted {{in the creation of the}} Novagan startup, following by becoming a director of the Laboratory of Advanced Semiconductors for Photonics and Electronics where he still serves.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heteroepitaxy</b> {{has evolved}} rapidly in recent years. With each {{new wave of}} material/substrate combinations, our {{understanding}} of how to control crystal growth becomes more refined. Most books on the subject focus on a specific material or material family, narrowly explaining the processes and techniques appropriate for each. Surveying the principles common to all types of semiconductor materials, <b>Heteroepitaxy</b> of Semiconductors: Theory, Growth, and Characterization is the first comprehensive, fundamental introduction to the field. This book reflects our current understanding of nucleation, growth modes, relaxation of strained layers, and dislocation dynamics without emphasizing any particular material. Following an overview of the properties of semiconductors, the author introduces the important heteroepitaxial growth methods and provides a survey of semiconductor crystal surfaces, their structures, and nucleation. With this foundation, the book provides in-depth descriptions of mismatched <b>heteroepitaxy</b> and lattice strain relaxation, various characterization tools used to monitor and evaluate the growth process, and finally, defect engineering approaches. Numerous examples highlight the concepts while extensive micrographs, schematics of experimental setups, and graphs illustrate the discussion. Serving as a solid starting point for this rapidly evolving area, <b>Heteroepitaxy</b> of Semiconductors: Theory, Growth, and Characterization makes the principles of <b>heteroepitaxy</b> easily accessible to anyone preparing to enter the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} and experimental status of surfactant mediated semiconductor epitaxial growth is reviewed. We discuss homoepitaxy {{as well as}} <b>heteroepitaxy,</b> and emphasize in particular {{issues related to the}} mechanism by which surfactants suppress growth of three dimensional islands in <b>heteroepitaxy.</b> We argue that the dominant mechanism is passivation of island edges, which leads to suppression of attachment and detachment of atoms to and from island edges.

30|$|III–V {{nanowires}} (NWs) {{have attracted}} considerable interest as building blocks {{in almost all}} fields of semiconductor technology [1 – 4]. In particular, their small footprint allows for efficient elastic strain relaxation [5] and hence for high crystallinity during <b>heteroepitaxy</b> even if the lattice mismatch is tremendous [6]. This opens a very wide field of material combinations, which are hard to realize with high crystallinity in planar <b>heteroepitaxy.</b> Accordingly, restrictions ruled by the requirement of lattice-matching are reduced, and emphasis can {{be focused on the}} engineering of optoelectronical, chemical, and structural properties of the NWs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{detailed}} structural {{characterization of}} 3 C-SiC heteroepitaxial films grown on 4 H- and 6 H-SiC mesa surfaces. 3 C-SiC heterofilms grown by the “step-free surface <b>heteroepitaxy</b> ” process, free of double-positioning boundary (DPB) and stacking-fault (SF) defects, {{were compared to}} less-optimized 3 C-SiC heterofilms using High Resolution X-ray Diffraction (HRXRD), High Resolution Cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRXTEM), molten potassium hydroxide (KOH) etching, and dry thermal oxidation.

40|$|The {{nucleation}} {{and growth}} of 2 D layers of tetraphenyl porphyrin molecules on Ag(111) are studied with variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. The organic/metal <b>heteroepitaxy</b> occurs by strict analogy to established principles for metal <b>heteroepitaxy.</b> A hierarchy of energy barriers for diffusion on terraces and along edges and around corners of adislands is established. The temperature is key to activating these barriers selectively, thus determining {{the shape of the}} organic aggregates, from a fractal shape at lower temperatures to a compact shape at higher temperatures. The energy barriers for the terrace diffusion of porpyrins and the molecule-molecule binding energy were determined to be 30 meV 3 ̆c Eterrace 3 ̆c 60 and 130 meV 3 ̆c Ediss 3 ̆c 160 meV, respectively, from measurements of island sizes as a function of temperature. This study provides an experimental verification of the validity of current models of epitaxy for the <b>heteroepitaxy</b> of organics and is thus expected to help establish design principles for complex metal-organic hybrid structures...|$|E

40|$|Advances in Electronics and Optics {{are often}} preceded by discoveries in Crystal Growth theory and practice. This article {{represents}} in retrospect {{some of the}} most significant contributions of <b>heteroepitaxy</b> in these and some other areas—the strong impact of the three modes of <b>heteroepitaxy</b> on microelectronics and quantum optics, the big “push” of PENDEO epitaxy in development of Light Emitting Diodes, etc. A large part of the text is dedicated to <b>heteroepitaxy</b> of nonlinear optical materials grown on orientation-patterned templates and used in the development of new quasi-phase-matching frequency conversion laser sources. By achieving new frequency ranges such sources will result {{in a wide variety of}} applications in areas such as defense, security, industry, medicine, and science. Interesting facts from the scientific life of major contributors in the field are mixed in the text with fine details from growth experiments, chemical equations, results from material characterizations and some optical and crystallographic considerations—all these presented in a popular way but without neglecting their scientific importance and depth. The truth is that often <b>heteroepitaxy</b> is not just the better but the only available option. The truth is that delays in device development are usually due to gaps in materials research. In all this, miscommunication between different scientific communities always costs vain efforts, uncertainty, and years of going in a wrong scientific direction. With this article we aim to stimulate a constructive dialog that could lead to solutions of important interdisciplinary scientific and technical issues...|$|E

40|$|Two {{approaches}} to achieving reduced-defect active regions in III-N devices are discussed – confined epitaxy and <b>heteroepitaxy</b> on step-free SiC surfaces. In confined epitaxy, sapphire substrates (either GaN coated or not) are patterned with a dielectric mask and then III-N device structures are selectively and vertically {{grown in the}} openings using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
