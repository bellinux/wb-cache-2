40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to explore the}} representation of gender in an international ELT series, i. e., American Headway Student Textbooks. Fairclough’s (2001) three-dimensional model was selected and adopted as the model of study. Effectively, different parts of American Headway Student Textbooks were investigated systematically vis-à-vis eight factors, i. e. <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male's</b> characters, <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> social roles, <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> domestic roles, <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> semantic roles, <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male’s</b> titles, order of appearance, masculine generic construction, activities <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males</b> engaged in, <b>and</b> finally the pictorial representation of both genders. The findings of the study revealed that the series are suffering from two types of sexism—overt and covert ones—the overt one discriminates against females in a vivid way and the covert one exploits the women as an instrument for advertising {{in order to promote}} selling. This study suggests that the series are instilling capitalism economy as ideology...|$|R

5|$|The {{embryonic}} heart begins beating {{at around}} 22 days after conception (5 {{weeks after the}} last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother's which is about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to decelerate, slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth.

5|$|The {{reproductive}} caste of {{a mature}} colony includes a fertile <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male,</b> {{known as the}} queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king mates with her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates {{at a certain time}} of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators.|$|E

These groups are {{typically}} led by a dominant <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male,</b> who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. This group was chosen because of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years.

5|$|<b>Female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male</b> {{flowers in}} each syconium mature at {{different}} times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay {{eggs in the}} female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in Brisbane found that F. obliqua trees often bore {{both male and female}} syconia at the same time—this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands. The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter, thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the clinical assessment of the pelvic-hip complex muscle and trunk flexibility is sufficient for diagnosing generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). A cross-sectional study. Center of Body Posture in Olsztyn, North East Poland. The study included 136 <b>females</b> <b>and</b> 113 <b>males</b> aged 10 - 13 years. In order to assess muscle flexibility, the straight leg raise (SLR) test (for hamstring) and modified Thomas test for one- (O-JHF) and two-joint (T-JHF) hip flexors were performed. To evaluate trunk flexibility the fingertip-to-floor (FTF) and lateral trunk flexion (LTF) tests were used. The GJH occurrence was assessed with the use of nine-point Beighton scale (threshold value ≥ 5 points for females, ≥ 4 for males). The analysis was carried out separately for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males.</b> There were no significant differences between females with versus without GJH, <b>and</b> <b>males</b> with versus without GJH regarding SLR (p = 0. 86, p = 0. 19 for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively), O-JHF (p = 0. 89, p = 0. 35 for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively), T-JHF (p = 0. 77, p = 0. 4 for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively), FTF (p = 0. 19, p = 0. 84 for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively) <b>and</b> LTF (p = 0. 58, p = 0. 35 for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> <b>males,</b> respectively) tests results. Clinical examination of the pelvic-hip complex muscles and trunk flexibility by use of SLR, O-JHF, T-JHF, FTF and LTF revealed to be insufficient in diagnosing GJH in children aged 10 - 13 years. Thus, the Beighton scale should be considered a standard element of physiotherapeutic examination of the musculoskeletal system in children and youth...|$|R
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male</b> characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male</b> prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in <b>female</b> <b>and</b> <b>male</b> coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E
