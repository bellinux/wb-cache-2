5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} <b>important</b> <b>one</b> for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and {{at a much lower}} altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar jet stream.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 Tour de France was {{the third}} edition of the Tour de France, held from 9 to 30 July, {{organized}} by the newspaper L'Auto. Following the disqualifications after the 1904 Tour de France, there were changes in the rules, the most <b>important</b> <b>one</b> being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the Tour de France, and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm {{was the son}} of John Chisholm, master house painter, and his wife, Elizabeth McGeachy Macleod. He left Queen's Park School, Glasgow, at {{the early}} age of 13 due to ill-health but showed a talent for music {{composition}} and some of his pieces were published during his childhood. He had piano lessons with Philip Halstead at Glasgow's Athenaeum School of Music, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and later studied the organ under Herbert Walton, the organist at Glasgow Cathedral. By the time he was 12 he was giving organ recitals including an <b>important</b> <b>one</b> in Kingston upon Hull. The pianist Leff Pouishnoff then became his principal teacher and mentor. In 1927 he travelled to Nova Scotia, Canada, where he was appointed the organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, New Glasgow, and director of music at Pictou Academy.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only <b>important</b> <b>one</b> was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making {{millions of acres of}} government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The most <b>important</b> <b>one</b> {{is how the}} material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|Wind is {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an <b>important</b> <b>one</b> being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.|$|E

5|$|The most <b>important</b> <b>one</b> {{is known}} as Maha Devale or Maha Kovil and is {{dedicated}} to Skanda-Murugan known amongst the Sinhalese as Kataragama deviyo. It {{does not have a}} statute of the deity; instead it holds a Yantra, a spiritual drawing of the deity's power. Of all the shrines in the complex, it is the largest and the first that all pilgrims come to visit. Although it does not have a representation of the deity, kept in an adjoining room is a statue of Shiva also known amongst Sinhalese as Karanduva. Within it there is a clay arm chair known as Kalana Mandima that supposedly belonged to Kalyanagiri Swamy. It is covered by a leopard’s skin and on it has all the ceremonial instruments. To the left of the main shrine lies a smaller shrine dedicated to Hindu god Ganesha who {{is known as}} Ganapatidevio amongst Sinhalese. Tamils refer to him as the Manica Pillaiyar as well. It too is a small rectangular building without any decoration. To the left of Ganesha shrine stands the Vishnu Devale the shrine dedicated to Vishnu within which there is also a Buddha image. Behind this is a large Bo tree that tradition holds as sprung from the sapling of the original Bo tree in Anuradhapura, hence is very much held in high esteem by the visiting Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is an <b>important</b> <b>one</b> {{for plant}} and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E
