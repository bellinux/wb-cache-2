Therefore, C++ supports not just OO programming, but other decomposition paradigms, like modular programming.|$|E

If the Telford Steam Railway were to expand and cross the river Severn via the Albert Edward Bridge and operate to the original site of Buildwas Junction station, it would operate over a very short part of the former Severn Valley Line. The planned closure of Ironbridge Power Station In 2015 further adds to the debate because this covers the site of Buildwas Junction station. However, there are several obstacles to overcome, not least of which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the land north of Bridgnorth tunnel is in private ownership. The Holybush Road was widened and raised after closure, impeding access to the southern portal of Bridgnorth tunnel. The group currently promoting such an extension has identified a viable technical solution to this and other difficulties.|$|E

500|$|Poe imitates many {{traditional}} [...] "Germanic" [...] elements in this tale. The most obvious {{example is the}} gloomy old castle, typical of Gothic fiction. The story also includes typical Gothic themes, which scholar Dawn Sova refers to as [...] "hints at secret obsessions and sins, foreboding prophecies, family rivalry". These Gothic conventions had been a staple of popular fiction in Europe and the United States for several decades by the time Poe utilized them. Considering the subtitle, [...] "A Tale in Imitation of the German", critics and scholars disagree if Poe may have, in fact, intended the story as a satire or burlesque of the genre, purposely exaggerating {{the elements of the}} Gothic to be humorous. Other evidence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the other three stories Poe published in 1832 ("The Duc de l'Omelette", [...] "A Tale of Jerusalem", and [...] "Bon-Bon") are comic tales written, as Poe said, [...] "intended for half banter, half satire". The story also uses irony as a form of humor: Despite the family's prophecy that [...] "the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing", the opposite occurs. The suggestion that [...] "Metzengerstein" [...] is purposefully written as a satire has been disputed, especially because of Poe's revisions throughout its many republications where he removed some of the more exaggerated material.|$|E

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the delay between the {{gathering}} of and transmission of data <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the New Horizons instrumentation is body-mounted. In order for the cameras to record data, the entire probe must turn, and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward Earth. [...] Previous spacecraft, such as the Voyager program probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a [...] "scan platform") that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth. New Horizons elimination of excess mechanisms was implemented to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year lifetime.|$|E

[...] These have been listed in the chart below under at [...] "OH" [...] under Keset HaSofer, and they are very similar to what is found in the Tiberian masoretic codices.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} lines of evidence on the origin and utility of the dance <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the known species and races of honey bees exhibit the behavior, but details of its execution vary among the different species. For example, in Apis florea and Apis andreniformis (the [...] "dwarf honeybees") the dance is performed on the dorsal, horizontal portion of the nest, which is exposed. The runs and dances point directly toward the resource in these species. Each honey bee species has a characteristically different correlation of [...] "waggling" [...] to distance, as well. Such species-specific behavior suggests that this form of communication does not depend on learning but is rather determined genetically. It also suggests how the dance may have evolved.|$|E

2500|$|James {{also argued}} that, by the {{statutory}} canon of ejusdem generis, the catchall phrase {{should be read}} to include only completed crimes because the other crimes listed were completed crimes. [...] This was not so, the Court reasoned, because the category of crimes involving explosives {{was not limited to}} completed crimes. [...] "In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives is not 'completion'. [...] Rather, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury". [...] The broad residual provision was meant to sweep up other crimes that, like burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, posed a serious risk of physical injury to others.|$|E
2500|$|The rest of Dammeier's {{argument}} {{was devoted to}} the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that [...] "the truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{separating}} the proteins by mass, {{they are treated}} with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) along with other reagents (SDS-PAGE in 1-D). [...] This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length. [...] Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass. [...] Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, {{the result of this}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other. [...] In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the isoelectric focusing step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it [...] is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent needs to be used).|$|E
