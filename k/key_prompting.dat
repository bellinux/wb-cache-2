40|$|Live {{theater is}} {{typically}} designed {{to alter the}} state of mind of the audience. Indeed, the perceptual inputs issuing from a live theatrical performance are intended to represent something else, and the actions, emphasised by the writing and staging, are the <b>key</b> <b>prompting</b> the adhesion of viewers to fiction, i. e. their belief that it is real. This phenomenon raises {{the issue of the}} cognitive processes governing access to a fictional reality during live theater and of their cerebral underpinnings. To get insight into the physiological substrates of adhesion we recreated the peculiar context of watching live drama in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, with simultaneous recording of heart activity. The instants of adhesion were defined as the co-occurrence of theatrical events determined a priori by the stage director and the spectators’ offline reports of moments when fiction acted as reality. These data served to specify, for each spectator, individual fMRI time-series, used in a random-effect group analysis to define the pattern of brain response to theatrical events. The changes in this pattern related to subjects’ adhesion to fiction, were investigated using a region of interest analysis. The results showed that adhesion to theatrical events correlated with increased activity in the left BA 47 and pSTS, together with a decrease in dynamic heart rate variability, leading us to discuss the hypothesis of subtle changes in the subjects’ state of awareness, enabling them to mentally dissociate physical and mental (drama-viewing) experiences, to account for the phenomenon of adhesion to dramatic fiction...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Smokers with {{respiratory}} {{diseases are}} less likely to quit than those without impaired lung function, yet few studies have investigated the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions with this population, and none have used a computer-tailored approach. Aims: This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring smokers’ experiences when trying to quit and their perceptions of a computer-tailored intervention. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 smokers recruited from six GP practices in North London. Thematic analysis was conducted to examine participants’ previous experiences of quitting and their perceptions of receiving personal tailored feedback reports to aid smoking cessation. Results: Participants discussed how their positive smoking experiences coupled with their negative cessation experiences led to conflicts with quitting smoking. Although the computer-tailored intervention was <b>key</b> in <b>prompting</b> quit attempts and participants valued its personal approach; it was not sufficient as a stand-alone intervention. Conclusion: The results highlight the difficulties that smokers experience when quitting and the need for a more personalised stop smoking service in smokers with respiratory diseases.

40|$|Focusing {{on urban}} Kenya, this paper {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} sources of the temporal increase in women’s employment rate between 1986 and 1998. The paper relies on labour survey data, household responses to coping strategies and case studies. The analysis presented in the paper shows that the bulk of the increase in women’s insertion into the labour market comes from an increase in the work participation of married women. While women’s higher educational endowments, particularly the increase in secondary education, account for an improvement in their employment prospects, the period also witnesses a sharp decline in the importance given to education in determining employment and by 1998, university graduates were just as likely to be employed as individuals with no education. The period between 1986 and 1998 witnessed civil service reforms, restructuring of the private sector, firm closures and increasing job insecurity. Notwithstanding the role of education, declining opportunities for males, who in 1986 were the primary breadwinners and the accompanying income and employment insecurities within households seem to be the <b>key</b> factors <b>prompting</b> the sharp increase in the labour supply of (married) women. The analysis presented in this paper focused mainly on the period 1986 and 1998 and while more recent data would have provided an updated picture of the issues discussed in this paper, there is little evidence to suggest that the situation of women in Kenya’s labour market has changed substantially in recent years...|$|R

Geological Survey system referred to as PAGER, for the Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response. PAGER is an automated alarm system, currently in prototype operation. This is being further developed to rapidly and accurately assess the severity of damage caused by an earthquake and to provide emergency relief organizations, government agencies, and the media with {{an estimate of the}} societal impact from the potential catastrophe. Although the global ShakeMaps used for PAGER are constrained in part by rapidly gathered ground motion and intensity data via the Internet and with rupture dimensions resolved with automated finite fault analyses, they are fundamentally predictive, relying on our best e#orts at rapidly estimating ground motions. Such a task requires adaptation of a number of seismological tools that we discuss herein. These include the estimation of site amplification on a global basis, the automatic inclusion of strong motion data and macroseis-mic intensities, incorporating rupture finiteness (mainly rupture dimensions) derived from source modeling, and empirically predicting regionally specific ground motion amplitudes with corre-sponding instrumental intensities.

40|$|The altered {{expression}} of cell surface chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) in cancer cells {{has been demonstrated}} to {{play a key role}} in malignant transformation and tumor metastasis. However, the functional highly sulfated structures in CS/DS chains and their involvement in the process have not been well documented. In the present study, a structural analysis of CS/DS from two mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (3 LL) -derived cell lines with different metastatic potentials revealed a higher proportion of Delta(4, 5) HexUA-GalNAc(4, 6 -O-disulfate) generated from E-units (GlcUA-GalNAc(4, 6 -O-disulfate)) in highly metastatic LM 66 -H 11 cells than in low metastatic P 29 cells, although much less CS/DS is expressed by LM 66 -H 11 than P 29 cells. This <b>key</b> finding <b>prompted</b> us to study the role of CS-E-like structures in experimental lung metastasis. The metastasis of LM 66 -H 11 cells to lungs was effectively inhibited by enzymatic removal of tumor cell surface CS or by preadministration of CS-E rich in E-units in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, immunocytochemical analysis showed that LM 66 -H 11 rather than P 29 cells expressed more strongly the CS-E epitope, which was specifically recognized by the phage display antibody GD 3 G 7. More importantly, this antibody and a CS-E decasaccharide fraction, the minimal structure recognized by GD 3 G 7, strongly inhibited the metastasis of LM 66 -H 11 cells probably by modifying the proliferative and invading behavior of the metastatic tumor cells. These results suggest that the E-unit-containing epitopes are involved in the metastatic process and a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors...|$|R

R 2 P has undeniably changed the discourse surrounding humanitarian intervention, and possibly broadened interest in the subject, but it has contributed little of substance or prescriptive merit. Though the report was drafted with the mandate to reconcile international human rights with state sovereignty it fudged the key issues, namely, substantive reform of the United Nations Security Council, the legitimacy of unilateral humanitarian intervention and the threshold for intervention.

40|$|A new prompt {{fission neutron}} {{spectrum}} matrix for the n+ 235 U system is proposed. The thermal neutron spectrum is this matrix describes the newest data of JRC IRMM by Hambsch et al. (2009). The longstanding problem of inconsistency of integral thermal data testing and differential prompt fission neutron spectra data (PFNS) {{seems to be}} solved. It was mostly due to rather poor fits of differential PFNS data in major data libraries. The older measured database is updated here using modern standards like spontaneous fission neutron spectra of 252 Cf(sf). That largely removes the inconsistency of older thermal neutron-induced PFNS data with the newest data. A phenomenological approach, developed by Kornilov et al. (1999), for the first-chance fission and extended for the emissive fission domain by Maslov et al. (2005) is normalized at Eth to predict both the PFNS average energy E and PFNS shape up to 20 MeV. In the first-chance and emissive fission domain evaluated PFNS {{are consistent with the}} E data by Ethvignot et al. (2005). A compiled ENDF/B-formatted file of the 235 U(n,F) PFNS largely removes the inconsistencies of the evaluated differential PFNS with integral data benchmarks. Fast integral critical experiments like GODIVA or Flattop benchmarks are reproduced with the same accuracy as with the PFNS of the major data libraries. That reveals a rather delicate compensation effect, since present and previous PFNS shapes are drastically different from each other. Thermal assembly benchmarking reveals positive biases in keff, which might be attributed to the influence of a soft energy tail of the present PFNS.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that survey {{respondents}} reduce the effort they invest in answering questions by taking mental shortcuts – survey satisficing. This is a concern because such shortcuts can reduce the quality of responses and, potentially, the accuracy of survey estimates. This article explores “speeding,” an extreme type of satisficing, which we define as answering so quickly that respondents cannot give much, if any, thought to their answers. We test an interactive prompting technique designed to reduce speeding among online respondents. When respondents answered faster than a minimal response time threshold, they received a message encouraging them to answer carefully and take their time. Across six web survey experiments, this prompting technique reduced speeding on subsequent questions compared to a no prompt control. Prompting slowed response times whether the speeding that triggered the prompt occurred early or late in the questionnaire, in the first or later waves of a longitudinal survey, among respondents recruited from non-probability or probability panels, or whether the prompt was delivered on only the first or on all speeding episodes. In addition to reducing speeding, the prompts increased response accuracy on simple arithmetic questions for a <b>key</b> subgroup. <b>Prompting</b> also reduced later straightlining in one experiment, suggesting the benefits may generalize to other types of mental shortcuts. Although the prompting could have annoyed respondents, it was not accompanied by a noticeable increase in breakoffs. As an alternative technique, respondents in one experiment were asked to explicitly commit to respond careful. This global technique complemented the more local, interactive prompting technique on several measures. Taken together, these results suggest that interactive interventions of this sort may be useful for increasing respondents’ conscientiousness in online questionnaires, even though they are self-administered...|$|R
