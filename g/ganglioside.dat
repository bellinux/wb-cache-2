5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain <b>ganglioside</b> accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A <b>ganglioside</b> is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E

To date, there is very little information available on the direct analysis of <b>gangliosides</b> in brain tissue. One major hurdle for imaging <b>gangliosides</b> in tissue using mass spectrometry is that sialic acid residues can be dissociated in ionization process. In this report, we investigated an ionic liquid matrix for mass spectrometry imaging of <b>gangliosides.</b> This ionic liquid matrix offered excellent sensitivity for detection <b>gangliosides</b> without significant loss of sialic acid residues.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{exogenous}} <b>gangliosides</b> on {{the occurrence of}} domes in MDCK cell cultures was investigated {{in view of the}} involvement of both dome formation and <b>gangliosides</b> in cell growth, differentiation and transepithelial transport. Dome formation was increased by <b>gangliosides</b> in medium free of fetal calf serum. Among the <b>gangliosides</b> tested, GM 3 and GD 3 isolated from porcine kidney were most active, increasing the dome number 12 – 17 -fold. Since <b>gangliosides</b> from kidney were more active than those from brain and erythrocytes, the hydrophobic moiety as well as sialic acid might be involved in this activity. These results indicate that tissue-specific molecules of <b>gangliosides</b> function as inducers or mediators of dome formation.

40|$|Cell {{membrane}} <b>gangliosides</b> {{have been}} shown to be involved in a number of biological processes including cell adhesion, signal transduction and ligand receptor interactions. In this paper we analyzed the effects of a mixture of bovine brain <b>gangliosides,</b> currently in clinical use, on cell mediated immune responses in vitro. We show here that exogenous <b>gangliosides</b> inhibit mitogen and alloantigen induced lymphoproliferation. On the other hand effects on antigen induced blastogenesis were exquisitely dose dependent in that while high doses of <b>gangliosides</b> inhibited lymphoproliferation, probably by interfering in interleukin 2 receptor interactions, lower doses significantly enhanced antigen induced responsiveness. We also report that <b>gangliosides</b> inhibit the generation of lymphokine activated killer cells.

25|$|The GM2A gene {{provides}} {{instructions for}} making a protein called the GM2 activator. This protein {{is required for the}} normal function of beta-hexosaminidase A, a critical enzyme in the nervous system that breaks down a lipid called GM2 <b>ganglioside.</b> If mutations in both alleles at this locus disrupt the activity of the GM2 activator, beta-hexosaminidase A cannot perform its normal function. As a result, gangliosides accumulate in the central nervous system until they interfere with normal biological processes. Progressive damage caused by buildup of gangliosides leads to the destruction of nerve cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency {{in any one of}} these proteins leads to <b>ganglioside</b> storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E
25|$|Tay–Sachs disease {{exists in}} Jacob sheep. The {{biochemical}} mechanism for this {{disease in the}} Jacob sheep is virtually identical to that in humans, wherein diminished activity of hexosaminidaseA results in increased concentrations of GM2 <b>ganglioside</b> in the affected animal. Sequencing of the HEXA gene cDNA of affected Jacobs sheep reveal an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in the human HEXA gene, and 86% nucleotide sequence identity. A missense mutation (G444R) {{was found in the}} HEXA cDNA of the affected sheep. This mutation is a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11, resulting in that exon's deletion (before translation) via splicing. The Tay–Sachs model provided by the Jacob sheep is the first to offer promise as a means for gene therapy clinical trials, which may prove useful for disease treatment in humans.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} alpha and beta {{subunits}} of hexosaminidase A can both cleave GalNAc residues, only the alpha subunit {{is able to}} hydrolyze GM2 <b>gangliosides.</b> The alpha subunit contains a key residue, Arg-424, which is essential for binding the N-acetyl-neuramanic residue of GM2 <b>gangliosides.</b> The alpha subunit can hydrolyze GM2 <b>gangliosides</b> because it contains a loop structure consisting of the amino acids: Gly-280, Ser-281, Glu-282, and Pro-283. The loop is absent in the beta subunit, but it serves as an ideal structure for the binding of the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) in the alpha subunit. A combination of Arg-424 and the amino acids that cause {{the formation of the}} loop allow the alpha subunit to hydrolyze GM2 <b>gangliosides</b> into GM3 <b>gangliosides</b> by removing the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue from GM2 <b>gangliosides.</b>|$|R
25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is <b>ganglioside</b> GM1.

Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms.|$|E

We have investigated the effect of <b>gangliosides</b> on the interaction of IL- 2 with its cell surface receptors (IL- 2 R). <b>Gangliosides</b> inhibited IL- 2 -stimulated proliferation in synchronized populations of the IL- 2 -dependent cell lines CTLL- 2 and HT- 2. The immunosuppressive effect was most effective when <b>gangliosides</b> were added during the first 4 hr after IL- 2 -stimulation, indicating that they acted early in the IL- 2 signalling pathway.

In support of this proposal, <b>gangliosides</b> induced a concomitant dose-dependent decrease in binding of [125 I]IL- 2 to high-, medium- and low-affinity IL- 2 R. Ganglioside-treated cells recovered their high-affinity [125 I]IL- 2 binding after washing.

A thin-layer chromatography overlay technique was used to demonstrate that IL- 2 binds directly to <b>gangliosides,</b> but not to simple neutral glycolipids or acidic lipids.
