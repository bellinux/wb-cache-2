500|$|... "Training Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Annie Wu applauded the episode in her review for TV Squad. Wu dispensed {{that the best}} part was the writing, and acted as [...] "a [...] prime example of how ridiculously rapid-fire the conversations can get." [...] She singled out the scene where Archer gives an [...] "oddly specific" [...] situation as to when he would utilize a gun hidden in his underwear. Wu opined that she [...] "loved" [...] Jessica Walter's performance as Malory, declaring that she [...] "wins this episode" [...] with lines such as [...] "Immigrants! That's how they do, y'know. <b>Just</b> <b>drive</b> around, listening to raps and shooting all the jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{police officer}} interrogates Parker (Julie Gonzalo) about her rape, {{but she does}} not {{remember}} any of it. Veronica tells Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that she ran into the room and heard Parker having sex, and Parker berates her for not checking to see what was happening. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) hikes through the desert after fleeing from Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe); Cormac later realizes that Keith has disappeared and starts following him. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Logan's (Jason Dohring) sociology professor recruits volunteers for a Stanford prison experiment-like study. Veronica interviews for a photography position at the college newspaper, but the editor tasks her with writing an exposé of the Theta Beta sorority, where Parker was during the night of her rape. Parker’s parents appear at Hearst and announce {{that they are going to}} remove her from the college in light of her assault. During her investigation, Veronica poses as a potential recruit, {{but she does not}} note any suspicious activity. In the sociology experiment, Logan is assigned to the role of a prisoner, while Wallace acts as a [...] "guard". While tracking Keith, Cormac gets stuck in a bear trap; his brother Liam (Rod Rowland) appears and shoots him. Veronica is invited to attend a [...] "private party", which she believes will be the key to her exposé. At the party, Veronica encounters Dick (Ryan Hansen) and learns that Parker's room was easily accessible. Veronica pretends to be drunk in order to ascertain whether or not the sorority members collaborate with the rapist, but they <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> her home.|$|E
2500|$|Production began for {{the film}} on June 5, 2012. Reitman and the film's art {{director}} Steve Saklad searched a number of houses in Massachusetts {{as most of the}} film is set inside the Wheelers' home. According to Reitman, [...] "We searched the entire state of Massachusetts for that house. My location manager has never looked at that many locations looking for one place. For weeks we would <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> down the street, knocking on people’s doors. The house we found was perfect but it was very modern. Steve brought it back to 1987." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, Famitsu {{gave it a}} {{score of}} one eight, one nine, one ten, and one nine {{for a total of}} 36 out of 40. One {{reviewer}} said, [...] "The way you participate in events and run races on public roads serves well as a new direction for the series. [...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it fun to <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> around, but I still wish there was something more unique to this game. I have to give top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used to be a really stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up. I feel like the controls are more forgiving, too, and the open-world freedom makes the whole thing a lot more approachable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Morgan {{claimed that}} during his {{publicity}} tour he flew the B-17 between the Buncombe County Courthouse and the City Hall of Asheville, North Carolina, his home town. Morgan wrote that after leaving a local airport {{he decided to}} buzz the town, telling his copilot, Captain Verinis, [...] "I think we'll <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> up over the city {{and give them a}} little goodbye salute." [...] Morgan turned the bomber down Patton Avenue, a main thoroughfare, toward downtown Asheville. When he observed the courthouse and the city hall (two tall buildings that are only about 50ft (20 m) apart) dead ahead, he lowered his left wing in a 60 degree bank and flew between the structures. He wrote that the city hall housed an AAF weather detachment whose commanding officer allegedly complained immediately to the Pentagon, but was advised by a duty officer that [...] "Major Morgan...has been given permission to buzz by General Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanks studied {{theater at}} Chabot College in Hayward, California, and {{transferred}} to California State University, Sacramento, two years later. [...] "Famous alumni*: Actor Tom Hanks...Includes former students who attended– but didn't graduate from– the university"— ¶ 67. [...] During a 2001 interview with Bob Costas, Hank was asked whether he would have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. Hank replied he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears. Hanks told New York magazine in 1986, [...] "Acting classes looked like {{the best place for}} a guy who liked {{to make a lot of}} noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, and all that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|The actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's {{bodyguard}} {{and assistant}} for several years, {{and was a}} friend of the singer. He stated, [...] "The last time my father left his house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time... was with Michael Jackson. He loved it... He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service." [...] "Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. For that I will always be indebted to him. Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days, and he was on oxygen much of the time. He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. Dad could name all the trees there, and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and see them all, it's such a big place. So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland. They'd <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> around—Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando, with an oxygen tank in a golf cart." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is different, you know. I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do. I'll <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> slap over to Harrington and chance it. I'll take the two bays in the phaeton. Who's afraid?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is the man}} {{who wants}} to sell us the car," [...] he exclaimed, turning towards the girl, [...] "but I haven't even seen it yet.

60|$|But the Queen was an {{extremely}} clever woman, who could do {{a great deal more}} than <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> in a coach. She took her great golden scissors, cut up a piece of silk, and made a pretty little bag of it. This she filled with the finest buckwheat grains, and tied it round the Princess' neck; this done, she cut a little hole in the bag, so that the grains would strew the whole road wherever the Princess went.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yuh, but say, {{any of you}} fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago? I don't want to knock--I {{believe in}} {{boosting}} wherever you can--but say, of all the rotten dumps that pass 'emselves off as first-class hotels, that's the worst. I'm going to get those guys, one of these days, and I told 'em so. You know how I am--well, maybe you don't know, but I'm accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I'm perfectly {{willing to pay a}} reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the other night, and the Rippleton's near the station--I'd never been there before, but I says to the taxi-driver--I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it's worth it when you got to be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs--and I said to him, 'Oh, <b>just</b> <b>drive</b> me over to the Rippleton.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp {{shook her}} head. It was so hot. Could they <b>just</b> <b>drive,</b> and then perhaps {{sit in the}} park? That would be lovely. It had gone dark, {{and the air was}} not quite so exhausted--a little {{freshness}} of scent from the trees in the squares and parks mingled with the fumes of dung and petrol. Winton gave the same order he had given that long past evening: [...] "Knightsbridge Gate." [...] It had been a hansom then, and the night air had blown in their faces, instead of as now in these infernal taxis, down the back of one's neck. They left the cab and crossed the Row; passed the end of the Long Water, up among the trees. There, on two chairs covered by Winton's coat, they sat side by side. No dew was falling yet; the heavy leaves hung unstirring; the air was warm, sweet-smelling. Blotted against trees or on the grass were other couples darker than the darkness, very silent. All was quiet save for the never-ceasing hum of traffic. From Winton's lips, the cigar smoke wreathed and curled. He was dreaming. The cigar between his teeth trembled; a long ash fell. Mechanically he raised his hand to brush it off--his right hand! A voice said softly in his ear: ...|$|E
