500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it. We just want to be in control of our own music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence {{had first}} {{arrived at the}} Spade Ranch in 1909 {{at the age of}} {{thirteen}} and grew up observing and working for its owners. In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano in the wagon. [...] "I'll <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd {{and with the help of}} a neighbor they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he would tell us wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. We stopped at the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove what we knew had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E

I think you'd better go to Camperdown, and give them up to him, and tell him the truth." [...] Then she sobbed more violently than before, till her quick ear caught the sound of a footstep on the stairs, and in a moment she was out of his arms and seated on the sofa, with hardly a trace of tears in her eyes. It was the footman, who desired to know whether Lady Eustace would want the carriage that afternoon. Lady Eustace, with her cheeriest voice, sent her love to Mrs. Carbuncle, and her assurance that she would not want the carriage before the evening.

60|$|There {{were certain}} houses at Eckleton which had, as it were, {{specialised}} in certain competitions. Thus, Gay's, who never {{by any chance}} survived {{the first two rounds}} of the cricket and football housers, invariably won the shooting shield. All the other houses sent their brace of men to the range to see what they could do, but every year it was the same. A pair of weedy obscurities from Gay's would take the shield by a comfortable margin. In the same way Mulholland's had only won the cricket cup once since they had become a house, but they had carried off the swimming cup three years in succession, and six years in all out of the last eight. The sports had always been looked on as the perquisite of the School House; and this year, with Milligan to win the long distances, and Maybury the high jump and the weight, there did not seem much doubt at their success. These two alone would pile up fifteen points. Three points were given for a win, two for second place, and one for third. It was this that encouraged Kennedy in the hope that Dencroft's might have a chance. Nobody in the house could beat Milligan or Maybury, but the School House second and third strings were not so invincible. If Dencroft's, by means of second and third places in the long races and the other events which were certainties for their opponents, could hold the School House, Fenn's sprinting might <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the cup. In the meantime they trained hard, but in an unobtrusive fashion which aroused no fear in School House circles.|$|E

[...] She stops at a faint, soft sound on the door. [...] "It's Maggie with her hands so full she's pushing with her elbow. Come in, Maggie, come in. Come in! Don't you hear me? Come in, I say! Oh, it isn't Maggie, of course! It's those worthless, worthless little wretches, again." [...] She runs to the door calling out, [...] "Naughty, naughty, naughty!" [...] as she runs. Then, flinging the door wide, with a final cry of [...] "Naughty, I say!" [...] she discovers a small figure on the threshold, nightgowned to its feet, and looking up with a frightened, wistful face. [...] "Why, Benny!" [...] She stoops down and catches the child in her arms, and presses him tight to her neck, and bends over, covering his head with kisses. [...] "What {{in the world are}} you doing here, you poor little lamb? Is mother's darling walking in his sleep? What did you want, my pet? Tell mudda, do! Whisper it in mudda's big ear! Can't you tell mudda? What? Whisper a little louder, love! We're not angry with you, sweetness. Now, try to speak louder. Is that Santa Claus? No, dearest, that's just dadda. Santa Claus hasn't come yet, but he will soon. What? Say it again. Is there any Santa Claus? Why, who else could have brought all these presents? Presents for Benny and Jim and Susy and mudda, and seven bath-gowns for dadda. Isn't that funny? Seven! And one for mudda. What? I can't quite hear you, pet. Are we going to send the presents back? Why, who ever heard of such a thing? Jim said so? And Susy? Well, I will settle with them, when I come to them. You don't want me to? Well, I won't, then, if Benny doesn't want mudda to. I'll <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a kiss apiece, pop in their big ears. What? You've got something for Santa Claus to give them? What? Where? In your crib? And shall we go and get it? For mudda too? And dadda? Oh, my little angel!" [...] She begins to cry over him, and to kiss him again. [...] "You'll break my heart with your loveliness. He wants to kiss you too, dadda." [...] She puts the boy into his father's arms; then catches him back and runs from the room with him. Fountain resumes the work of filling the long stocking he had begun with; then he takes up a very short sock. He has that in his hand when Mrs. Fountain comes back, wiping her eyes. [...] "He'll go to sleep now, I guess; he was half dreaming when he came in here. I should think, when you saw how Benny believed in it, you'd be ashamed of saying a word against Christmas." ...|$|E
