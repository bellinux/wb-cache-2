5|$|<b>Inbreeding</b> {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, <b>inbreeding</b> is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger Species Survival Plan has {{condemned}} the breeding of white tigers, alleging {{they are of}} mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage. The genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population. The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to <b>inbreeding</b> among homozygous recessive individuals. This would lead to <b>inbreeding</b> depression and loss of genetic variability.|$|E
5|$|Darwin’s finch Geospiza scandens {{experiences}} <b>inbreeding</b> depression (reduced {{survival of}} offspring) and {{the magnitude of}} this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inbreeding</b> to Secretariat {{has also}} proven successful, as {{exemplified}} by numerous graded stakes winners, including two-time Horse of the Year Wise Dan, as well as sprint champion Speightstown.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas pocket gopher have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there is substantial genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited <b>inbreeding</b> within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's pocket gopher and the southern pocket gopher, {{both of which are}} members of the same genus. However, it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird's pocket gopher and the plains pocket gopher, members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of <b>inbreeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no <b>inbreeding</b> visible in the table above, four of the horses in the fourth {{generation}} (Narsullah, Hail To Reason, Nearctic and Nangela) are direct descendants of Nearco, who as a result appears twice in the fifth, and twice in the sixth generation of Fantastic Light's extended pedigree.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, <b>inbreeding</b> increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as <b>inbreeding</b> depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|As the Bankers {{are seen}} as a part of North Carolina's coastal heritage, they have been allowed to remain on the barrier islands. To cope with the {{expanding}} population, prevent <b>inbreeding</b> and attempt to minimize environmental damage, several organizations partner in managing the herds.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe guttata is pollinated by bees, such as Bombus impatiens. <b>Inbreeding</b> reduces flower {{quantity}} and size and pollen quality and quantity. E. guttata also displays {{a high degree}} of self-pollination. Erythranthe nasuta evolved from E. guttata in central California between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago and since then has become primarily a self-pollinator.|$|E
5|$|Small {{groups of}} animals with little {{opportunity}} for exchange between them face {{the risk of}} <b>inbreeding,</b> decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clear-cutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} <b>inbreeding</b> on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and <b>inbreeding</b> could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|The Florida panther {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} mammals on earth. About 50 live in the wild, primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest threats to the panther include habitat destruction from human development, vehicle collisions, <b>inbreeding</b> due to their limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and mercury poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} has been {{classified}} as Endangered by the IUCN because its wild population {{is estimated at}} less than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and <b>inbreeding</b> depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries.|$|E
5|$|The sarus crane is {{classified}} as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Threats include habitat destruction and/or degradation, hunting and collecting, as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species. The effects of <b>inbreeding</b> in the Australian population {{may need to be}} studied.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the IUCN, because of its {{abundance}} and presumably stable population. However, the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of <b>inbreeding</b> and morphological abnormalities in some populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of <b>inbreeding,</b> Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism {{was observed}} in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous <b>inbreeding</b> could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E
5|$|Although the Haflinger is {{now found}} {{all over the}} world, the {{majority}} of breeding stock still comes from Austria, where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain {{the quality of the}} breed. However, there are breeding farms located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little <b>inbreeding</b> within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer breeding stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy and Picardy, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although there was a very small amount of <b>inbreeding</b> in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years. As of 2005 there were almost 250,000Haflingers in the world.|$|E
5|$|Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, {{while the}} rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some <b>inbreeding</b> occurred, both by {{accident}} and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Breeding convicts is {{as simple}} as having a male and a female in the same tank with {{adequate}} water quality and feeding. There is no special conditioning required. Due to their prolific breeding in captivity, there is a very low demand for Convict fry, and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an <b>inbreeding</b> population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck—about an Aylesbury duck {{although}} set in Cumbria—caused {{renewed interest in}} the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline. The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and <b>inbreeding</b> had dangerously weakened the breed. Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19thcentury, and from 1873 onwards competition from Pekin and Pekin cross ducks was undercutting Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by <b>inbreeding.</b> This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to <b>inbreeding,</b> {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, <b>inbreeding,</b> and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme {{presented}} a new management {{plan that would}} run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of individuals {{can be expected to}} result in <b>inbreeding</b> depression), maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E
5|$|Sumatran {{rhinoceroses}} {{were once}} quite numerous throughout Southeast Asia. Fewer than 100 individuals are now estimated to remain. The species is classed as critically endangered (primarily due to illegal poaching) while the last survey in 2008 estimated that around 250 individuals survived. From the early 1990s, the population decline {{was estimated at}} more than 50% per decade, and the small, scattered populations now face high risks of <b>inbreeding</b> depression. Most remaining habitat is in relatively inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The second mode of {{speciation}} is peripatric speciation, {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become isolated {{in a new}} environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically {{much smaller than the}} parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in <b>inbreeding</b> increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of <b>inbreeding</b> and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{overpopulation}} and <b>inbreeding,</b> and {{to protect}} their habitat from being overgrazed, the horses are managed by the National Park Service, the state of North Carolina, and several private organizations. The horses are monitored for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} <b>inbreeding.</b> This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|A {{studbook}} {{was created}} for the breed in 1884, and was closed in 1922. A breeders' association was created in 1923. The {{first half of the}} 20th century saw declining populations of horses and mules due to increased mechanization, and, by 1945, Poitevin breeding was oriented towards the production of meat. The population dropped precipitously, and between 1970 and 1990 varied between 250 and 300 animals, with still lower levels seen in the early 1990s. A genetic study released in 1994 showed genetic bottlenecking and a severe risk of <b>inbreeding,</b> and led to the establishment of a conservation plan. Despite a slight increase in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, the Poitevin is still in danger of extinction, with a slightly downward-trending population.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that <b>inbreeding</b> could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, {{the agents}} {{discover}} that the baby suffocated by inhaling dirt—meaning it was buried alive. Scully suggests that the baby's defects could {{have been caused by}} <b>inbreeding.</b> Mulder insists this would be impossible, since the Peacocks seem to live in an all-male household. Suspecting that the Peacocks have kidnapped and raped a woman, Mulder and Scully investigate their now-abandoned residence and discover blood, scissors, and a shovel on a table. Arrest warrants are issued for the three brothers. In retaliation, the Peacocks break into Sheriff Taylor's house during the night and murder him and his wife.|$|E
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood), Mulder asks whether the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been <b>inbreeding</b> since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{because of}} the {{relatively}} limited number of potential consorts, the gene pool of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was infamous for <b>inbreeding,</b> with the Habsburg lip cited as an ill effect, although no genetic evidence has proved the allegation. The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also engaged in first-cousin unions frequently and in double-cousin and uncle-niece marriages occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Population {{numbers for}} the Castillonnais are quite low. The {{majority}} of breeders are located in Castillon-en-Couserans, in Ariège, but a few {{can be found in}} Brittany and Provence. In November 2005, there were only around 260 existing Castillonnais, and a goal was created by the breed association to double the number of purebred mares between 2005 and 2014. <b>Inbreeding</b> is a concern due to low population numbers, and the national stud farm at Tarbes and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (National Institute of Agronomic Research) have been brought in to help safeguard the genetic resources of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid <b>inbreeding.</b> This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
