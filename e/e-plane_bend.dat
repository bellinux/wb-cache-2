40|$|Abstract—The SIW (substrate {{integrated}} waveguide) technol-ogy {{makes use}} of metal vias in a dielectric substrate, electrically connecting two parallel metal plates, to make a waveguide. The main advantages of SIW are simple geometry, low manufacture cost and integratability with MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuit) or other circuits. It is often required to have <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend</b> components in the whole SIW circuits or antenna systems for the integration, for example, in multilayer configurations. However, {{it is difficult to}} make an <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend</b> by using only SIW technology. We present a new solution to <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend</b> for SIW circuits and antennas by combining the SIW technology and the so-called gap waveguide (or gapwave) technology in the paper, with the latter also realized in PCB (printed circuit board) technology, and therefore keeping its above-mentioned advantages...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{rigorous}} differential method describing {{the propagation of}} an electromagnetic wave in an elementary mitred bent waveguide (H- and E-planes). Maxwell's equations are used in tensorial form, written in a nonorthogonal coordinate system where the boundary surfaces coincide with coordinate surfaces. Therefore, the expression of boundary conditions on the perfectly conducting walls becomes simplified. The electric and magnetic fields are expanded on trigonometric series, which satisfy the boundary conditions. For this problem, the interesting results are the magnitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted modes (transverse-electric modes for H-plane bend, longitudinal-section electric modes for <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend).</b> The transition conditions between the bent waveguide and access waveguides enable us to determine the scattering matrix of this structure. The knowledge of the scattering matrix enables us to simulate any uniform bent waveguides, even those with radii of curvature equal to zero...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{model for the}} analysis of an <b>E-plane</b> right-angle <b>bend</b> in parallel-plate waveguide (PPW), with a single square step for matching purposes. This design can achieve wideband matching and can be implemented using hollow waveguides as well as multilayer printed circuit boards. An even- and odd-mode analysis is performed exploiting the symmetry of the structure. Two auxiliary problems are defined considering the bisecting plane of the bend as a perfect electric conductor or a perfect magnetic conductor, respectively. They are solved using a mode matching method. The mathematical derivations are discussed in detail. The proposed procedure can be embedded in efficient tools {{for the analysis of}} complex PPW systems, such as feed networks for antenna arrays...|$|R
40|$|Waveguide-fed plastic horn antennas {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} for W-band applications using a versatile and cost-effective micro hot embossing process. The three-dimensional (3 D) polymer structure with internally coated conductor is composed of a pyramidal horn, an <b>E-plane</b> waveguide <b>bend,</b> two resonant cavities for impedance matching and a connecting rectangular waveguide. Measurement results show broadband characteristics in W-band with a return loss of better than – 10 dB; the bandwidth is 25. 2 GHz between 76. 5 and 101. 7 GHz (26. 5 %), and the 3 dB beam widths of the E- and H-plane gain patterns at 95 GHz are 26 ◦ and 23 ◦, respectively. The antenna gain is 17. 04 dB at 95 GHz and the cross-polarization discriminations for E- and H-plane are 19. 5 dB and 22. 2 dB, respectively.

40|$|The {{design of}} 3 D {{microwave}} devices {{can be improved}} by using computational optimization techniques combined with numerical simulations of the electromagnetic field. However, high accuracy field analysis is often computationally expensive and time consuming. One way to cut costs is to vary the accuracy level of the analysis {{at different stages of}} the optimization. This idea is {{based on the premise that}} the accuracy need not be constant throughout the optimization, and so the numerical analysis can be run more cheaply without compromising design quality. This thesis presents a software system that minimizes the return loss of 3 D microwave devices over a frequency band efficiently through accuracy control. It combines a custom gradient-based optimizer with a p-adaptive frequency-domain finite element solver. The solver computes the cost function and its gradient to a specified accuracy in a cost efficient manner. The p-adaptive solver comprises of two original components: an a-posteriori error estimator to evaluate the error in the cost function gradient, and an error indicator to identify the high error regions in the mesh. The optimizer controls the accuracy of the cost function evaluation through a link with the solver, specifying the required relative error for the gradient at each optimization step. The combined adaption-optimization scheme was applied to 3 D rectangular waveguide problems for validation: an <b>E-plane</b> miter <b>bend,</b> a U-bend, an impedance transformer and a compensated magic-T. For comparison, all the problems were also optimized using high-order finite elements at every step. Test results prove the computational efficiency of the new combined scheme at various stages of the optimization. In the early stages, when the element orders are low, the scheme is able to attain similar cost function reductions as the high-order analysis, with computational savings up to a factor of 25. Even in the late stages, when the accuracy is more stringent, the scheme manages a reduction in cumulative computation time of at least a factor of 4...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{microwave}} tubes, such as klystron, traveling-wave tube, gyrotron {{are high}} efficiency devices, where the RF interaction structure facilitates efficient energy transfer from the kinetic {{energy of the}} high energy electron beam to the electromagnetic wave. Traveling-wave Tube is the most versatile microwave power amplifier widely used for terrestrial communication, radar and aerospace applications. The waveguide based slow-wave structures like Millman, Karp, inter digital, grated waveguide, ring-plane, ring-bar, millitron and folded-waveguide structure gathered importance for application in millimeter-wave traveling-wave tubes. Among these millimeter-wave interaction structures, the folded-waveguide slow-wave structure became the most popular due to its robust structure, high power capability, low RF loss, simpler coupling, reasonably wide bandwidth and ease of fabrication for millimeter-wave to terahertz frequencies. Hence this thesis aims to analyse the folded-waveguide slow-wave structure for broad-banding and efficiency enhancement. The existing approaches {{for the analysis of}} cold circuit parameters (dispersion and interaction impedance characteristics) of folded-waveguide slow-wave structure are reinvestigated and found that these have limitation, as the effects of <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend</b> and beam-hole discontinuities are ignored in the parametric analysis. A cascaded matrix equivalent circuit model includes the effect of E-plane and beam-hole discontinuities for the analysis, but reported only for the serpentine folded-waveguide slow-wave structure. The cold test measurement technique was reported only for the dispersion characteristics. Hence the measurement technique has to be extended for the measurement of interaction impedance. The author proposes to orient the present doctoral work to (i) extend the proposed cascaded transmission matrix equivalent model for the analysis of rectangular folded-waveguide slow-wave structure, (ii) develop a non-resonant perturbation technique for the measurement of interaction impedance characteristics of the folded-waveguide slow-wave structure and also to (iii) establish new analysis models for the folded-waveguide slow-wave structure. The effect of <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend</b> and beam-hole discontinuities on the RF characteristics have been considered and simple, yet accurate closed form expressions for the computation of dispersion and interaction impedance characteristics have been established by three different approaches namely: transmission line equivalent circuit model, conformal mapping equivalent circuit model and quasi-TEM approach. The analysis results are benchmarked against 3 -D electromagnetic modeling. The non-resonant perturbation theory is developed for the interaction impedance measurement. Typical Ka-band structures are fabricated by wire-EDM process and cold test measurements are carried out to benchmark the analysis approaches. The equivalent circuit models based on lumped circuit model are simpler than the cascaded matrix equivalent circuit model and can give closed form expressions for the prediction of dispersion and interaction impedance characteristics. The quasi-TEM approach can be extended for the complicated structure like ridge-loaded FWG-SWS. Broad-banding of the conventional folded-waveguide slow-wave structure is attempted by ridge-loading on the broad wall of the structure. The ridge-loaded folded-waveguide slow-wave structure is analyzed by parametric approach, cascaded transmission matrix equivalent circuit model and quasi-TEM approach and validated against numerical simulation. The analysis is extended for exploring the efficacy of the ridge-loading on broad-banding of the traveling-wave tube. Finally efficiency enhancement of the folded-waveguide slow-wave structure is attempted by introducing grating on the broad wall of the structure. The analysis is carried out by numerical simulation for exploring the efficacy of the grating on efficiency enhancement of the traveling-wave tube...|$|E
40|$|E-plane split-block {{waveguide}} {{construction is}} well suited to many millimeter-wave components, including power dividers, frequency multipliers, and single-ended, balanced and sideband-separating mixers [1]. Recent ALMA memos have described quadrature hybrids [2] and a matched power divider [3] suitable for split-block construction. This memo describes four additional waveguide elements {{which can be used}} as building blocks in more complex circuits: a compact H-plane bend, a short <b>E-plane</b> <b>bend,</b> a matched E-plane Y-junction, and a broadband transducer from full-height waveguide to quartz suspended stripline. The components are suitable for fabrication on a CNC milling machine using an end-mill of diameter equal to the waveguide height, and do not require the insertion of separate waveguide short-circuit pieces at the ends of waveguides. Prototype designs are given for WR- 10 waveguide (75 - 110 GHz), which can be scaled for any other waveguide size with the same 2 : 1 aspect ratio. 1. H-Plane Waveguide Bend A split-block H-plane waveguide bend allows coupling from a waveguide in the plane of the split to a waveguide perpendicular to the plane of the split. Such a bend allows waveguide circuits on different planes to be interconnected, thereby making complex circuits more compact. Two H-plane bends are described here, one with both waveguides of rectangular cross section, and the other with an oval waveguide perpendicular to the plane of the joint. These are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, with their characteristics as simulated by QuickWave [4], and with measurements for comparison in Fig. 1. Figures 3 and 4 show the dimensions of the two designs. In the first design, the rectangular waveguide perpendicular to the plane of the split can be fabricated as a cylindrical insert and pressed or soldered into the upper half of the block prior to machining the rest of the waveguide in that half. In the second design, the oval waveguide can be machined directly into the block with an end-mill, but the length of the oval waveguide is limited by the length of the milling cutter. Fig. 1.
