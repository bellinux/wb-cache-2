40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for optimum steering input determination of all-wheel <b>steer</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AWSV) on rough terrains. The framework computes the steering input which minimizes the tracking error for a given trajectory. Unlike previous methodologies of computing steering inputs of car-like vehicles, the proposed methodology depends explicitly on the vehicle dynamics and can be extended to vehicle having arbitrary number of steering inputs. A fully generic framework has been used to derive the vehicle dynamics and a non-linear programming based constrained optimization approach has been used to compute the steering input considering the instantaneous vehicle dynamics, no-slip and contact constraints of the <b>vehicle.</b> All Wheel <b>steer</b> <b>Vehicles</b> have a special parallel steering ability where the instantaneous centre of rotation (ICR) is at infinity. The proposed framework automatically enables the vehicle to choose between parallel steer and normal operation depending on the error with respect to the desired trajectory. The efficacy of the proposed framework is proved by extensive uneven terrain simulations, for trajectories with continuous or discontinuous velocity profile...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve their maneuverability, long {{vehicles}} are often equipped with several steerable axles. Coordinated control of the steerable axles is usually realized through fixed patterns via so-called steering programs that function as a multi-axle steering system.

In this paper, therefore, we will present developments that aim at providing an automated multi-axle steering system for articulated vehicles that has novel features, such as directional stability in lanes.

The newest technologies for improving driving safety consist of vehicle stability control systems that improve the directional stability and steerability of a vehicle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for camera-based navigation of a conventionally <b>steered</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The destination bearing, ob-tained by actively panning {{the camera to}} fixate on the destination, is the primary measurement. A steering sequence designed to di-rect a moving vehicle towards a visible destination is generated using an extension of predictive control techniques. A variable sampling interval, based on distance traveled instead of elapsed time, provides robustness to destination range errors. Additional robustness is achieved by incorporating non-linearities into the steering algorithm, ensuring that the moving vehicle originating from an awkward position and heading will not diverge from the destination. A two-stage extended Kalman filter, which uses the destination bearing angle and known vehicle motion, provides es-timates of range. A criterion for shifting {{the attention of the}} camera between intermediate destinations is presentrd. Simula-tion results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed steering algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of a single track vehicle model to describe the lateral vehicle dynamics is common for control applications. As a result of simplifications, the basic single track vehicle model uses different front and rear effective tyre characteristics, which are valid for one loading configuration only. A study is conducted for parameter identification of an enhanced single track model that uses a single tyre description for both axles. Accurate results are obtained using experimental data from steady state cornering, pseudo-random steer and lane change manoeuvres for two loading configurations. The identification method has been validated for 15 different vehicles, and {{the results show that}} the response is within the confidence interval of measured step <b>steer</b> <b>vehicle</b> responses. It is concluded that the proposed single track model is generally suitable for describing the vehicle response for different loading configurations when load dependencies are included in the tyre description and vehicle inertia properties...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modelling and simulation {{of a stable}} angle-based instability threat indicator for articulated off-road vehicles. First, a stable angle {{is represented by the}} vertical forces of four wheels and steering angle of an off-road articulated <b>steer</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Then a vehicle prototype model is built based on a specific wheel loader type and a tyre/terrain model. Finally, the prototype model and tyre/terrain model are imported to the multi-body dynamics analysis software-ADAMS to conduct a number of simulations using the stable angle-based instability threat indicator. Simulation results indicate that a stable angle of 80. 5 ° is the threshold angle for lateral instability, and a stable angle of 90 ° is the threshold angle for longitudinal instability of this model. Compared with the traditional instability indicating methods for off-road vehicles, the proposed stable angle-based method is more efficient and can deal with both lateral and longitudinal instability of an articulated vehicle effectively.
