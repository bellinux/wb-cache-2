60|$|<b>First,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not find}} it easy to express what I mean without putting down the very words--at least, not so as to be very intelligible.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must know}} the truth, Andrew," [...] she said impulsively. [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel miserably guilty for having sent Dick on a {{dangerous}} errand when I {{knew he was}} ill--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "yes--of course. What a fool I have been!" [...] {{and said}} no more until we had made another of our tripod struggles along the beach. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the {{connection}} of my story with that self-accusation.|$|E
6000|$|... "'And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love you, teacher,' she sobbed. 'It was all true, {{even if the}} {{minister}} wrote it <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love you with all my heart.' ...|$|R
60|$|The oath left my lips in my excitement—the <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe, in my life, unless “trouble it,” an expletive of my youth, be {{accounted}} an oath.|$|R
6000|$|A silence, {{and then}} Miss Ponsonby said, 'After all, my dear, though I thought quite {{otherwise}} at <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that, considering what the youth is, {{and how much}} attached he seems, you might safely continue the engagement.' ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} how to address my nice white parcel, for I never had heard the child's name. But after {{thinking}} over the matter, I remembered that she was the only girl there with yellow curls hanging down her back, so I decided to risk the cake with the above direction.|$|E
60|$|On several {{occasions}} Jan had sent animals to be doctored by this Sihamba, for {{she would not}} come out to attend to them whatever fee was offered to her. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not approve of it, but as she always cured the animals, whatever their ailments might be, I gave in on the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess, Allan," [...] {{he said in}} his American fashion, [...] "there is {{a mistake}} somewhere. To answer the last part of your {{question}} <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not leave you without a word; I gave a letter to that lame old Griqua gardener of yours, Jack, to be handed to you when you arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are sorrows, Mr. Thwaite, {{which no}} time can cure. You have triumphed, and {{can look forward}} to the pleasures of success. I have been foiled, and beaten, and broken to pieces. With me the last is worse even than the <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know that I can ever have another friend. Your father was my friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ben-Ahmed, I {{told you}} the truth at <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{know where she is}} hiding. <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> indeed, know some time ago, but the place of her abode has been changed, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know now. I may as well however say at once that, if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know, nothing that you can do would induce me to tell you where she hides. You may imprison, torture, or slay me if you choose, but in regard to Hester Sommers I am from this moment dumb!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The <b>first</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> after Claxton was put down, I caused A Divine Looking-Glass to {{be printed}} anew in 1661." ...|$|R
6000|$|By [...] "we" [...] I {{mean the}} American passengers. The first welcome {{discovery}} among the crowd wandering aimlessly and somewhat disconsolately about the decks was the cheerful {{face of a}} friend whom at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not recognize because of his amazing disguise in uniform. Hitherto he had been associated in my mind with dinner parties and clubs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have forgiven him," [...] Helen answered, smiling. [...] "Indeed, if I hadn't done so long since, {{it would}} be easy to forgive him now. At <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel dreadfully humiliated, but I soon saw what he had saved me from. And, of course, if he had kept his promise, I could not have married you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There she is, Miss Mary," [...] said Joe, {{pointing}} {{out of the}} window, his whole face in a glow, between joy and whiskey. [...] "It should be told to the deacon at once, that his last hours might be happier than some that he has passed lately. That's she--though, at <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have told me at <b>first,</b> Walter. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not blame you, but you should not do things on your own responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a contra danza; {{shall we}} give the snow-ladies another lesson? <b>First,</b> may <b>I</b> <b>do</b> myself the {{pleasure}} of getting you an ice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wasn't {{sure about}} her. Your aunt {{recommended}} her, and I {{thought you might}} not like--and at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what things ought to cost, nor how long they ought to last, {{and that was what}} I did sums for. Then when I did prove it, I saw only dishonesty in the kitchen, and extravagance and mismanagement of my own.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next {{moment we}} were round the turn {{and on a}} broad and grassy slope. And then I yelled. My men came running back to me in great alarm. It seems that at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing but shout, 'She has given the child into my hands! She has given the child into my hands!' The escort thought I had gone mad." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, {{although}} I had been alarmed at <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not particularly regret what had happened. At any rate, it saved me the bother of {{going over to}} the police-station at Mellborough. Still, the thought that he might even now be lurking about in the vicinity, with plenty of opportunities to provide a weapon for himself, was not altogether a pleasant one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if I {{run away}} with Mr. Lessingham, I {{certainly}} can't promise that I'll send cards out <b>first.</b> Whatever <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> impulse will probably decide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They wanted to, {{but were}} poor and had {{forgotten}} {{the exact location of}} the island where the treasure was hidden. Bahama Jack was a happy go lucky sort of a sailor and he came to this country and worked for a while on a lumber schooner running from Florida to Boston. Doranez also came to this country, but where he kept himself at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Kardinal {{stated that}} he does not like the song, and [...] "it was the <b>first</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that wasn't from the heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{grasp the}} fact that he was dying. The [...] "year to two" [...] of life that Washburn had allowed to him had somehow become {{converted}} in my mind to vague years, a fate with no immediate meaning; the meanwhile he himself appeared to grow from day to day in buoyancy. How could I know it was his great heart rising to his need.|$|E
60|$|So {{the steam}} would escape {{generally}} easily, and {{would only make}} a passing rattle, like the earthquake of which the famous jester Charles Selwyn {{said that it was}} quite a young one, so tame that you might have stroked it; like that which I myself once felt in the Pyrenees, which gave me very solemn thoughts after a while, though at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing but laugh at it; and I will tell you why.|$|E
60|$|Its {{motion was}} so swift, complex, and perfect that at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not see it}} as a machine, in spite of its {{metallic}} glitter. The fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>first</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>do,</b> Augusta, for {{it would}} be murder against one who has done no wrong, and I will not stain my soul with murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well uncle, I--a--the fact is, I {{have not}} {{thought much about}} that as yet. Of course, I never thought of the <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not forget your own remark, that the calling of a {{minister}} of the gospel of Christ is not, like other professions, to be adopted merely {{as a means of}} livelihood. Then, as to the second, I might perhaps manage that; but I don't think it would suit me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. Any one who {{addresses}} her must {{be prepared}} to explain himself fully. Nor ought he to hope to get much encouragement at <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that Lady Mary will bestow her heart till she is sure she can give it with safety." [...] There was an amount of falsehood in this which was proof at any rate of very strong friendship on the part of Lady Cantrip.|$|R
60|$|But {{the next}} Day, for I had the Honour to lodge in the Lady's Father's House, {{where it all}} happen'd; I say, the next Day my Lady begins with me upon the Subject, and that very smartly, so that <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know whether she was in jest or earnest: Ay, ay, says she, you Men make nothing of your Wives after you have them, {{alluding}} to the Discourse with Sir Edward the Night before.|$|E
60|$|Why does Otto seem {{to avoid}} me? Has he some secret sorrow that I cannot share? To-day {{he moved his}} camp-stool {{to the other side}} of the meadow. He was in the long grass behind an {{elderberry}} bush. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see him. I thought that he had hanged himself. But he said no. He had forgotten to get a rope. He had tried, he said, to shoot himself. But he had missed himself.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him incredulously. [...] "And yet they were sitting close together," [...] she said; [...] "so close that at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see her; {{apparently}} talking in the most private manner in a very public place. They surely looked very much like an engaged couple as I have noticed them. And old Jane has told me that everybody knows {{she is trying to}} trap him; and surely {{there is good reason to}} believe that she has succeeded." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>first</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{after we}} were left {{together}} alone, {{was to make a}} third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Help you {{to kill a}} sheep, ma'am?" [...] said Mrs Scholtz, with a shudder, [...] "I'll die <b>first!</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>do</b> it, and <b>I</b> wouldn't, for {{my weight}} in gold." ...|$|R
3000|$|The <b>first</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was {{attack the}} crap out of my teammate. I knew where his ships were, and I blew him out of the H 2 O.-Subject 54 [...]...|$|R
