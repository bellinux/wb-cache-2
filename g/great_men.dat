5|$|In June 1976, {{the last}} year of his life, Britten {{accepted}} a life peerage – the first composer so honoured – becoming Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk. After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We <b>Great</b> <b>Men,</b> for voices and orchestra based on a poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir and orchestra. In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We <b>Great</b> <b>Men.</b>|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of <b>great</b> <b>men</b> or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about <b>great</b> <b>men</b> and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
60|$|Then Hereward {{looked at}} {{the face of the}} <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> and felt at once that it was the face of the <b>greatest</b> <b>man</b> whom he had ever met.|$|R

6000|$|... "That was {{loyalty to}} me, yes, and loyalty to yourself," [...] Dick explained. [...] "You were mine until I ceased being the <b>greatest</b> <b>man</b> in the world. He then became the <b>greatest</b> <b>man</b> in the world." ...|$|R

25|$|He {{described}} {{the lives of}} thirty seven <b>great</b> <b>men</b> in his book that {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part dealt with men from Bengal, second and third parts with men from Bombay (renamed as Mumbai) and Madras (renamed as Chennai) respectively. He also wrote the biographies of <b>great</b> <b>men</b> like Guru Nanak, Guru Govind Singh, Nanda, Samartha Ramadas, Siddhartha, Vishnuvardhana, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Raja Ramamohana Roy, Kalidas and Vemana.|$|E
5000|$|President Hassan Rouhani praised Rafsanjani as a <b>great</b> <b>man</b> of the Islamic Revolution. [...] "The {{soul of the}} <b>great</b> <b>man</b> of the revolution, {{symbol of}} {{patience}} and resistance, has gone to Heaven", saying Rouhani on his Twitter.|$|R

60|$|The novelist smiled. He {{had been}} buttonholed {{by a very}} <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> which pleased him. He raised his voice a little. There were others {{standing}} around. He fancied himself already {{the centre of the}} group. He forgot the greatness of the <b>great</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R

25|$|By 1907, the {{magazine}} subscription reached four hundred. Under {{the heading of}} Swavishayam (English translation: own matters), Chilakamarti used to write some essays. He announced in {{the magazine}} that they will publish more bravery related stories, life history of <b>great</b> <b>men</b> from Maharashtra and three plays.|$|E
40|$|A former {{colleague}} of mine once remarked of James J. Hill, with some emphasis, {{that he was a}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>great</b> <b>man!</b> 2 ̆ 2 This statement seems subject to some qualifications, which my colleague did not provide, but which Claire Strom offers in Profiting from the Plains. Hill, the 2 ̆ 2 empire builder, 2 ̆ 2 was a <b>great</b> <b>man</b> with many shortcomings, {{not the least of which}} was his conception of himself as a <b>great</b> <b>man...</b>|$|R
50|$|The qasida {{was typical}} for major genres. The madih praised and honored a <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> while the martiyya or ritza commemorated {{the death of}} a <b>great</b> <b>man.</b> The satirical hiya or hichá {{ridiculed}} enemies, although this form is much more prominent in Arabic poetry.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{consider}} {{the life of}} that <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> Benjamin Robert Haydon, one of the <b>greatest</b> <b>men</b> England has ever produced...." [...] The audience heaved a sigh of relief; this was all as it should be. There was a burst of loud bravoing and clapping. Mr. Tillotson turned his dim eyes round the room, and smiled gratefully at the misty figures he beheld. [...] "That <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> Benjamin Robert Haydon," [...] he continued, [...] "whom I am proud to call my master and who, it rejoices my heart to see, still lives in your memory and esteem, that <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> {{one of the greatest}} that England has ever produced, led a life so deplorable that I cannot think of it without a tear." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{character}} called Drystan {{appears as}} one of Arthur's advisers {{at the end of}} The Dream of Rhonabwy, an early 13th-century tale in the Welsh prose collection known as the Mabinogion, and Iseult is listed along with other <b>great</b> <b>men</b> and women of Arthur's court in another, much earlier Mabinogion tale, Culhwch and Olwen.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} work Keechaka vadha, a stage play, {{was written}} in 1889; the last work Bammera Potana, an incomplete play, {{was written in}} 1946, {{the year in which}} Chilkamarti died. Another incomplete play Harischandra was also probably written in 1946. The works of Chilkamarti can be broadly classified into verses, plays, Prahasanas, novels, long stories and biographies of <b>great</b> <b>men</b> and autobiography.|$|E
25|$|Banville {{has written}} three trilogies: the first, The Revolutions Trilogy, focused on <b>great</b> <b>men</b> {{of science and}} {{consisted}} of Dr. Copernicus (1976), Kepler (1981), and The Newton Letter (1982). He said he became interested in Kepler and other men of science after reading Arthur Koestler's The Sleepwalkers. He realized that, like him, scientists were trying to impose order in their work.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be quite}} an {{undertaking}} to carry on all the work in America. Essentially, I am a <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> a rarity, as it were. I can't quite believe it myself, however, {{and that is why}} I struggle against playing the role of a <b>great</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Orson Welles {{said in an}} {{interview}} with Dick Cavett that [...] "Marshall is the <b>greatest</b> <b>man</b> I ever met...

25|$|New York University (under severe {{financial}} distress) {{was forced}} to sell the campus in 1973 to the City University of New York and it became Bronx Community College. Though the Hall's renown has itself faded, its architecture remains, and it stands as a secular national shrine not just to <b>great</b> <b>men</b> and women, but to Roman ideals of fame favored {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{sophisticated}} nor particularly interesting, English-Canadian historical {{writing was}} what it was: traditional, political, constitutional, at times sentimental, and too focused {{on the story of}} self-government, its development over time, and its ultimate achievement.... If it wasn't dry-as-dust constitutional history, it was after-dinner expressions of loyalty to Great Britain, heroic accounts of <b>great</b> <b>men,</b> and patriotic renderings of the Plains of Abraham and General Wolfe or of Queenston Heights and General Brock.|$|E
25|$|Virgil, Terence and Tacitus {{were three}} of the {{greatest}} writers/poets of their time. They wrote a multitude of books in their day. Virgil {{is well known for}} his tale The Aenid. In Constantia's time, not many knew how to speak Latin. Constantia studied Latin and was able to edit the works of these three <b>great</b> <b>men.</b> Many people were impressed by her editing skills. Constantia started editing when she was eighteen; by the time she completed these three edits she was only 24.|$|E

My crew is like its captain--it loves adventures and it loves success." ...|$|R
60|$|A little, portly priest {{moved forward}} with a smile of good-humoured pride, and an ecclesiastic of a very {{different}} stamp walked at his side. The latter was a <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> indeed, a very <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> though he had once toiled in comparative obscurity. Even Miss Gascoyne had apparently heard of him.|$|R
25|$|Knowing that Sicily's Norman {{aristocracy}} {{would not}} welcome a Hohenstaufen king, William made the aristocracy, {{and the important}} men of his court, promise to recognize Constance's succession if he died without direct heirs. Nevertheless, after his unexpected death in 1189 his cousin, (and Constance's nephew) Tancred, seized the throne. Tancred was illegitimate {{but he had the}} support of most of the <b>great</b> <b>men</b> of the kingdom such as Vice-Chancellor Matthew of Ajello. On the other hand Archbishop Walter of the Mill, and most of the aristocracy, supported Constance. Eventually however, Matthew was able to induce Walter, along with other barons, to support Tancred.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Kitty Hart was {{the partner}} of {{diplomatic}} historian Ivo John Lederer, {{and their relationship}} lasted 16 years until Lederer's death in 1998. In her later years, she kept company with the financier and art collector Roy Neuberger. She also widely performed her one-woman show in which she told anecdotes about the many <b>great</b> <b>men</b> in American musical theatre history whom she had personally known, notably George Gershwin who had proposed marriage (according to an interview in American Heritage magazine), Irving Berlin, Kurt Weill, Oscar Hammerstein, Alan Jay Lerner, and Frederick Loewe, interspersed {{with a few of}} the songs that made each of them famous.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} of La Fontaine’s enduring popularity is his appearance on a playing card {{from the second}} year of the French Revolution. In this pack royalty is displaced by the rationalist free-thinkers known as Philosophes, and the ironical fabulist figures as the King of Spades. He was no less popular at the Bourbon Restoration, as is evidenced by the royal commission of his statue. Besides that, there was the 1816 bronze commemorative medal depicting the poet’s head, designed by Jacques-Édouard Gatteaux , in the <b>Great</b> <b>Men</b> of France series. More recently there has been a sideways seated view of him in the Histoire de France series.|$|E
