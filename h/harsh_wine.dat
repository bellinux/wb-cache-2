40|$|Sulphur-containing {{compounds}} in wine have been extensively studied {{because of their}} effect on wine flavour and quality. In this study, an enzyme that degrades sulphur-containing amino acids was cloned and characterised from two Oenococcus oeni strains of oenological origins. The enzyme has features of a cystathionine-γ-lyase (EC 4. 4. 1. 1), a pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate-dependent enzyme catalysing an α,γ-elimination reaction of l-cystathionine to produce l-cysteine, α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Moreover, {{it was able to}} catalyse an α,β-elimination reaction producing homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia from l-cystathionine. An elimination reaction of l-cysteine and dl-homocysteine was also efficiently catalysed by the enzyme, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulphide. Furthermore, the ability to demethiolate methionine into methanethiol, an unfavourable volatile sulphur compound in terms of wine aroma, was observed. The findings of this work suggest that O. oeni seems to play a minor role in the production of volatile sulphur compounds during the vinification process as the optimal conditions were far from the <b>harsh</b> <b>wine</b> environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

In this study, the effect of ethanol addition (12 % vol/vol) on [i]O. oeni[/i] PSU- 1 has been evaluated using a transcriptomic and proteomic approach. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the main functional categories of the genes affected by ethanol were metabolite transport and cell wall and membrane biogenesis. It was also observed that some genes were over-expressed in response to ethanol stress (for example, the heat shock protein Hsp 20 and a dipeptidase). Proteomic analysis showed that several proteins are affected by the presence of ethanol. Functions related to protein synthesis and stability are the main target of ethanol damage. In some cases the decrease in protein concentration could be due to the relocation of cytosolic proteins in the membrane, as a protective mechanism. The omic approach used to study the response of [i]O. oeni[/i] to ethanol highlights the importance of the cell membrane in the global stress response and opens the door to future studies on this issue...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOenococcus oeni is {{the best}} adapted {{bacterium}} to the <b>harsh</b> <b>wine</b> medium. Its growth is necessary after the alcoholic fermentation {{for the improvement of}} wine during malolactic fermentation. Inspite of the low pH, ethanol concentration and several other bacterial inhibitors, such as free fatty acids and some phenolic acids, O. oeni actively grow in wine. The efficiency of different starter cultures often used during the winemaking process is related to their inherent ability to survive and multiply. Bacteria use sophisticated mechanisms to enable them to survive a variety of environmental stresses. Among the stress genes whose expression changes in response to various stimuli in Oenococcus oeni several have already been identified. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine genetic markers which should be used for the selection of O. oeni strains. A comparative genomic analysis was carried out between two O. oeni strains with opposite oenological potential. By Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) we checked among 80 O. oeni strains the presence of 46 genomic sequences derived from the comparative genomic analysis. Statistical analysis revealed 11 possible genetics markers. Their expression was quantified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), for 14 efficient O. oeni strains and 5 less adapted. The quantification of transcription levels of the 11 genetics markers after a heat shock, acid and ethanol stress, exponential and stationary phase was determined.

Genomic subtractive hybridization (SH) between two isolates with differing enological potentials was used to elucidate the genetic bases of this intraspecies diversity and identify novel genes involved in adaptation to wine. SH revealed 182 tester-specific fragments corresponding to 126 open reading frames (ORFs). A {{large proportion of the}} chromosome-related ORFs resembled genes involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, and replication, recombination, and repair. Six regions of genomic plasticity were identified, and their analysis suggested that both limited recombination and insertion/deletion events contributed to the vast genomic diversity observed in O. oeni. The association of selected sequences with adaptation to wine was further assessed by screening a large collection of strains using PCR. No sequences were found to be specific to highly performing (HP) strains alone. However, there was a statistically significant positive association between HP strains and the presence of eight gene sequences located on regions 2, 4, and 5. Gene expression patterns were significantly modified in HP strains, following exposure to {{one or more of the}} common stresses in wines. Regions 2 and 5 showed no traces of mobile elements and had normal GC content.

40|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF) is {{a secondary}} wine fermentation conducted by {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB). This fermentation is important in winemaking as it deacidifies the wine, it contributes to microbial stability and lastly it contributes to wine aroma through the production of metabolites. Oenococcus oeni is the main species used in commercially available starter culture currently, but {{research has indicated that}} different Lactobacillus species also partake in MLF and this has shifted the focus in the MLF field to evaluate the potential of lactobacilli as starter cultures for the future. There are 17 different species of Lactobacillus associated with winemaking either being associated with the grapes/beginning of alcoholic fermentation or the MLF and wine. Lactobacillus associated with wine is mainly facultative or obligatory heterofermentative and can withstand the <b>harsh</b> <b>wine</b> conditions such as high ethanol levels, low pH and temperatures and sulphur dioxide. Wine lactobacilli contain the malolactic enzyme encoding gene, but sequence homology shows that it clusters separate from O. oeni. Lactobacillus also possesses more enzyme encoding genes compared to O. oeni, important for the production of wine aroma compounds such as glycosidase, protease, esterase, phenolic acid decarboxylase and citrate lyase. Another characteristic associated with wine lactobacilli is the production of bacteriocins, especially plantaricins which would enable them to combat spoilage LAB.

The VBNC behaviour was monitored by fluorescein diacetate staining/flow cytometry for eleven days after addition of 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1 and 1. 2 mg/L of molecular SO 2 (entrance in the VBNC state) and after SO 2 removal (exit from the VBNC state).

The results reported strongly suggested that the entrance in the SO 2 -induced VBNC state in B. bruxellensis is associated with both, sulfite toxicity and oxidative stress response, confirming the crucial role of genes/proteins involved in redox cell homeostasis. Among the genes induced during recovery, the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and encoding heat shock proteins, as well as enriched categories including amino acid transport and transporter activity was observed.

Although several mechanisms underlying the response to stress have been studied in this species, little is known regarding the cellular systems that protect against oxidative stress in other bacteria, such as glutathione (GSH). O. oeni cannot synthesize GSH but contains several genes related to its utilization. In this study, the relative expression (RE) of the seven genes involved in the GSH redox system found in O. oeni PSU- 1 (gshR, gpo, three glutaredoxin-like genes and two subunits of an hypothetical transporter) has been measured. The study was performed using three strains, with each exhibiting a different GSH uptake capacity. The strains were grown in a stress-adaptation medium supplemented with 5 mM GSH and under different adaptation stress conditions (pH 4 and 6 % ethanol). The RE showed that only some of these genes, including one for a possible glutaredoxin (OEOE_RS 04215) and cydC for a subunit of a putative GSH transporter (OEOE_RS 1995), responded to the addition of GSH. The presence of ethanol had a relevant effect on gene expression. Among the studied genes, the one for a NrdH-redoxin (OEOE_RS 00645) showed a common response to ethanol in the strains, being over-expressed when grown with GSH. In most cases, the transcriptional changes were more evident for the strain with a higher capacity of GSH uptake. Malolactic performance of the three strains after pre-adaptation was evaluated in wine-like media (12 % ethanol and pH 3. 4).

40|$|The {{winemaking}} process {{involves the}} alcoholic fermentation of must, often followed by malolactic fermentation (MLF). The latter, mainly {{carried out by}} the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni, is used to improve wine quality when acidity reduction is required. Moreover, it prevents microbial spoilage and improves the wine's organoleptic profile. Prior observations showed that O. oeni is able to resist several months in <b>harsh</b> <b>wine</b> conditions when adhered on oak barrels. Since biofilm is a prevailing microbial lifestyle in natural environments, the capacity of O. oeni to form biofilms was investigated on winemaking material such as stainless steel and oak chips. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy showed that O. oeni was able to adhere to these surfaces and form spatially organized microcolonies embedded in extracellular substances. To assess the competitive advantage of this mode of life in wine, the properties of biofilm and planktonic cells were compared after inoculation in a fermented must (pH 3. 5 or 3. 2 and 12 % ethanol) The results indicated that the biofilm culture of O. oeni conferred (i) increased tolerance to wine stress, and (ii) functional performance with effective malolactic activities. Relative gene expression focusing on stress genes and genes involved in EPS synthesis was investigated in a mature biofilm and emphasized the role of the matrix in increased biofilm resistance. As oak is commonly used in wine aging, we focused on the O. oeni biofilm on this material and its contribution to the development of wine color and the release of aromatic compounds. Analytical chromatography was used to target the main oak aging compounds such as vanillin, gaiacol, eugenol, whisky-lactones, and furfural. The results reveal that O. oeni biofilm developed on oak can modulate the wood-wine transfer of volatile aromatic compounds during MLF and aging by decreasing furfural, gaiacol, and eugenol in particular. This work showed that O. oeni forms biofilms consisting of stress-tolerant cells capable of efficient MLF under winemaking conditions.

The cellular mechanisms that allow yeast to grow in {{and respond to the}} <b>harsh</b> <b>wine</b> fermentation environment and successfully adapt to changing chemical stresses incurred during fermentation are largely unclear. A genome-wide screening approach utilising collections of yeast mutants with individual known gene deletions, is one paradigm being used to address this gap. Our research has focused on screening approaches collections of yeast with individual gene deletants or gene overexpressers under fermentation conditions, to identify genes that are required for fermentation and which can modulate fermentation outcome. Such genes are representative of what we term the ‘fermentome’. We have previously reported on the identification of 93 genes which lead to fermentation protraction upon deletion, a dataset referred to as the Fermentation Essential Genes (FEG). In this study we report on the construction of an over-expression library in a haploid wine yeast background, which is suitable for fermentation studies in high sugar medium, specifically chemically defined grape juice (CDGJM). This library was screened on a micro-scale (1. 8 mL) with the aim of identifying those genes whose over-expression resulted in enhanced or protracted fermentation performance, and lastly, affected the fermentation profile of 36 known yeast-derived aroma compounds. This presentation will focus on preliminary findings on a subset of overexpression strains which are currently being evaluated for fermentation performance at a laboratory (100 mL) scale. Aroma data will not be discussed. It is envisaged that data collated from this study will expand on the FEG dataset as well as other datasets which together, comprise of the yeast ‘Fermentome’. Through collation of gene datasets relevant to fermentation, we are able to identify and understand which genes (and their products) and cellular processes enable yeast to adapt and grow in grape juice and undergo reliable alcoholic fermentation as in winemaking. We have already constructed a number of gene modifications in haploid wine yeast, with the view of producing robust yeast which exhibit robust fermentation under nitrogen limited or high sugar containing CDGJM under laboratory scale conditions. We are also using the knowledge gained from our research to guide selection strategies in directed evolution approaches to generate new ‘industry ready’ wine yeast with improved fermentation attributes.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of malolactic fermentation (MLF) in most red and some white wines {{is one of}} many factors that determine or influence wine quality, because it affects the flavour and sensory profile of wine. This process is a decarboxylation process conducted by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Oenococcus, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc. Mostly Oenococcus oeni, but recently also Lactobacillus plantarum is used in commercial starter cultures and also the first mixed MLF starter culture (NT 202 Co-Inoculant) was commercialized in 2011. The reason for the predominant use of O. oeni and recently L. plantarum is due to their tolerance to the <b>harsh</b> <b>wine</b> environment. Malolactic fermentation leads to a decrease in acidity and an increase in pH that leaves the wine with a softer mouthfeel. Another reason to conduct MLF is the improvement of microbial stability by the removal of malic acid as carbon source. Research focus has recently shifted to the ability of LAB and MLF as well as the interaction of LAB with yeast to alter the wine aroma profile via the modification and/or production of certain aroma compounds. The main goal {{of this study was to}} assess the impact of yeast and nutrient addition on the ability of the NT 202 Co-Inoculant to conduct MLF during co-inoculation and to evaluate the aroma compound production in the final wine. The first aim was to evaluate the impact of different red and white wine yeast strains on the ability of the NT 202 Co-Inoculant to conduct MLF during co-inoculation in Chardonnay, Merlot and Shiraz. Malolactic fermentation was unsuccessful in the Chardonnay due to a low pH, but successful in Merlot and Shiraz. Based on the malic acid degradation ability of the NT 202 Co- Inoculant, the yeasts were grouped into three categories: inhibitory, neutral or stimulatory towards MLF. Co-inoculated MLF showed a clear decrease in total fermentation time while yeast strains such as WE 372 and Exotics showed positive compatibility with the NT 202 Co- Inoculant. The impact of the yeast-bacterial combinations on the aroma compound production in the final wine was evaluated. Co-inoculated MLF showed positive aroma changes in the red wines with a general increase in total esters (associated with fruity characters in wine) especially ethyl lactate and diethyl succinate that also contribute to the mouthfeel of the wine. Production of esters, volatile fatty acids and higher alcohols seemed to depend on the yeastand LAB strain used. The NT 202 Co-Inoculant contributed to the monoterpenes produced and MLF led to increased concentrations of diacetyl and acetoin, which are associated with buttery characters in wine. The second aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of wine additives (used during coinoculation) such as yeast- and bacterial nutrients, clarifying- and detoxifying agents on the ability of the NT 202 Co-Inoculant to conduct MLF and to assess their impact on the aroma compound production in the final wine. No negative or positive impact on the malic acid degradation of the NT 202 Co-Inoculant or the resulting aroma compound production was observed for the different wine additives used in this study. The results generated from this study showed that the selection of yeast strains is important as it will influence both the fermentation duration and final wine aroma. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die invloed van appelmelksuurgisting (AMG) in die meeste rooi- en witwyne is een van baie faktore wat wynkwaliteit beïnvloed, omrede dit die geur en sensoriese profiel van wyn beïnvloed. Hierdie proses is 'n dekarboksileringsaksie wat deur melksuurbakterieë (MSB), soos Oenococcus, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus en Leuconostoc, uitgevoer word. Die mees algemene bakterieë wat gebruik word, is Oenococcus oeni, maar onlangs het Lactobacillus plantarum ook na vore getree in die gebruik van kommersiële aanvangskulture. Die eerste gemengde AMGaanvangskultuur (NT 202 Co-Inoculant) is in 2011 gekommersialiseer. Die rede vir die oorheersende gebruik van O. oeni en L. plantarum word toegeskryf aan hul gehardhiedsgraad in ‘n uitdagende wynomgewing. Appelmelksuurgisting lei tot 'n afname in die suurheidsgraad en 'n toename in die pH van die wyn, wat 'n sagter mondgevoel tot gevolg het. Nog 'n rede waarom AMG deurgevoer word, is om die mikrobiese stabiliteit van die wyn te verbeter deur die verwydering van appelsuur as koolstofbron. Die navorsingsfokus het onlangs verskuif na die vermoë van MSB en AMG, sowel as die interaksie van MSB met die gis, om die wynaromaprofiel te verander deur middel van die verandering en/of produksie van sekere aromaverbindings. Die hoofdoel van hierdie studie was om die impak van die gis en voedingstof te evalueer ten opsigte van die vermoë van die NT 202 Co-Inoculant om AMG uit te voer tydens koïnokulasie. Die produksie van aromakomponente in die finale wyn is ook geëvalueer. Die eerste doelwit was om die impak van verskillende rooi- en witwyngisrasse te evalueer ten opsigte van die vermoë van die NT 202 Co-Inoculant om AMG uit te voer tydens koïnokulasie in Chardonnay, Merlot en Shiraz. Appelmelksuurgisting was onsuksesvol in die Chardonnay weens 'n lae pH, maar suksesvol in Merlot en Shiraz. In terme van die appelsuurafbraakvermoë van die NT 202 Co-Inoculant, is die giste in drie kategorieë gegroepeer: inhiberend, neutraal of stimulerend teenoor AMG. Ge-koïnokuleerde AMG het 'n duidelike afname in die totale fermentasietyd getoon, terwyl gisrasse, soos WE 372 en Exotics, ‘n positiewe verenigbaarheid met die NT 202 Co-Inoculant getoon het. Die impak van die gisbakteriële kombinasies op die aromakomponentproduksie in die finale wyn is geëvalueer. Gekoïnokuleerde AMG het positiewe aromaveranderinge in die rooiwyne getoon met 'n algemene toename in die totale esters (wat geassosieer word met vrugtige karakters in wyn), veral etiellaktaat en dietielsuksinaat, wat ook bydra tot die mondgevoel van die wyn. Dit het voorgekom dat produksie van esters, vlugtige vetsure en hoër alkohole moontlik afhanklik kan wees van die gis- en bakteriële ras gebruik. Die NT 202 Co-Inoculant het bygedra tot die monoterpene wat geproduseer is en AMG het gelei tot verhoogde konsentrasies van diasetiel en asetoïen, wat geassosieer word met botteragtige karakters in wyn. Die tweede doelwit van hierdie studie was om die impak van wyntoevoegingsmiddels (wat tydens koïnokulasie gebruik word) bv. gis- en bakteriese voedingstowwe, verhelderingsagente, asook detoksifiserende agente, te evalueer ten opsigte van die vermoë van die NT 202 Co- Inoculant om AMG uit te voer en om hul impak op die produksie van die aromakomponente van die finale wyn te ontleed. Geen negatiewe of positiewe effekte is waargeneem vir die verskillende wyntoevoegingsmiddels, wat in hierdie studie gebruik is, in terme van die appelsuurafbraak van die NT 202 Co-Inoculant of die gevolglike produksie van aromakomponente nie. Hierdie studie se resultate toon dat die keuse van die gisras belangrik is, omdat dit die fermentasietydperk, asook die finale wynaroma, beïnvloed.

40|$|Grapes {{hold the}} flavors of the lands where they grow, and when you make wine from them, those flavors of the land come through. Tasting wine from a place you've been can bring you back to that place with aromas and notes {{indicative}} of that place. A bottle of wine changes every day, {{and how it will}} taste depends on the moment you choose to release it from the glass walls. I {{have a vested interest in}} wine, because it is a living thing. I am compelled to make wine because its characteristics are like personality traits. Although some of those characteristics are harsh at times, I appreciate them all. Each trait plays an important role in the balance, the overall personality. Like my own personality flaws, <b>wine's</b> <b>harsh</b> tones can smooth over time. My relationship with wine is constantly evolving, with every new varietal, vintage, batch and blend. Believe me, after some of the jobs I had before my first day at Su Vino, I cherish every moment of my winemaking career. My Whine, Your Wine is the story of how it all started...|$|R
40|$|Variability in gene {{content and}} {{expression}} of the thioredoxin system in Oenococcus oeniDOI: 10. 1016 /j. fm. 2016. 08. 005 Link: [URL] Filiació URV: SI Inclòs a la Memòria: SIThe thioredoxin system protects against oxidative stress through the reversible oxidation of the thioredoxin active center dithiol to a disulphide. The genome of Oenococcus oeni PSU- 1 contains three thioredoxin genes (trxA 1, trxA 2, trxA 3), one thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and one ferredoxin reductase (fdr) which, until recently, was annotated as a second thioredoxin reductase. For the first time, the entire thioredoxin system in several O. oeni strains isolated from wine has been analysed. Comparisons at the DNA and protein levels have been undertaken between sequences from O. oeni and other genera and species, and the genera Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus were found to present the highest similarities. The gene most frequently absent from a collection of 34 strains and the sequences annotated in the NCBI database was trxA 1. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis suggested that this gene was horizontally transferred from Lactobacillus to O. oeni. Strain-dependent expression profiles were determined in rich and in wine-like media. General over-expression was detected after inoculation into wine-like medium, with trxA 3 being the most highly expressed gene. The increased transcriptional levels of the thioredoxin genes are indicative of the crucial role of this system in the O. oeni response to <b>wine</b> <b>harsh</b> conditions...|$|R
