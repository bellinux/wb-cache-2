40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} {{the study of the}} Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modulation scheme. The aspects considered are its operation under non-linear conditions as well as an investigation into the hardware implementation of both coherent and non-coherent MSK modems. The literature on digital data transmission and MSK in particular is surveyed, and a comprehensive theoretical description of MSK is given. In addition, papers on the operation of MSK under non-linear conditions were studied, and their major findings are presented. Due to the lack of theory on the effects of <b>incorrect</b> <b>modulation</b> index on the error performance of MSK, an investigation into this avenue was performed. The design of a correction mechanism for maintaining the modulation index at its correct value is described, and aspects of its implementation are considered. Using the available literature, various modules of which a coherent MSK modem is comprised were developed, and their design is discussed. The design of a non-coherent MSK demodulator is also described...|$|E
40|$|Diffractive optical {{elements}} (DOEs) {{realized by}} spatial light modulators (SLMs) often have features that distinguish them from most conventional, static DOEs: strong coupling between phase and amplitude modulation, a modulation versus steering parameter characteristic {{that may not}} be precisely known (and may vary with, e. g., temperature), and deadspace effects and interpixel cross talk. For an optimal function of the DOE, e. g. as a multiple-beam splitter, the DOE design must account for these artifacts. We present an iterative design method in which the optimal setting of each SLM pixel is carefully chosen by considering the SLM artifacts and the design targets. For instance, the deadspace-interpixel effects are modeled by dividing the pixel to be optimized, and its nearest neighbors, into a number of subareas, each with its unique response and far-field contribution. Besides the customary intensity control, the design targets can also include phase control of the optical field in {{one or more of the}} beams in the beam splitter. We show how this can be used to cancel a strong unwanted zeroth-order beam, which results from using a slightly <b>incorrect</b> <b>modulation</b> characteristic for the SLM, by purposely sending a beam in the same direction but with the opposite phase. All the designs have been implemented on the 256 × 256 central pixels of a reflective liquid crystal on silicon SLM with a selected input polarization state and a direction of transmission axis of the output polarizer such that for the available different pixel settings a phase modulation of &# 8764; 2 &# 960; rad could be obtained, accompanied by an intensity modulation depth as high as > 95 %...|$|E
40|$|Vertebrate kidney {{organogenesis}} is characterised by {{the successive}} {{formation of the}} pronephros, the mesonephros and the metanephros. The pronephros {{is the first to}} form and is the functional embryonic kidney of lower vertebrates; although it is vestigial in higher vertebrates, it is a necessary precursor for the other kidney types. The Xenopus pronephros is a simple paired organ; each nephron consists of a single large glomus, one set of tubules and a single duct. The simple organisation of the pronephros and the amenability of Xenopus laevis embryos to manipulation make the Xenopus pronephros an attractive system in which to study organogenesis. It has been shown that pronephric tubules can be induced to form in presumptive ectodermal tissue by treatment with RA and activin. We have used this system in a subtractive hybridisation screen that resulted in the cloning of Xenopus laevis annexin IV (Xanx- 4). Xanx- 4 transcripts are specifically located to the developing pronephric tubules, and the protein to the luminal surface of these tubules. Temporal expression shows zygotic transcription is upregulated at the time of pronephric tubule specification and persists throughout pronephric development. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of Xanx- 4 suggests it may have a role in pronephric tubule development. Overexpression of Xanx- 4 yields no apparent phenotype, but Xanx- 4 depletion, using morpholinos, produces a shortened, enlarged tubule phenotype. The phenotype observed can be rescued by co-injection of Xanx- 4 mRNA. Although the function of annexins is not yet clear, studies have suggested a role for annexins in a number of cellular processes. Annexin IV has been shown to have an inhibitory role in the regulation of epithelial calcium-activated chloride ion conductance. The enlarged pronephric tubule phenotype observed may be attributed to <b>incorrect</b> <b>modulation</b> of exocytosis, membrane plasticity or ion channels and/or water homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate an in vivo role for annexin IV {{in the development of the}} pronephric tubules in Xenopus laevis...|$|E
30|$|Recently, in 2007, Sung-Joon Park [6] {{presented}} a novel symmetrical structure named as triangular quadrature amplitude modulation (TQAM) in which vertices of the equilateral triangles were taken as constellation signal points. TQAM has a proven efficiency against SQAM {{in terms of}} error probability performance and detection complexity in [6, 7]. TQAM uses even number of bits to represent a signal point in the constellation. The key reason behind the efficiency of TQAM constellation is its compact geometry. In 2010, symbol error probability (SEP) of TQAM was evaluated by K. Cho, J. Lee, and D. Yoon for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel [8] and also, an approximation of SEP expression for TQAM was derived for AWGN and fading channels by T. T. DUY and H. Y. KONG [9], in which maximal-ratio combining (MRC) was used to analyze TQAM over Rayleigh fading channel with multipath reception. In [10], θ-QAM was introduced to incorporate SEP of SQAM and TQAM in a single analytical expression over AWGN and Nakagami-m channels; however, J. Lee et al. [11] proved their work <b>incorrect</b> for higher <b>modulation</b> order and presented their own equations for exact SEP and bit error probability (BEP) over AWGN channel and also paved way for exact BEP over Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami-m channels. However, the SEP expressions provided in [10] are valid only for modulation order 16. In 2012, Sung-Joon Park analyzed the SEP performance of TQAM in AWGN channel using an approximate expression for the SEP [7]. Though an exact generalized mathematical SEP expression {{in the presence of}} AWGN channel is provided in [11], the mathematical model we provide in this article can be implemented easily when dealing with TQAM not only in AWGN, but also this model is extended to Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Nakagami-n, and Nakagami-q channels. To the best of author’s knowledge, generalized SEP expressions for fading channels incorporating diversity reception have not been presented before in [7 – 11].|$|R
