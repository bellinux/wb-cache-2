5000|$|In August 1982, Josh Bazell, then 12 {{years of}} age, {{and his family}} were left adrift at sea in a 14-foot (4.3 metre) {{aluminum}} boat when it ran out of <b>fuel</b> <b>2</b> miles (3.2 kilometres) from Grand Cayman island. Josh's father swam to shore to summon help but on returning, the boat with Margot (the step-mother), Rebecca and Josh aboard, had drifted away and could not be found. The search involved many private vessels, four military aircraft and a Coast Guard cutter. In the afternoon of the fourth day the Japanese tanker Arabia Addas happened upon the boat, which had drifted to a position 40 miles (64 km) from Grand Cayman. The family were re-united that night aboard the tanker. The family were afterwards described as [...] "in absolutely perfect condition - a bit skinny and suntanned".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a global model of climate policy, {{focusing on the}} choice between tax and cap-and-trade solutions. We assume that {{the world can be}} split into two regions, with two fuels that both lead to carbon emissions. Region A consumes all fuels, and is responsible for defining and implementing climate policy. Region B produces all of fuel 1 (oil), while <b>fuel</b> <b>2</b> (interpreted as either coal; natural gas; or renewables) is both produced and consumed in region A. We study three model variants. All involve full policy coordination within each country block, but no coordination across blocks; and all involve an optimal producer tax on fuel 1 by region B. In model 1, region A sets two fuel consumption taxes, one for each fuel. The optimal region A tax on fuel 1 then exceeds the Pigou level as defined by the region; while the tax set on <b>fuel</b> <b>2</b> is Pigouvian. Presence of a second fuel in region A reduces region B’s optimal tax on fuel 1. In model 2, region A sets a common carbon tax, which is lower (higher) for fuel 1 (2) than in model 1. In model 3, region A sets a carbon emissions cap. This enhances region B’s strategic position via the trade-off between fuels 1 and 2 in region A, following from the cap. In realistic cases, this leaves region A strategically weaker under a cap policy than under a tax policy, more so the less carbon-intensive the local <b>fuel</b> (<b>2)</b> is. In conclusion, a fuel-consuming and-importing region that determines a climate policy, will typically prefer to set a carbon tax, instead of setting a carbon emissions cap. The main reason is that a tax is more efficient than a cap at extracting rent from fuel (oil) exporters. ...|$|E

It is important to characterize gas turbine operation using such fuels under controlled conditions before implementing them in flight.

Jet A- 1 - baseline <b>fuel</b> <b>2.</b> 100 % unblended Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) synthetic kerosene fuel with aromatics (SKA) 3. 100 % unblended Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) 4.

Weekly mean C- 14 -based fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> mixing ratios and corresponding regional CO offsets (Delta CO) are proposed to determine weekly mean Delta CO/Delta CO 2 (foss) ratios {{in order to}} derive hourly Delta CO 2 (foss) mixing ratios from hourly Delta CO measurements. Respective regional model estimates of CO and CO 2 (foss) are applied to test this approach and obtain root mean square errors of the correspondingly determined regional hourly fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> component.

The uncertainty of the proposed method turns out to increase with decreasing fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> fraction ranging from about 15 % up to 40 % for continental Europe.
