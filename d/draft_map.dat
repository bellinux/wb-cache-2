A <b>draft</b> <b>map</b> at its website shows the southern boundary expanding one lot down {{the west side of}} South Highland, across Maple Street, to include Highland Cottage, an 1872 reinforced concrete house already listed on the Register. At the northern end, the property at 22–24 Croton Avenue next to the municipal building would be included, and the west end would extend to 55 and 57 Central Avenue and 107–113 Main Street. A formal application for that boundary increase was scheduled for review by the state's Historic Preservation Board, the first step toward eventual approval by the National Park Service (NPS), in March 2012.
