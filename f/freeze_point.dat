40|$|Abstract—The <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> of milk is in {{important}} {{indicator of the}} milk quality. The <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> of milk is determined primarily to prove milk adulteration with water and to {{determine the amount of}} water in it. Chemical composition and properties of milk, thermal treatment and presence of any substance can influence <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> of product. There are different substances, which can be added to milk with main purpose to prolong shelf-life of raw milk. There are detergent, preservatives, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, antibiotics, sodium carbonate, and hydrogen peroxide. Therefore the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> of milk, skimmed milk, pasteurized milk and milk with different substances (formaldehyde, antibiotics, sodium carbonate, hydrogen peroxide, disinfectant, and detergent) in different concentrations.

50|$|JPTS {{stands for}} Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (high thermal stability, high {{altitude}} fuel), and was created specifically as {{fuel for the}} Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. It is officially called Thermally Stable Aviation Turbine Fuel. JPTS has a lower <b>freeze</b> <b>point,</b> higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard Air Force fuels.

The U-2 has used JPTS since the aircraft's development in the 1950s. The high viscosity is needed to overcome the partial solidification of the fuel in low temperatures. The fuel also serves as coolant of engines and aerodynamically heated surfaces. As the fuel flow at U-2 operation altitude at cruising flight is about sixteen times lower than at sea level, the dwell time over hot surfaces is longer and increases the chances of thermal breakdown; high thermal stability is therefore desired to avoid coking and deposition of varnishes in the piping.|$|E
