50|$|In contrast, low-g {{conditions}} can be disastrous for helicopters. In {{such a situation}} their rotors may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause {{the root of the}} blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on Robinson helicopters.This effect was first discovered when many accidents with Bell UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low terrain flight after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb.Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0g, but may encounter this depending on their flapping <b>hinge</b> <b>offset</b> from the mast. However, dangerous situations, as with a teetering rotor, may not occur.|$|E

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{understand}} the whirl flutter phenomenon in flapped blade rotor systems and also to shed some light in bridging the existing gap between theoretical and experimental results, the equations of motion of an idealised mathematical model of a multi-bladed rotor system were formulated. Generalised aerodynamic forces were obtained from quasi-steady blade element theory. These 13; equations were linearised and solved for a symmetric case of the system. The stability boundaries for different hinge offsets of the blades are presented as nacelle frequency parameter for neutral instability against blade flapping frequency parameter. It was found that for a particular value of the flapping frequency parameter, which {{is a function of}} blade <b>hinge</b> <b>offset</b> and restraint spring constant at the flapping hinge, the nacelle frequency parameter required for neutral instability is minimum. From these results it can be shown that an optimum flapping hinge position from the whirl flutter point of view can be determined. Low speed wind tunnel experiments were performed on a simplified model with different <b>hinge</b> <b>offset</b> conditions. Both 10 per cent and 13. 6 per cent hinge offsets resulted in backward whirl flutter as predicted by theory...|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by Grigorian (1993), Grigorian and Grigorian (1988), Taranath (1998) and Bozorgnia and Bertero (2004) that mathematical models of upright, regular rectangular moment frames can be construed as being composed of hypothetical, rigidly jointed, rectangular modules stacked {{on top of each}} other and supported on base level boundary modules. A similar approach has been adopted here to study the efficient design of VG as horizontal moment frames, simply supported at both ends and subjected to a monotonically increasing distribution of normal nodal forces applied along the top and/or bottom chords of the girder. The effects of shear, panel zone, axial load and other secondary phenomena on flexural response of the system have been discarded for the sake of simplicity. Strain hardening and plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>offsets</b> have also been ignored in favor of clarity as well as higher load factors against failure.|$|R
40|$|Future in-space {{construction}} and assembly facilities {{will require the}} use of space cranes capable of supporting and manipulating large and massive loads. The large size of the space components being considered for construction will require that these cranes have a reach on the order of 100 meters. A space crane constructed from an erectable four-longeron truss beam with 19 5 -sq-m truss bays is considered. This concept was selected to be compatible with the Space Station truss. This truss is hinged at three locations along its bottom edge and attached at one end to a rotary joint cantilevered to the assembly depot's main truss structure. The crane's boom sections are rotated by extensible longeron actuators located along the top edge of the beam. To achieve maximum position maneuvering capability for the crane requires that the individual sections be capable of rotating 180 degrees about the hinge point. This can only be accomplished by <b>offsetting</b> the <b>hinges</b> from the longeron axes. Since <b>offset</b> <b>hinges</b> introduce bending moments in the truss members, an analysis of the effect of <b>hinge</b> <b>offsets</b> on the load-carrying capacity of the structure is required.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{and stability of}} a spin stabilized spacecraft with a hinged appendage system are treated analytically and numerically. The hinged system consists of a central hub with masses attached to massless booms of fixed length whose orientation relative to the main part can change. The equations of motion for the hinged system, with viscous damping at both hinge points, are linearized about the nominal equilibrium position where the booms are orthogonal to the nominal spin axis. Analytic stability criteria indicate that hinge damping must be present and that for limiting cases, where the spin axis is an axis of symmetry, certain conditions relating the <b>hinge</b> point <b>offset</b> coordinates to the moment of inertia ratio and end masses must be satisfied.

If all the mass is assumed to be concentrated at a point, we obtain the idealized simple pendulum. Pendulums have {{played an important role in}} the history of dynamics. Galileo identified the pendulum as the first example of synchronous motion, which led to the first successful clock developed by Huygens. This clock incorporated a feedback mechanism that injected energy into the oscillations (the escapement, a mechanism used in timepieces to control movement and to provide periodic energy impulses to a pendulum or balance) to compensate for friction loses. In addition to horology (the science of measuring time), pendulums have important applications in gravimetry (the measurement of the specific gravity) and inertial navigation. Simple Pendulum Consider a simple pendulum of mass m and length L. The equation of motion can be derived from the conservation of angular momentum about the hinge point, O, ¨ IOθ = −mgL sin θ.

The effect of gap at the flap leading edge is modeled for steady and unsteady flows using an overset grid approach. An existing implicit hole cutting code, with suitable modifications to handle gaps, is used for estab-lishing inter-grid connectivity. The CFD results for a TEF airfoil with overhang and gap is validated with experimental results obtained by Hassan, et. al. Good agreement is seen between CFD and experiment. The effect of gap size and compressibility on the steady airloads of a TEF with overhang is also studied. Theoretical analysis based on incompress-ible inviscid thin airfoil theory is described for the overhang problem for unsteady flows.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} anaytical design {{procedure for}} {{the installation of}} simple pendulums on the blades of a helicopter rotor to suppress the root reactions is presented. A frequency response anaysis is conducted of typical rotor blades excited by a harmonic variation of spanwise airload distributions {{as well as a}} concentrated load at the tip.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} family of new beam-column element models {{which are based on}} damage-plasticity and are suitable for the damage assessment and the collapse simulation of structures. First, a new 1 d hysteretic damage model based on damage mechanics is developed that relates any two work-conjugate response variables such as force-displacement, moment-rotation or stress-strain. The strength and stiffness deterioration is described by a damage variable with continuous evolution. The formulation uses a criterion based on the hysteretic energy and the maximum absolute deformation value for the damage initiation with a cumulative probability distribution function for the damage evolution. The damage evolution function is extended to accommodate the sudden strength and stiffness degradation of the force-deformation relation due to brittle fracture. The model shows excellent agreement with the hysteretic response of an extensive set of reinforced concrete, steel, plywood, and masonry specimens. In this context, it is possible to relate the model's damage variable to the Park-Ang damage index so as to benefit from the extensive calibration of the latter against experimental evidence. The 1 d damage model is then extended to the development of beam-column elements based on damage-plasticity. In these models, the non-degrading force-deformation relation in the effective space is described by a linear elastic element in series with two rigid-plastic springs with linear kinematic and isotropic hardening behavior. The first model, the series beam element, assumes that the axial response is linear elastic and uncoupled from the flexural response. The second model, the NMYS column element, uses an axial-flexure interaction surface for the springs to account for the inelastic axial response and capture the effect of a variable axial load on the flexural response. A novel aspect of the beam-column formulation is that the inelastic response is monitored at two locations that are offset from the element ends to account for the spread of inelasticity for hardening response {{and the size of the}} damage zones for softening response. The plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>offsets</b> account for the response coupling between the two element ends. The implementation of the damage-plasticity elements with the return-mapping algorithm ensures excellent convergence characteristics for the state determination. The proposed elements compare favorably in terms of computational efficiency with more sophisticated models with fiber discretization of the cross section while achieving excellent agreement in the response description for homogeneous metallic structural components. The excellent accuracy is also confirmed by the agreement with experimental results from more than 50 steel specimens under monotonic and cyclic loading. The models are able to describe accurately the main characteristics of steel members, including the accumulation of plastic deformations, the cyclic strength hardening in early cycles, the low-cycle fatigue behavior, and the different deterioration rates in primary and follower half cycles. With the plastic axial energy dissipation accounted for in the damage loading function, the damage-plasticity column model captures the effect of a variable axial force on the strength and stiffness deterioration in flexure, the severe deterioration under high axial compression, the nonsymmetric response under a variable axial force, and the very large plastic axial and flexural deformations before column failure. The validation studies point out the dependence of the strength and stiffness deterioration on the section compactness, the element slenderness, the axial force history, and the axial shortening of the columns. A regression analysis is then used to establish guidelines for the damage parameter selection in relation to the geometry and the boundary conditions of the structural member. The proposed damage-plasticity frame elements are deployed in an analysis framework for the large-scale simulation and collapse assessment of structural systems. The capabilities of the modeling approach are demonstrated with thecase study of an 8 -story 3 -bay special moment-resisting steel frame that investigates various aspects of the structural collapse behavior, including the global and local response under strength and stiffness deterioration, the magnitude and distribution of the local damage variables, and the different types of collapse mechanism. The study proposes new local and global damage indices, which are better suited for the collapse assessment of structures than existing engineering demand parameters like the maximum story drift. The incremental dynamic analysis of the 8 -story moment frame under a suite of earthquake ground motions confirms the benefits of the proposed damage indices for the collapse assessment of structures. The study shows that an aftershock as strong as the main shock increases the collapse margin ratio by as much as 30 % and requires more stringent design criteria for protecting the building from collapse that currently specified. The study compares different modeling aspects for the archetype building to assess the benefits of the proposed beam-column elements, such as the ability to account for the member damage, the offset location of the plastic hinges, the inelastic axial response, the axial-flexure interaction, and the sudden strength and stiffness deterioration due to brittle fracture of the structural member. The study concludes that the proposed family of beam-column elements holds great promise for the large scale seismic response simulation of structural systems with strength and stiffness deterioration, because of their computational efficiency and excellent accuracy. Consequently, the proposed models should prove very useful for the damage assessment and the collapse simulation of structures under extreme loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of active control blade feathering in increasing rotor body damping {{and the possibility}} to eliminate ground resonance instabilities were investigated. An analytical model representing rotor flapping and lead-lag degrees of freedom and body pitch, roll, longitudinal and lateral motion is developed. Active control blade feathering is implemented as state variable feedback through a conventional swashplate. The influence of various feedback states, feedback gain, and weighting between the cyclic controls is studied through stability and response analyses. It is shown that blade cyclic inplane motion, roll rate and roll acceleration feedback can add considerable damping to the system and eliminate ground resonance instabilities, which the feedback phase is also a powerful parameter, if chosen properly, it maximizes augmentation of the inherent regressing lag mode damping. It is shown that rotor configuration parameters, like blade root <b>hinge</b> <b>offset,</b> flapping stiffness, and precone considerably influence the control effectiveness.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study {{conducted}} to investigate further a means of choosing primary rotor parameters to reduce the coupling of longitudinal and lateral flapping in hover and in forward flight are presented. The rotor parameters included - flapping <b>hinge</b> <b>offset,</b> flapping hinge restraint, pitch-flap coupling, and blade Lock number - are known to influence the agility, stability, and operational safety of helicopters. Effects of the nonuniform downwash model of White and Blake on the blade flapping motion are examined, and the theoretical calculation is then correlated with experimental test data. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates, which was previously obtained for a hovering rotor, is evaluated in forward flight. The results show that negligible coupling is achieved in forward flight; moreover, there is the additional benefit of a slight reduction in the coupling of the roll rate to coning. It is also indicated that {{the values of the}} rotor parameters chosen according to the decoupling condition are moderate and that the flapping motion is stable with the parameters chosen...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} parametric investigation of whirl flutter are presented for a model consisting of a windmilling propeller-rotor, or proprotor, having blades with offset flapping hinges mounted on a rigid pylon with flexibility in pitch and yaw. The investigation was motivated {{by the need to}} establish a large data base from which to assess the predictability of whirl flutter for a proprotor since some question has been raised as to whether flutter in the forward whirl mode could be predicted with confidence. To provide the necessary data base, the parametric study included variation in the pylon pitch and yaw stiffnesses, flapping <b>hinge</b> <b>offset,</b> and blade kinematic pitch-flap coupling over a large range of advance ratios. Cases of forward whirl flutter and of backward whirl flutter are documented. Measured whirl flutter characteristics were shown to be in good agreement with predictions from two different linear stability analyses which employed simple, two dimensional, quasi-steady aerodynamics for the blade loading.

40|$|The use {{of active}} blade pitch control to {{increase}} helicopter rotor/body damping is studied. Control is introduced through a conventional nonrotating swashplate.

For the rotor/body configuration analyzed, rotor cyclic inplane motion and body roll-rate and roll-acceleration feedback can considerably augment system damping levels and eliminate ground resonance instabilities.

This increase in lead-lag damping can be accomplished without altering any of the system modal frequencies.

The steady state flapping response is examined with respect to control input and aircraft angular rate which leads to a feedforward control law for control decoupling through cross feed, and a feedback control law to decouple the steady state flapping response. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates without using feedback control is also found for the hover case.

For such a helicopter, the fuselage and rotor responses become fully coupled and the quasi-steady assumption using a 6 -DoF rigid-body model state space description and approximating the neglected rotor degrees of freedom by equivalent time delays is not suitable. Depending on the intended use of the model, the accurate mathematical description of the vertical motion for these configurations requires an extended model structure that includes inflow and coning dynamics.

40|$|For many years, {{analysts have}} been {{puzzled by the}} fact that the {{off-axis}} coupling of a helicopter exhibits the opposite sign in flight tests as compared to simulations. Recently, researchers have shown that the effect may be attributable to the bending of the wake during a pitching maneuver, which introduces a fore-to-aft gradient in induced flow that can reverse the predicted sign of the roll coupling. Other research as shown that this result can also be obtained with momentum and vortex theory. There are many issues still under debate regarding the magnitude of wake distortion and its effectiveness in predicting off-axis dynamics. In the present work, a generalized ynamic wake model is augmented to include wake distortions. This model is then coupled with a flap model for simulation in low speed forward flight.
