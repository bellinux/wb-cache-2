5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body.</b> Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

25|$|For {{the same}} reason, Thomson says, {{abortion}} does {{not violate the}} fetus's legitimate right to life, but merely deprives the fetus of somethingthe non-consensual use of the pregnant woman's body and life-support functionsto which it has no right. Thus, by choosing to terminate her pregnancy, Thomson concludes that a pregnant woman does not normally violate the fetus's right to life, but merely withdraws its use of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body,</b> which usually causes the fetus to die.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the name}} might imply it, a queen bee does not {{directly}} control the hive. Her sole function is {{to serve as the}} reproducer. A well-mated and well-fed queen of quality stock can lay about 1,500 eggs per day during the spring build-up—more than <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body</b> weight in eggs every day. She is continuously surrounded by worker bees who meet her every need, giving her food and disposing of her waste. The attendant workers also collect and then distribute queen mandibular pheromone, a pheromone that inhibits the workers from starting queen cells.|$|E

25|$|Fawcett had steadfastly {{resisted}} appearing nude {{in magazines}} throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{even though she}} had briefly appeared topless in the 1980 film Saturn 3. She caused a major stir by posing semi-nude in the December 1995 issue of Playboy. At the age of 50, she appeared in a pictorial for the July 1997 issue of Playboy, which also became a top seller. The issue and its accompanying video featured Fawcett actually using <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body</b> to paint on canvas; for years, this had been one of her ambitions.|$|E
25|$|For many people, {{abortion}} {{is essentially a}} moral issue, concerning the commencement of human personhood, {{the rights of the}} fetus, and a woman's rights over <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body.</b> The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion rights campaigners seeking the repeal or easing of such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.|$|E
25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder. Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that a woman {{has a right to}} make decisions about <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

This paper analyses two possible types of positive justifications for promoting patient self-management: evidence-based and patient-centred justifications.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of this period, there was hope by activists that gains would be made in the area of contraception and a woman's right to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body</b> choices. President Luis Echeverría had convened the Interdisciplinary Group for the Study of Abortion, which included anthropologists, attorneys, clergy (Catholic, Jewish and Protestant), demographers, economists, philosophers, physicians, and psychologists. Their findings, in a report issued in 1976, were that criminality of voluntary abortion should cease and that abortion services {{should be included in the}} government health package. The recommendations were neither published or implemented. In 1980 feminists convinced the Communist Party to table a bill for voluntary motherhood, but it never moved forward. In 1983, a proposal was made to modify the penal code, but strong reaction from conservative factions dissuaded the government from action.|$|E

Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri Brandt had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Michelle Jones had been decapitated and disemboweled, with her heart and organs removed.

At the tower, Rosiel kills Katan, only {{to realize that he}} had killed the one he loved and tried to protect from himself; he then goes into a state of destructive despair. Awakening in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>body</b> with Setsuna's help, Alexiel reveals to him that she had always loved him: because he had been born the opposite of his healthy sister, she bargained with God to save his life in exchange for her imprisonment, from which she later escaped with Lucifer, and an agreement to never show him any compassion. She then kills him, and absorbs him into her womb so that they will never be apart again. Before dying, Rosiel passes along his power to Setsuna.|$|E
