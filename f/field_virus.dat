The purified gI was used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that identified and differentiated field virus-exposed animals from animals vaccinated with gI-deleted virus. The gI ELISA was evaluated by comparing it with the virus neutralization test and with a standard ELISA which does not distinguish between vaccinated and naturally infected animals.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} a potential effect caused by coccidia on the immune response to vaccine- and very virulent infectious bursal disase virus (vvIBDV) in SPF chickens. Methods Two {{groups of three}} weeks old SPF chickens were vaccinated prior to inoculation with coccidia and challenge with virulent IBDV, all within a period of eight days. Two control groups were similarly treated, except that challenge with <b>field</b> <b>virus</b> was omitted in one group while inoculation with coccidia was omitted in the other group. Clinical signs, lesions in the intestines caused by coccidia, lesions in the bursa of Fabricius caused by IBDV, IBDV-antibody titres, and virus detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were compared among the groups. Lymphoid tissues and swab samples were analysed by general RT-PCR, and positive results were identified by strain specific duplex (DPX) RT-PCR. Results In the tripple-infected groups, vaccine strain IBDV was detected in spleen and thymus tissues, and no <b>field</b> <b>virus</b> was detected in bursa samples, contrary to the double-infected groups.

40|$|One month {{prior to}} breeding, sows were vaccinated with an {{attenuated}} pseudorabies virus vaccine or challenged with a field strain of pseudorabies virus. A third group of sows were not vaccinated or challenged before breeding. Pigs from these sows were vaccinated at 3, 6, or 12 weeks {{of age and}} challenged with virulent virus three weeks later. One pig from each litter served as an unvaccinated, unchallenged control. Serum neutralization titers of these pigs were monitored from birth until 22 weeks of age. Titers of the sows were monitored through breeding, gestation and farrowing. The maximum prefarrowing anti-pseudorabies virus titer in the <b>field</b> <b>virus</b> challenged sows occurred four weeks following challenge. A significant decline in titers occurred at farrowing. Titers rose from one week postfarrowing and then declined. Titers in the <b>field</b> <b>virus</b> infected sows were consistently two to threefold greater {{than those of the}} vaccinated sows. The maximum prefarrowing anti-pseudorabies virus titer in the vaccinated sows occurred six weeks following vaccination. The geometric mean titer in these sow's then decreased and increased for two weeks after farrowing. The results in the pigs can be summarized as follows: Pigs from control sows had a greater serological response following <b>field</b> <b>virus</b> challenge than following vaccination with a modified live virus. Pigs from control sows responded serologically to vaccination at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of age. Pigs from control sows which were challenged at 6, 9 and 15 weeks of age had similar antibody responses. Pigs from vaccinated sows had no increase in titer following vaccination at three and six weeks of age. Titers increased when these pigs were vaccinated at 12 weeks of age. There was no significant increase in mean titers of pigs from challenged sows following vaccination at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of age.

40|$|Since the 1980 s {{a number}} of live {{attenuated}} type A and B Avian Pneumovirus (APV) vaccines have been developed in Europe and these have generally afforded good protection. All have been produced by repeated passages of <b>field</b> <b>virus</b> in a laboratory culture system to achieve various degrees of attenuation. They are widely used in commercial growing turkeys and to prime future layers and breeders. When tested under experimental conditions, these empirically derived vaccines were shown to be fully protective whilst not causing detectable disease themselves. However, they have not performed as well when used {{in the field and}} unstable attenuation has been considered to be a possible factor. This paper describes the first evidence of reversion of an APV vaccine in the field. First, systematic evidence of extended vaccine virus persistence in the field arose from longitudinal studies performed in the UK in 1995. Secondly, from an outbreak of Turkey Rhinotracheitis (TRT) in an Italian turkey flock previously vaccinated at day old, we isolated an APV which proved to be a vaccine derivative by sequencing. Finally, in order to determine whether vaccine virus or a derivative of increased virulence had been isolated, the virus was applied to 1 day old poults in secure isolation conditions.

A follow-up was made on titer post-vaccinal antibodies, group of positive results {{and the level of}} degree of damaged cloacal bursa (Fabricius bursa). The best parameters of the tests was that of Fylornis vaccine. Hence it was revealed that 10 days after vaccination in showed 100 % positive results with sufficient high average titer post-vaccination antibodies. In the second experiment a follow-up was made on the persistence of maternal antibodies against IBD virus in broiler chickens hybrid ROSS 308, which were vaccinated with quadric-valent (quadrovalent) inactivated oil emulsion (vac- 4). After vaccination it was observed that chickens still had signs of passive antibodies at almost the same level in the minimum of 4 days after hatchery. After that the titer of maternal antibodies value gradually became low and reached the breach or break-point titer, hence the period for active vaccination of chickens was revealed to be between 17 and 21 days. The third experiment was related to the second one and verified its theory whereby, due to the level of maternal antibodies suitable vaccination time was set to be between 17 and 21 days of age.

The continuous drift of Indonesian HPAI/H 5 N 1 viruses and {{emergence of a new}} clade in 2012 that became dominant in 2016, demands the assessment of commercial vaccine formulations against Indonesian <b>field</b> <b>viruses.</b> Seven databases were explored to identify relevant literature reporting performance of commercial vaccines against Indonesian HPAI/H 5 N 1 viruses. After methodological assessment, data were collated and analyzed to report immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent respiratory and cloacal viral shedding 2 -day post challenge, and death {{at the end of the}} follow-up period. Meta-analyses were performed to assess VE consistency of alternative formulations and to explore sources of heterogeneity in VE. In total, 65 studies and 46 vaccine formulations from 13 articles were grouped per OIE's VE protocols (group 1) and variations of it (groups 2, 3, 4). We found that concurrence of vaccine-seed and challenge-viruses in a clade designation might be a better proxy of VE than current estimates based on vaccine-homologous HI antibody titers, particularly against current fourth order clade viruses (groups 1 & 2). Prime-boosting was efficacious across different chicken breeds (group 3), and early vaccination may increase the risk of death (group 4). One Indonesian vaccine was tested against the new dominant clade, conferring consistent protection in chickens but not in ducks. Meta-analyses revealed high inconsistency (I 2 ≥ 75 %) and inefficacy of LPAI formulations against current <b>field</b> <b>viruses,</b> while potential sources of inconsistent VE were formulation of seed-homologous vaccines and the species vaccinated. We conclude that the VE of commercial vaccines in Indonesia changes as Indonesian HPAI/H 5 N 1 evolve into new clades, which should warrant continuous matching between vaccine-seeds and emerging HPAI/H 5 N 1. Furthermore, given the characteristics of the new Indonesian dominant HPAI/H 5 N 1 clade, further studies to confirm VE across species are warranted. embarg...|$|R

One day old poults were vaccinated with subtype B vaccine in experimental conditions and later challenged with either early (TRT VR 240) or later subtype B (205 - 16 / 04) field isolates. Protection was very poor as assessed by both clinical disease and shedding of virus after 205 challenge. The limited immunity observed may explain {{the dominance of the}} later type subtype B <b>field</b> <b>viruses</b> over a six year period in this Italian region. This may have resulted from immune pressure induced by mass subtype B vaccination...|$|R
