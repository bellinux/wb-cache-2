40|$|ABSTRACT Direct {{injection}} strategies play {{an important}} role in modern Diesel engines and high-pressure common rail injection systems made easier to achieve better <b>engine</b> <b>performances</b> and lower fuel consumption. It is generally recognized that the design of the fuel injection strategy and in particular the performance of the injection system represent the key factor in meeting the increasing demand for <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> and reduced exhaust emissions. The recent introduction of the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion concept, as an attractive alternative for future IC engines, poses an increased demand for better fuel injection strategies and <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> the mixture formation process. The HCCI concept requires early fuel injection in a gas environment at lower pressure and density, compared to the conventional Diesel engines, and thus the injection strategy needs modification to assure sufficient mixing and to match evaporation and ignition requirements, while avoiding fuel impingement on the combustion chamber surfaces. This paper describes spray penetration characteristics of a common-rail piezo-type injector operated at medium-high pressures. Optical diagnostics and CCD camera photography are currently applied to generate an extensive data base which is intended for validation of CFD simulations <b>of</b> HCCI <b>engines.</b> The preliminary results show that a proper selection of the injection strategy together with high injection pressures can fulfil the main requirements <b>of</b> HCCI <b>engine</b> conditions, still avoiding impingement of the spray on the wall.

40|$|Turbofan engines, which {{power the}} {{majority}} of the modern aircraft today, have achieved such a high maturity that small <b>improvements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> requires a large investment. More innovative technologies, including those related to the engine cores, become increasingly attractive due to the high fuel price in recent years as well as the strict regulations on emissions. In this thesis three different innovative core concepts based on alternative cycles are analysed. The first requires introducing an intercooler into a high bypass ratio engine. Intercooling can reduce the high pressure compressor exit temperature and enables a very high overall pressure ratio and thus also high thermal efficiency. The second innovative concept is the intercooled recuperated core. Recuperation can recover energy from the exhausts and improve the engine thermal efficiency. The third innovative concept makes use of a variable core cycle. By adopting a variable core cycle, one can keep the thermal efficiency at a relatively high level during cruise conditions. To analyse and evaluate these concepts, the performance, dimensions and weight of the relevant components have been modelled with empirical correlations, industrial input and with CAD/CFD tools.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The in-cylinder flow of internal combustion (IC) engines, formed during the intake stroke, {{is one of the}} most important factors that affect the quality of air-fuel mixture and combustion. The inducted airflow through the inlet valve is primarily influenced by the intake port design, intake valve design, valve lift and valve timing. Such parameters have a significant influence on the generation and development of in-cylinder flow motion. In most combustion systems the swirl and tumble motions are used to aid the air-fuel mixing with the subsequent decay of these bulk flow motions generating increased turbulence levels which then enhance the combustion processes in terms of rate of chemical reactions and combustion stability. Air motion formed inside the engine cylinder is three-dimensional, transient, highly turbulent and includes a wide spectrum of length and time scales. The significance of in-cylinder flow structures is mainly reflected in large eddy formation and its subsequent break down into turbulence kinetic energy. Analysis of the large scale and flow motions within an internal combustion <b>engine</b> are <b>of</b> significance for the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance.</b> A first approximation of these flow structures can be obtained by steady state analysis of the in-cylinder flow with fixed valve lifts and pressure drops. Substantial advances in both experimental methods and numerical simulations provide useful research tools for better understanding of the effects of rotational air motion on <b>engine</b> <b>performance.</b> This study presents results from experimental and numerical simulations of in-cylinder flow structures under steady state conditions. Although steady state flow problem still includes complex three-dimensional geometries with high turbulence intensities and rotation separation, it is significantly less complex than the transient problem. Therefore, preliminary verifications are usually performed on steady state flow rig. For example, numerical investigation under steady state condition can be considered as a precondition for the feasibility of calculations <b>of</b> real <b>engine</b> cylinder flow. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique is used in the experimental investigations of the in-cylinder flow structures. The experiments have been conducted on an <b>engine</b> head <b>of</b> a pent-roof type (Lotus) for a number of fixed valve lifts and different inlet valve configurations at two pressure drops, 250 mm and 635 mm of H 2 O that correlate with <b>engine</b> speeds <b>of</b> 2500 and 4000 RPM respectively. From the 2 -D in-cylinder flow measurements, a tumbling vortex analysis is carried out for six planes parallel to the cylinder axis. In addition, a swirl flow analysis is carried out for one horizontal plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis at half bore downstream from the cylinder head (44 mm). Numerically, modelling of the in-cylinder flow is proving to be a key part of successful combustion simulation. The numerical simulations require an accurate representation of turbulence and initial conditions. This Thesis deals with numerical investigation of the in-cylinder flow structures under steady state conditions utilizing the finite-volume CFD package, STAR CCM+. Two turbulence models were examined to simulate the turbulent flow structure namely, Realizable k-ε and Reynolds Stress Turbulence Model, RSM. Three densities of generated mesh, which is polyhedral type, are examined. The three-dimensional numerical investigation has been conducted on the same <b>engine</b> head <b>of</b> a pent-roof type (Lotus) for a number of fixed valve lifts and both valves are opened configuration at two pressure drops 250 mm and 635 mm of H 2 O that is equivalent to <b>engine</b> speeds <b>of</b> 2500 and 4000 RPM respectively. The nature and modelling of the flow structure together with discussions on the influence of the pressure drop and valve lift parameters on the flow structures are presented and discussed. The experimental results show the advantage of using the planar technique (PIV) for investigating the complete flow structures developed inside the cylinder. It also highlighted areas where improvements need to be made to enhance the quality of the collected data in the vertical plane measurements.

40|$|Introduction: Tractors are {{considered}} {{as the main}} power generators in mechanized agriculture. Hence, the experts and engineers in tractor manufacturing of the country, are required to focus on developing and designing new features in tractor manufacturing. This must be, of course, paralleled with the economic aspects. Achieving this goal, Iran Tractor Manufactories Co., (ITMCO) has designed and developed tractors equipped with turbochargers. This has been performed on ITM 800 & ITM 485 models, according to world standards. The turbocharger system, with harnessing of lost energy in engine output fumes, compresses the air entering the engine and more air enters the cylinder. This will cause the engine to burn fuel more efficiently and thus produce more power. Materials and Methods: This study {{has been carried out}} on ITM 485 & ITM 800 tractors (with turbocharger system) and ITM 285 & ITM 475 tractors (without turbocharger system) to assure the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>performance</b> and compare them employing OECD world standards. Experiments were performed in the concrete runway of Tabriz Tractor Manufacturing Company. For experiments, a dynamometer was used to measure the traction force between two tractors, a measuring unit for fuel, a thermometer unit and a timer to measure the quantities of fuel consumption, drawbar force and power. For drawbar traction test, each of the tested tractors pulled the rear tractor in different gears and the dynamometer between these 2 tractors recorded the tractors traction force by data loggers. To measure tractors fuel consumption, a measuring unit of fuel (VDO - EDM 1404) was used that calculated the flow rate in the path of fuel from the fuel tank to the engine and the return path from the engine to the fuel tank and showed the quantity of fuel consumption in liters per hour digitally. Results and Discussion: In comparison of traction power and force of tractors with turbochargers and without turbochargers in different gears, the results of variance analysis showed that the effect of tractor was significant. Traction power and force at tractors with turbochargers ITM 485 and ITM 800 and without turbocharger ITM 475 have {{a significant difference in the}} level of one percent. Tukey post hoc test results also indicate that traction power and force in tractors with turbochargers ITM 485 and ITM 800 are significantly more than the tractor without turbocharger ITM 475. The gear effect is also significant. Traction power and force in different gears have significant difference at the probability of one percent. Tukey post hoc test results indicate that power quantity is highest in the gears: (1 +H, 2 *H, 1 *H, 3 +L) and minimum in the gears: (1 *L, 1 +L, 2 *L), (* Turtle and + Rabbit). But Tukey post hoc test results indicate that traction force quantity is highest in the gears: (1 *L, 2 *L, 1 +L) and minimum in the gears: (2 *H, 1 +H). In the comparison of specific fuel consumption of tractors with turbochargers and without turbochargers in different gears, the results of variance analysis showed that the effect of tractor was significant. The amount of specific fuel consumption at tractors with turbochargers ITM 485 and ITM 800 and without turbocharger ITM 475 has a significant difference in the level of one percent. Tukey post hoc test results also indicate that specific fuel consumption quantity in tractors with turbochargers ITM 485 and ITM 800 in the level of one percent is significantly less than the tractor without turbocharger ITM 475. The gear effect is also significant. The specific fuel consumption quantity in different gears has significant difference at the probability of one percent. Tukey post hoc test results indicate that specific fuel consumption quantity is highest in the gears: (1 *L, 1 +L, 2 *L) and minimum in the gears: (1 +H, 2 *H, 1 *H). Conclusions: The tests were performed on tractor drawbar traction. Results of variance analysis in this experiment on a concrete surface, indicated that the calculated traction power and force of ITM 485 and ITM 800 tractors (with turbocharger system) were higher than the ITM 475 & ITM 285 tractors (without turbocharger) and this difference was significant at the one percent level of probability. Meanwhile specific fuel consumption in the ITM 485 and ITM 800 tractors (with turbocharger system) was lower than that of the ITM 475 & ITM 285 tractors (without turbocharger) and this difference was significant at the one percent level of probability.
