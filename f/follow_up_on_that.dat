40|$|Introduction: The {{topic of}} this special issue is Integrated Sustainability Assessment (ISA) and its {{potential}} role in achieving sustainability-oriented governance and more sustainable development. This is a topic that has featured before in the International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development. Two of the Guest Editors for this special issue, Paul M. Weaver and Jan Rotmans, wrote a paper introducing ISA and its development {{in the context of}} the EC-funded Methods and Tools for Integrated Sustainability Assessment (MATISSE) project, which was published in the journal in 2006. The Weaver–Rotmans paper was written at the outset of the MATISSE project when ISA was at an early stage of conceptual development and its potential was still to be developed and tested. The tool and model development activities of the MATISSE project and its illustrative case studies were then only just at their start. It is now timely and appropriate, therefore, as the MATISSE project nears its completion, that we <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> earlier paper, reporting what progress has been made and making available the latest project developments and emerging findings about ISA. This special issue provides a far broader and much deeper treatment of issues that the earlier paper could only touch on briefly...|$|E

40|$|The Neptune Trojans are {{the most}} recent {{addition}} to the panoply of Solar system small body populations. The orbit of the first discovered member, 2001 QR$_{ 322 }$, was investigated shortly after its discovery, based on early observations of the object, and it {{was found to be}} dynamically stable on timescales comparable to the age of the Solar system. As further observations were obtained of the object over the following years, the best-fit solution for its orbit changed. We therefore carried out a new study of 2001 QR$_{ 322 }$'s orbit in 2010, finding that it lay on the boundary between dynamically stable and unstable regions in Neptune's Trojan cloud, and concluding that further observations were needed to determine the true stability of the object's orbit. Here we <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> earlier work, and present the preliminary results of a dynamical study using an updated fit to 2001 QR$_{ 322 }$'s orbit. Despite the improved precision with which the orbit of 2001 QR$_{ 322 }$ is known, we find that the best-fit solution remains balanced on a knife-edge, lying between the same regions of stability and instability noted in our earlier work. In the future, we intend to carry out new observations that should hopefully refine the orbit to an extent that its true nature can finally be disentangled.
