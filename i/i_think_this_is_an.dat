On 25 February, ANAK-PAWIS Party-list Representative Crispín Beltrán was served a warrant for arrest and taken in for questioning under state of emergency laws for his alleged role in a 1985 coup against Ferdinand Marcos.

They are understandably worried about their next step as musicians: How are they going to enter the industry? How are they going to make a living? And because of that, that can trickle down. The nice thing at Oberlin is that they are immensely talented, but they're not really concerned about their future. They might be a little bit, but it's not what occupies their thoughts. They are thinking about music as an art form. They're preoccupied with how they're going to change the artistic culture. And I think that's actually very important." ...|$|E

[...] Michael Logan of TV Guide wrote in October 2008 that {{although he did not}} enjoy the premiere episode of season two, [...] "then the show got good. Really good." [...] He ranked the spin-off above General Hospital itself, saying [...] "it's indisputably superior to the mob-infested soap that spawned it." [...] Logan added that [...] "This late-night SOAPnet series is refreshingly retro, focusing as GH once did on the lives of doctors and their patients. (Imagine that!) The pleasures are many, from the frisky interplay of interns Claire and Kyle (she's straight, he's not) to the profoundly moving performances of Finola Hughes and Tristan Rogers as Anna and her cancer-stricken Robert." [...] Michael Fairman called Rogers' performance [...] "poignant" [...] and noted that [...] "if it could have been in Emmy contention this year, it would stand among the best." [...] Rogers himself said of the season, [...] "Night Shift was a wonderful glimpse of what was possible to do with a daytime format and a primetime format, shot in HD, edited like a movie, and essentially brought up to date, which was subtle. It was written by Sri Rao, who really understood the genre. He really got it ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> issue of what goes on with the daytime soaps. There are not too many people out there now who want to take what history there is, and take it and build on it. I can see why they don’t want to do that, but on the other hand, I don’t think there is much point in changing history for the sake of change. If you have a really good reason to change it then do it, otherwise use it!" [...] De Lacroix wrote that Season Two [...] "expertly delivered traditional soap opera in a modern form while reinforcing love as the center of the medium, instead of devaluing it as so many soaps do today," [...] adding that [...] "All the characters on NS2 were intelligent adults, {{the way they used to}} be on soap operas before about a decade ago when most characters were rendered brainless and stupid." ...|$|E

40|$|I {{believe that}} the field of {{developmental}} psycholinguistics suffers from two major weaknesses. The first is its impressionistic and inexact formulations. The second is its divisive polarizations. One can see {{the reasons for the}} first weakness. Developmental psycholinguistics is only about 30 years old (ignoring diary studies which preceded the linguistic and cognitive surge of the sixties). But speculation and hypothesizing on the basis of relatively little data and passing acquaintance with phenomena has reached the level of customary ‘business as usual’. We are skilful at hypothesis construction, yet we are regretfully delinquent at formulating clear tests of our hypotheses. We are fond of conjecture about causal relationships, but our empirical tests progress no further than weak forms of correlation. With regard to our second major weakness, our knack for polarizing opinion regarding chimerical questions such as the innateness of language can also be understood. After all, are we not following the classical dialectic model of thesis, antithesis and eventual synthesis? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> idealize...|$|E
40|$|Cuprates: {{experiment}} vs. quasiparticle theory Indeed, one {{can hardly}} disagree {{with most of}} the points raised by P. W.

Experimentally, the ’notorious ”linear T ” resistivity ’ etc. has only been observed at temperatures T of the order of a few degrees Kelvin at most, and never {{all the way down to}} (practically) zero temperature. Somehow, many people in the field make the implicit extrapolation of the linear regime down to T= 0. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important issue, which has been all too often sidestepped, especially in efforts to model the (normal state of the) cuprates.

Aristotle (McKeon 1992 : 329) It is sometimes said, either irritably or with a certain satisfaction, that philosophy makes no progress. It is certainly true, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> abiding and not regrettable characteristic of the discipline, that philoso-phy has in a sense to keep trying to return to the beginning: a thing which is not at all easy to do. Iris Murdoch (1970 : 1) IF ANTHROPOLOGY is to contribute anything distinctly its own to a discussion of causality, the contribution will best come through its specialization in culture. An anthropologist would not be your first choice for statistical ad-vice on the applicability of discrete- or continuous-time models in an event-history analysis. Even in the most elementary quantitative applications, an-thropological texts defer to the work of more expertly trained others (Thomas 1976; Bernard 1988). Fortunately, demographers want anthropological in-sights in precisely those areas of cultural meaning about which they as-sume anthropologists are most prepared to speak. The general understand-ing, mostly unstated, is that anthropologists have a set of procedures and understandings that enable them to make interpretations of the meanings of variables with a degree of reliability that untrained others lack.
