The design {{of the study was}} a Type 3 holistic design which considered the global nature of multiple cases, and focused on the impact of work, family, school, peers and siblings on subjects ’ aspirations. Six case studies were conducted using observations, focus groups, taped interviews and <b>document</b> <b>inspection</b> techniques. Data were analyzed using McCraken’s coding techniques. The results showed that the youths ’ aspirations were leveled, reflected realities of their employment possibilities, and were patterned after their father’s occupations. The youths ’ reluctance to raise their aspirations signals the need for Jamaican policy makers to address the problems caused by low aspirations among youths.

40|$|Software Process Assessment (SPA) was {{conducted}} prior to Software Process Improvement (SPI) activities {{to identify the}} process areas to be improved. The process assessment methods such as ISO/IEC 15504 - 2 and SCAMPI were available to all enterprises.

40|$|Passports, ID cards, banknotes, and degrees are consid-ered as {{valuable}} documents {{that need to}} be secured against forgery. Apart from those, there are many other document types that are valuable, too, but that do not have any se-curity features, as e. g. bills and vouchers. These may be used by fraudulent people to defraud money from e. g. a car insurance company. The wide availability of scanning and printing hardware allows even non-experts to easily forge a document. We therefore present a new aspect in the exam-ination of intrinsic document features for optical document security: the goal is to automatically detect text-lines that have been manipulated or additionally inserted in a doc-ument by inspecting their alignment (left, right or center) with respect to the other text-lines in the document. This constitutes an additional feature in the goal of developing a powerful toolbox for automatic <b>document</b> <b>inspection.</b> Us-ing the extracted text-lines, the alignment margins are ex-tracted. Statistics on the distances of the text-lines to the alignment margins are used to identify lines that might have been forged.

30|$|The {{second step}} in {{document}} forensics is document forgery detection. A forgery could involve changing, adding, or deleting some {{information on the}} document or replacing an entire page with a counterfeited page [9]. For pasting and reprinting forgery operations, character location distortion is often introduced. Beusekon et al. [10] presented a technique for extracting text lines and alignment lines for <b>document</b> <b>inspection.</b> For English language characters, most characters align according to the ascender line, descender line, and base line. Tampered characters deviate from these three lines because of location distortion. In [11], the matching quality between all pairs of documents was used to expose tampered documents. When a page is replaced or reprinted, location distortion will occur when comparing the forged page or the tampered region with a genuine document. By computing the matching quality of two page images, the forged page or tampered region will be detected. Farid and Kee [12] established a printer model for characters to detect documents forged by different printers. They used principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to model the degradation of a page caused by printing, and the resulting printer profile was then used to distinguish between characters generated from different printers.|$|E
40|$|Timely and {{effective}} inspections are a necessary component for ensuring an aircraft’s structural integrity. Since {{its inception in}} 1989, a major thrust of the FAA’s National Aging Aircraft Research Program (NAARP) {{has been in the}} area of nondestructive inspection (NDI) with an initial focus on ensuring the reliable detection of cracks in large transport fuselage lap joints. Over the years, the program has evolved and matured and now encompasses almost all inspection related challenges needed to maintain the continued airworthiness of the entire commercial fleet.

Using these new or improved methods will reduce the number of inspection preventable failures and the associated loss of life and revenue that may accompany these failures. To accomplish this goal, the FAA’s Inspections Systems Research initiative is conducted largely at two major centers established to specifically support the inspection needs of the NAARP. The first, the Center for Systems Reliability (CASR), was established in 1990 at Iowa State University to develop new and innovative inspection methods to solve the uniqu...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{scientists}} and companies {{working in the}} domains of biomedicine and genomics are increasingly faced {{with the problem of}} efficiently locating, within the vast body of published scientific findings, the critical pieces of information that are needed to direct current and future research investment. RESULTS: In this report we describe approaches taken within the scope of the second BioCreative competition in order to solve two aspects of this problem: detection of novel protein interactions reported in scientific articles, and detection of the experimental method that was used to confirm the interaction. Our approach to the former problem is based on a high-recall protein annotation step, followed by two strict disambiguation steps. The remaining proteins are then combined according to a number of lexico-syntactic filters, which deliver high-precision results while maintaining reasonable recall. The detection of the experimental methods is tackled by a pattern matching approach, which has delivered the best results in the official BioCreative evaluation. CONCLUSION: Although the results of BioCreative clearly show that no tool is sufficiently reliable for fully automated annotations, a few of the proposed approaches (including our own) already perform at a competitive level. This makes them interesting either as standalone tools for preliminary <b>document</b> <b>inspection,</b> or as modules within an environment aimed at supporting the process of curation of biomedical literature...|$|E

40|$|Enterprise Architecture is a {{relatively}} young architectural discipline that merges strategic business goals and information technology objectives. It {{is considered to be}} a promising instrument to provide management with insight and overview to drive portfolio planning in a holistic context. Despite its promises, architects discern a reluctance by decision-makers to include and use architectural products in their business processes. This master thesis examined underlying causes for that lack of interest by performing a case study in the Norwegian Defense. Interviews, augmented by observation and <b>document</b> <b>inspection</b> were used to collect data. The data analysis revealed lack of understanding to be a principal issue. Innate complexity and alienation caused by unfamiliar terms were pointed out as essential sources. Additionally, this master thesis studied how Information Visualization potentially could increase the attractiveness of architectural products. A thorough literature review was conducted to discover techniques on how to represent complex information, and to identify best practices on how to present such information in novel and inspiring ways. Findings indicate that a conscious application of methods and techniques from Information Visualization can have a positive impact on presentation of complex architectural information. Guiding principles are pointed out to be clarification, customization and standardization. However, this will require some adjustments in the architects’ skillset. Among others, basic knowledge to decide on appropriate encoding and how to do storytelling with visualization. Further research could be used to verify these indications, by comparing attractiveness of architectural products before and after an implementation of methods and techniques put forward in this study...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{potential}} of visible and near-infrared spectral imaging as a technique of <b>document</b> <b>inspection</b> was examined. Doubtful documents are often found in economic cases, distinguished between original and added strokes and detected blurry characters are very useful for judgment. Burned, covered and rinsed documents in which the characters can’t be identified with naked eyes were experimentally studied with a visible spectral imaging technique. Meanwhile, the same color inks were detected by both visible and near-infrared imaging spectrometers. Classification of spectral images {{was carried out in}} specialist spectral imaging software packager Misystem provided by Institute of Forensic Science. The technique significantly improved the detection of many documents, especially those that might be considered of poor quality or borderline characters. The visible spectral imaging was successful in detecting the burnt Chinese characters produced using pencils. It was possible to form spectral images showing the strokes even covered by Chinese ink by means of imaging at characteristic frequencies. As inks have very different spectral from the clothes, contribution and contrast of the rinsed lines and illegible seal words on clothes were clearly enhanced. By examining the spectral images from the inks, it was possible to determine whether the same color inks were written by the different pens. The results also show that the near-infrared spectrometer is better than visible one in distinguishing the same inks. In blind testing, spectral imaging was shown to achieve an average 85. 1 % chance of success. The results reveal the wide applications of spectral imaging in document evidence analysis. The potential of this technique in forensic science will be more apparent along with the further and deeper studies...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} twenty-five years {{software}} inspections have been considered an effective method for defect detection. Inspections have been investigated through controlled experiments in university environment and industry case studies. However, in most cases software inspections {{have been used for}} defect detection in documents of conventional structured development process. Therefore, there is a significant lack of information about how inspections should be applied to Object-Oriented artifacts, such as Object-Oriented code and design diagrams. In addition, extensive work is needed to determine whether some inspection techniques can be more beneficial than others. Most inspection experiments include inspection meetings after individual inspection is completed. However, several researchers suggested that inspection meetings may not be necessary since an insignificant number of new defects are found as a result of inspection meeting. Moreover, inspection meetings have been found to suffer from process loss. This paper presents the findings of a controlled experiment that was conducted to investigate the performance of individual inspectors as well as 3 -person teams in Object-Oriented design <b>document</b> <b>inspection.</b> Documents were written using the notation of Unified Modelling Language. Two reading techniques, namely Checklist-based reading (CBR) and Perspective-based reading (PBR), were used during experiment. We found that both techniques are similar with respect to defect detection effectiveness during individual inspection as well as during inspection meetings. Investigating the usefulness of inspection meetings, we found out that the teams that used CBR technique exhibited significantly smaller meeting gains (number of new defect first found during team meeting) than meeting losses (number of defects first identified by an individual but never included into defect list by a team); meanwhile the meeting gains were similar to meeting losses of the teams that used PBR technique. Consequently, CBR 3 -person team meetings turned out to be less beneficial than PBR 3 -person team meetings...|$|E

40|$|In {{the attempt}} to bring complex {{patterns}} {{of social and economic}} interaction under effective public control, Congress has relied increasingly on federal regulatory agencies. These agencies can fulfill their statutory missions only if they possess adequate information to determine both when exercise of their substantive powers would be appropriate and what form that exercise should assume. Without knowledge of the actual conditions prevalent in the areas committed to their supervision, agencies can act only capriciously. Of necessity, much of the data needed by regulatory agencies must be obtained from the regulated individuals or companies themselves. Although such information often is supplied voluntarily, difficult legal problems arise when the regulated entity refuses to divulge the requested data. These situations entail collision of important interests: the private entity 2 ̆ 7 s proprietary rights in the data conflict with the public 2 ̆ 7 s interest in effective regulation. This Note examines a major aspect of this conflict: the constitutional and statutory limits on the demands of federal regulatory agencies to inspect documents held by private entities. <b>Document</b> <b>inspection</b> disputes typically arise in the following fashion. An agency representative tenders, by mail or in person, an informal request to be allowed to examine and copy documents held by the private entity. Sometimes the request identifies the documents sought by type, date, or subject matter; not infrequently the request is for plenary access to all files maintained by the entity. Should its informal demand be refused, the agency issues an administrative subpoena for the material. The matter may reach the courts in either of two ways. The person on whom the subpoena is served may challenge its validity in federal court. Alternatively, the agency itself may sue for a court order directing compliance. Regardless of how the suit reaches the courts, the validity of the administrative subpoena will be evaluated by a single standard. The universal rule in the federal courts is that agency access demands will be enforced if the documents sought are reasonably related to an investigation that is within the agency 2 ̆ 7 s authority. Section I of this Note traces the history of judicial treatment of agency access demands, emphasizing the evolution of the reasonable relation standard. Section II critiques the manner in which that standard has been employed, arguing both that it has undermined important constitutional principles and that it has proven incapable of rational application. Finally, Section III proposes a different approach, which, through more careful elaboration of the relevant criteria, better reconciles the competing sets of principles in document access disputes...|$|E
