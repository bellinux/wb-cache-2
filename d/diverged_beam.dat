30|$|Recently, a {{thermionic}} filament-based miniature X-ray {{tube with}} {{the diameter of}} 2.25 mm and the dose rate of a 15 Gy/min (at 1 cm water depth) is commercialized for an X-ray source of electric brachytherapy [13, 14]. However, total operating time has been not guaranteed higher than 2.5 h. In such a thermionic filament-based X-ray tube, high temperature operation of the filament is necessary to increase X-ray dose rate, reducing the lifetime of the filament especially in non-high vacuum environment. CNT field emitters, particularly of a sharp tip shape, {{have been developed for}} high-resolution electron and X-ray devices [6, 7, 16 – 18]. CNT tip emitters can provide high-brightness electron beams due to their point-like electron emission sites. However, a sharp tip emitter has limited number of CNTs and thus each CNT must supply high electron emission current for the application to a high-power X-ray tube. As a result, CNTs can be easily damaged by high joule heating as well as ion particle adsorption [19]. In addition, an electron beam that is produced from a sharp tip is diverged because the electric field generated near the sharp exerts outward forces on the electrons generated from the tip. This <b>diverged</b> <b>beam</b> might be lost during the transport to an X-ray target in a miniature X-ray tube, which prevents the stable operation of the X-ray tube. One of the methods to overcome these properties of CNT tip emitters is to use a flat-tip CNTs, in which many CNTs are attached on a comparatively large area of flat metal substrate. In comparison with a sharp tip emitters, a flat-tip CNT emitter reduces the electrical power loading per each CNT and can provide more parallel electron beam.|$|E

40|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based {{cantilever}} beams {{have been}} widely used in various sensing applications. Most of the studies concerning these micro/nano resonators are centred around uniform cantilever beams. In this thesis, another class of micro-resonators consisting of non-uniform cantilever beams is investigated. Two classes of beams, one with increasing cross sectional area from the clamped edge (<b>diverging</b> <b>beam)</b> and other with decreasing cross sectional area from the clamped edge (converging beam) are studied. Within each class, beams with linear as well as quartic variation in width are investigated. Firstly, the Euler beam equation for non-uniform cantilever beams considering large deflection and their corresponding exact mode shapes from the linear equation are obtained. Subsequently, using the Galerkin method based on single mode approximation, static and dynamic modal equations for finding pull-in voltage and resonance frequency as a function of DC voltage, respectively are obtained. The research in this thesis is focused around investigating different characteristics including the pull-in voltage, resonance frequency at zero and finite DC voltage, mass sensitivity, size effects, etc. of non-uniform cantilever beams. The analysis is presented when these micro beams operate in the linear regime about different static equilibriums. In this thesis, we term this frequency as `linear frequency'. Calculation of the linear frequency is done at different static equilibriums corresponding to different DC voltages. It is found that linear frequency of converging beams increases with increase in non-uniform parameter (α) while those of <b>diverging</b> <b>beams</b> decreases with α. A similar trend is observed for pull-in voltage. Within the converging class, beams with quartic variation in width show significant increase in both frequency and pull-in voltage as compared to corresponding linearly tapered beams...|$|R
40|$|High {{intensity}} laser driven proton beams are {{at present}} receiving much attention. The {{reasons for this}} are many but {{high on the list}} is the potential to produce compact accelerators.

A number of different approaches have been attempted to monochromise these beams but it has become obvious that magnetic spectrometer technology developed over many years by nuclear physicists to transport and focus proton beams could play an important role for this purpose.

Numerical simulations show that the Kerr nonlinearities allow some third-harmonic to propagate to the far-field even for zero or negative phase-mismatch. This is because the nonlinear dynamics break the beams' reflection symmetry about the focal plane and therefore increases far-field THG by changing some of the interference from destructive to constructive. THG conversion efficiencies are computed as functions of several beam parameters. Comment: About 6 pages. 7 Figures. Accepted to Physical Review...|$|R

However this distinction becomes blurred for strongly focused or <b>diverging</b> <b>beams,</b> and in the general case only the total angular momentum of a light field can be defined.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the use of}} cyclic weak measurements to improve the sensitivity of weak-value amplification precision measurement schemes. Previous weak-value experiments have used {{only a small fraction}} of events, while discarding the rest through the process of "post-selection". We extend this idea by considering recycling of events which are typically unused in a weak measurement. Here we treat a sequence of polarized laser pulses effectively trapped inside an interferometer using a Pockels cell and polarization optics. In principle, all photons can be post-selected, which will improve the measurement sensitivity. We first provide a qualitative argument for the expected improvements from recycling photons, followed by the exact result for the recycling of collimated beam pulses, and numerical calculations for <b>diverging</b> <b>beams.</b> We show that beam degradation effects can be mitigated via profile flipping or Zeno reshaping.

40|$|A neutron optical {{transport}} system is proposed which comprises nested short elliptical mirrors located halfway between two common focal points M and M'. It images cold neutrons from a <b>diverging</b> <b>beam</b> or a source with finite size at M by single reflections onto {{a spot of}} similar size at M'. Direct view onto the neutron source is blocked by a central absorber with little impact on the transported solid angle. Geometric neutron losses due to source size can be kept small using modern supermirrors and distances M-M' of a few tens of metres. Very short flat mirrors {{can be used in}} practical implementations. Transport with a minimum of reflections remedies losses due to multiple reflections that are common in long elliptical neutron guides. Moreover, well-defined reflection angles lead to new possibilities for enhancing the spectral quality of primary beams, such as clear-cut discrimination of short neutron wavelengths or beam monochromation using bandpass supermirrors. Multi-mirror imaging systems may thus complement or even replace ordinary neutron guides, in particular at the European Spallation Source. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
