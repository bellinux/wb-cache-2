5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} <b>indexing</b> the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of <b>indexing</b> is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. <b>Indexing</b> is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set <b>indexing</b> rows, and every element in the set <b>indexing</b> columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such <b>indexing</b> gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
