40|$|The {{effects of}} the SAP on the {{agricultural}} sector {{were found to be}} generally positive, especially the incentives to export agriculture, which benefited directly from the exchange rate devaluation. For some of the food crops the price effects were moderated by lack of infrastructure necessary to expand production. Trade policies resulted in relative isolation of foodcrops from the world markets and, while protecting them from external competition, prevented the beneficial devaluation effects to be passed on to these crops. Despite the fact that several methodological approaches were used in the evaluation, the results can only be considered as indicative due to the dearth of "post-SAP" data. It is difficult, for instance, to give a definitive answer as to the policy response of tree crops and livestock to the programme, given the short time period between the programme's implementation and its evaluation, and the long time it takes for such sectors to fully adjust. Appropriate surveys did not exist in the rural areas, and conducting such surveys was beyond the scope of the project. The extraction of definite conclusions regarding the social dimensions of the policy reforms was, therefore, inhibited. Thus, our conclusions on the social {{effects of the}} programme is based on either aggregated data or data covering only very small areas in the country. The decline of the agricultural sector was, to a certain extent, "natural", i. e. it would have happened even in the presence of "proper policies" {{in the presence of a}} booming oil sector. The study used a number of relatively simple empirical procedures to disentangle policy from non-policy effects. It is important that such methodological devices be transmitted to the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture through training so constant programme monitoring and evaluation can be carried out. Serious problems were faced in evaluating the programme due to the highly divergent sources of data. The establishment of a system for consolidation and computerization of agricultural data is long overdue. Although successful results in the agricultural sector are largely determined by macroeconomic policies, there is room for agricultural policy to improve agricultural performance and well-being in rural areas. Fertilizer subsidies remain an important (and thorny) issue. Despite the Government's own declarations about the (non) functionality of the present system, not much has been done to drastically change it. Implementing a plan to enhance the participation of the private sector in the fertilizer distribution system and reducing the level of the subsidy will be a daunting but worthwhile challenge. The importance of rehabilitation of the <b>feeder</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> cannot be overemphasized. Deteriorating rural feeder roads constitute a major impediment to market integration and extenuate interregional price variability. The system of bans on food imports was found to be defective, to expose producers to high price variability and to prevent imports and exports even when domestic prices are very high (low). A move to a system of tariffs will potentially have many advantages, including collection of tariff revenues...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} the discrete decision of a household on whether to participate in banana markets using the FIML bivariate probit method. The continuous decision on how much to sell or buy is analyzed by establishing the supply and demand functions while accounting for the selectivity bias. Results indicate that buying and selling decisions are not statistically independent and the random disturbances in the buying and selling decisions are affected in opposite directions by random shocks. Transaction cost related factors such as geographical location of households, market information sources and travel time to the nearest urban centre do influence participation. Other factors such as labour availability, farming experience, gender of household head, off-farm income and the asset base of the household also affect the likelihood and intensity of participation. Policies guiding central and local governments towards increased investment in rural infrastructure (i. e. <b>feeder</b> <b>roads</b> <b>networks,</b> trunk <b>roads,</b> telecommunication services and establishment of market places) can help reduce transaction costs and thereby improve participation of smallholder farmers in markets.

40|$|What are {{the main}} {{determinants}} of transport costs: network access or competition among transport providers? The focus in the transport sector has often been on improving the coverage of"hard"infrastructure, whereas in reality the cost of transporting goods is quite sensitive {{to the extent of}} competition among transport providers and scale economies in the freight transport industry, creating monopolistic behavior and circular causation between lower transport costs and greater trade and traffic. This paper contributes to the discussion on transport costs in Malawi, providing fresh empirical evidence based on a specially commissioned survey of transport providers and spatial analysis of the country’s infrastructure network. The main finding is that both infrastructure quality and market structure of the trucking industry are important contributors to regional differences in transport costs. The quality of the trunk <b>road</b> <b>network</b> is not a major constraint but differences in the quality of <b>feeder</b> <b>roads</b> connecting villages to the main <b>road</b> <b>network</b> have significant bearing on transport costs. And costs due to poor <b>feeder</b> <b>roads</b> are exacerbated by low volumes of trade between rural locations and market centers. With empty backhauls and journeys covering small distances, only a few transport service providers enter the market, charging disproportionately high prices to cover fixed costs and maximize markups.

40|$|Agriculture is {{considered}} a critical sector in attaining economic growth for most economies in Africa. However, for the sector to play its role, {{it needs to be}} commercialised to enable smallholder farmers to participate in markets and, hence, improve their incomes and livelihoods. In most developing economies, smallholder farmers find it difficult to participate in markets because of the numerous constraints and barriers mostly reflected in the transaction costs that make access to input and output markets difficult. When analysing the effects of transaction costs on market participation, much attention has been accorded to farmers while ignoring middlemen/traders who are also part of the marketing system. Furthermore, studies on the effect of transaction costs on market participation tend to focus on grains and cereals while ignoring agrocommodities that are more perishable. The {{purpose of this study was}} to holistically examine the effects of transaction costs on participation of smallholder farmers and middlemen in banana markets of the Great Lakes region in central Africa. The study adopted a non-separable household model which incorporated fixed and proportional transaction costs in the function of maximising utility subject to resource constraints. The Heckman procedure was used to determine the factors affecting the discrete choice of smallholder farmers on whether to sell and quantities to sell while catering for selection biases. Probit analysis was used to determine the farmers’ choice of selling point while the ordinary least squares method was used to analyse the extent of participation of traders. Variables capturing transaction costs in regards to information gathering, negotiating, contracting, monitoring and enforcing of contracts were used in the analyses. The empirical analyses were based on secondary data availed for 2666 farming households and 494 traders located in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The results of the study indicate that fixed and proportional transaction costs distinctly affect the participation of smallholder farmers in markets. Belonging to farmer groups facilitates information exchange which reduces fixed transaction costs and, hence, increases the likelihood of farmers to participate in markets. The size of a household, distance to markets and ownership of transport means, which is linked to proportional transaction costs, influence the extent of farmer participation in markets. The choice of selling point was significantly influenced by household size, the gender of the household head, off farm revenue, access to price information and the extent of remoteness of household. The effects of transaction costs on market participation of smallholder farmers were more evident in the analyses for bananas than in the one for beans. The participation of traders was significantly influenced by gender, trading experience and supply distance which relate to the bargaining prowess, business networks and per unit transport cost, respectively. Interventions geared towards supporting associations for farmers may facilitate information exchange and enhance bargaining and contracting skills which subsequently reduce transaction costs. Policies aimed at supporting investment in rural infrastructure, in terms of <b>feeder</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> and market places, can lead to reduction in transaction costs and thereby enhance participation of farmers and traders in markets.
