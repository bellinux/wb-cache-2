Design Randomised controlled trial with six-month followup. Setting Public teaching hospital gynaecology units with 12, 000 - 13, 000 relevant procedures per year. Participants Six public gynaecology units made up of 62 gynaecologists or trainees allocated at random to intervention group - three, or control group - 3. Intervention An educational strategy that included dissemination of evidence-based guidelines via a problembased interactive workshop facilitated by an opinion leader and a laminated algorithm and guidelines. Main outcome measures The number of hysteroscopies and/or <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettages</b> performed for DUB on women 40 years or less, clinician behaviour change and perceived booking rates of the procedure. Results At six months, there was no significant effect on the number of hysteroscopies and/or <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettages</b> performed but there was an increase in evidence-based behaviour.

40|$|SummaryEvidence as {{to whether}} {{clinician}} has to give specific treatment in all patients of catamenial hemoptysis is unclear. We considered that the current treatment such as long-term usage of hormonal agent or surgery might be excessive for the catamenial hemoptysis. Therefore, we developed prospective observation study with observation strategy and follow-up for the patients. In sequential four patients of catamenial hemoptysis between December 2000 and November 2001, physical examination, chest X-ray, pelvic ultrasonogram and chest CT scan were taken at both the diagnosis and last follow-up. All patients were only observed without specific treatment within the limit of the possibility and followed for average 58 months. Mean age of patients was 23. 5 years (range, 22 – 25 years). All patients {{have a history of}} undertaking one or two <b>dilatations</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettages</b> before diagnosis. The chest CT scans of all patients presented with ground-glass opacities of peripheral location that were disappeared without any residual lesion at last follow-up. Hemoptysis of two patients was spontaneously disappeared after 6 months. In the other two patients, it was greatly lessened in amount and frequency, then clinically insignificant in one. It was disappeared after subsequent 2 months and then relapsed two times in the late of follow-up of another patient. This study suggests that observation only may be an alternative option in the treatment of catamenial hemoptysis...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} article is to describe a modern conservative approach to treating persistent uterine hemorrhage unresponsive to medical therapy, avoiding transfusion and allowing for nonemergent future therapy without the potential complications of transfusion. Six patients with unremitting uterine bleeding were included in the study performed in the Department of Gynecology at an academically affiliated general hospital. Patients underwent successful hydrothermal endometrial ablation after failed medical therapy. This procedure is effective in controlling severe uterine bleeding in patients with large intrauterine fibroids; thus, the number of women being transfused can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 35 - 37) A seaweed extract called laminaria is {{now being}} inserted into the cervix of saline amniocentesis abortion patients at Inglewood General Hospital. Recent studies of <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> suction <b>curettage</b> abortions have proven that laminaria has two major benefits: the first benefit being the safety application in preserving the patient's child-bearing capability, and the second being that it enables the procedure to be performed more easily. An additional major benefit, that of a reduction of patient time in the saline amniocentesis abortion procedure was hypothesized by the author. If this was true patients would benefit economically and {{in the amount of}} hours spent in labor - "patient trauma time". A plan for statistical analysis was designed by the author, designating four factors as possible contributors to the differences in the total amount of time between the infusion of saline and the time of fetal expulsion. These factors were the use of laminaria, the weeks of gestation, the gravidas, and the p. atienes age. For {{the purpose of this study}} the medical records of 1, 114 patients at Inglewood General Hospital were reviewed. Statistical analysis of the data indicated that only laminaria was significant in the reduction of time, and that the time could be reduced even more proportionate to the number of additional laminaria inserted into the cervix...|$|R

Nitrous oxide 70 % in oxygen and thiopentone were used for main-tenance. Both premedicants were tolerated well and no serious haemodynamic or other adverse events occurred. Dexmedetomidine caused moderate reductions in arterial pressure (maxi-mally by 20 %) and heart rate (maximally by 15 %). Atropine was administered to two dex-medetomidine- premedicated patients because of bradycardia < 45 beat min~ 1. Both premedicants decreased the plasma concentrations of nor-adrenaline by about 50 %, but only dexmedeto-midine attenuated the catecholamine response to anaesthesia and surgery. The thiopentone requirements were decreased significantly (P = 0. 003) by both dexmedetomidine (17 %) and midazolam (19 %).

40|$|Introduction: Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} {{is a life}} threating condition of intrauterine and extrauterine gestations which occur at the same time. We report a delayed diagnosed case of heterotopic pregnancy. Case: A 31 year-old primigravida was referred to our Emergency Gynaecology Service complicated by acute abdomen. She had been treated with clomiphene citrate and on admission intrauterine a missed abortus of about 8 weeks complicated by a large subchorionic hematoma was detected. Emergency laparotomy was performed because of diffuse intra-abdominal haemorrhage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the efficiency of lidocaine with that of plain saline for paracervical pain relief during fractional curettage. The double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed on 150 patients presenting from 2004 to 2005 for curettage. The patients were assigned randomly in two groups to receive lidocaine 1 % or normal saline. Number of patients at each group was 75 women. The pain intensity was assessed in four stages: 1) after speculum insertion, 2) during cervical <b>dilatation,</b> 3) during <b>curettage</b> <b>and</b> 4) 30 min after curettage completion. The pain intensity was graded as 0 to 100 according to the Likert Scale. The Mean±SD of pain intensity after speculum insertion, during <b>dilatation,</b> during <b>curettage</b> <b>and</b> 30 min after curettage in lidocaine group were 11. 33 ± 9. 70, 24. 93 ± 15. 36, 37. 00 ± 17. 35, 6. 47 ± 6. 42 and in normal saline group were 11. 73 ± 9. 81, 28. 20 ± 13. 19, 49. 47 ± 21. 55 and 7. 33 ± 6. 22, respectively. There was no significant difference between pain intensity after speculum insertion, during <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> during 30 min after curettage but there was a significant difference in pain intensity during curettage between lidocaine 1 % group and normal saline group (p< 0. 05). Normal saline is as effective as lidocaine 1 % in low pain in curettage (distention of nerve capsule) but when increase pain in curettage (third time point), lidocaine 1 % is more effective than normal saline. Nerve capsule distention is not the only factor for pain control in paracervical block and analgesic agent is still an important factor...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{patterns of}} use of <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettage</b> in Britain as compared {{with those in the}} United States; to examine variations in utilisation rates within one regional health authority. DESIGN [...] Analysis of routinely collected hospital inpatient statistics. SETTING [...] Statistics for England, Scotland, and the United States; local statistics for Oxford region. SUBJECTS [...] All inpatient episodes in which <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettage</b> was performed but excluding those related to pregnancy. RESULTS [...] <b>Dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettage</b> rates remained stable in Britain between 1977 and 1990, whereas in the United States they declined dramatically. In 1989 - 90 the rate was 71. 1 per 10, 000 women in England as compared with only 10. 8 per 10, 000 in America. In 1989, 6936 women underwent diagnostic <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettage</b> in the Oxford region, making it the most common elective operation. A total of 2726 (39 %) of these women were under 40. There was a more than twofold variation in usage of the procedure among district health authorities within the region and even greater variation in rates in women under 40. The proportion of patients treated as day cases in the district general hospitals ranged from 22 % to 82 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettage</b> may frequently be used inappropriately. The considerable variations in usage of <b>dilatation</b> <b>and</b> <b>curettage</b> internationally and nationally indicate differences in clinical perception of its appropriateness.
