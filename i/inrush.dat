5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the <b>inrush</b> current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. USB devices are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.|$|E
5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the caissons {{at the end of}} the dock unexpectedly lifted as the water rose to the level of the harbor (no one had checked to ensure that all the caissons were properly ballasted with seawater). The sudden <b>inrush</b> of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high <b>inrush</b> current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

50|$|In Scotland, the Community Service by Offenders Act 1978 {{introduced}} provisions whereby offenders might, {{under certain}} circumstances, be ordered by courts to undertake community {{work as an}} alternative to a prison sentence. This legislation brought Scotland in line with England and Wales where similar provisions already apply. The Mines (Precautions Against <b>Inrushes)</b> Regulations 1979 applied to all types of mines and made provision for measures to be taken against the hazard of <b>inrushes</b> of water or gas or material which flows when wet.|$|R

25|$|<b>Inrush</b> {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. <b>Inrush</b> current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} <b>inrush</b> current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have <b>inrush</b> currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E
25|$|This {{internal}} DC resistance Ri {{should not}} be confused with the internal AC resistance called equivalent series resistance (ESR) normally specified for capacitors. It is measured at 1kHz. ESR is much smaller than DC resistance. ESR is not relevant for calculating superconductor <b>inrush</b> currents or other peak currents.|$|E

25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as <b>inrush</b> current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|As an <b>inrush</b> {{current limiter}} device in power supply circuits, they present a higher {{resistance}} initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation. These thermistors are usually {{much larger than}} measuring type thermistors, and are purposely designed for this application.|$|E

50|$|In those days, Japanese train ferries did {{not have}} a rear sea-gate, because {{engineers}} believed that <b>inrushing</b> water would simply flow out again quickly and would not pose a danger. However, when the frequency of waves bears the wrong relationship to the length of a ship, each wave arrives as the water from the previous wave is trying to leave, causing water to accumulate on the ship. After the accidents, all Japanese train ferries were retrofitted with rear sea-gates and weather forecast technology was greatly promoted.|$|R

25|$|A {{varistor}} {{provides no}} equipment protection from <b>inrush</b> current surges (during equipment startup), from overcurrent (created {{by a short}} circuit), or from voltage sags (also known as a brownout); it neither senses nor affects such events. Susceptibility of electronic equipment to these other power disturbances is defined by {{other aspects of the}} system design, either inside the equipment itself or externally by means such as a UPS, a voltage regulator or a surge protector with built-in overvoltage protection (which typically consists of a voltage-sensing circuit and a relay for disconnecting the AC input when the voltage reaches a danger threshold).|$|E
25|$|At {{the western}} {{tip of the}} {{peninsula}} is East Pass (also known as Destin Pass), separating it from Santa Rosa Island to the west. East Pass is the only outlet of Choctawhatchee Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, Many sources claim that the current pass was dug by hand with an <b>inrush</b> of water widening it within hours. The early pass appears (at the East end of Destin Harbor) in early maps and surveys from Spanish, French, and English surveyors, such as Thomas Jefferys's 1775 map The Coast of West Florida and Louisiana. Frequent dredging is required to keep East Pass navigable.|$|E
25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of <b>inrush</b> current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.|$|E
