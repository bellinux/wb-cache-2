The removal rates of COD and TP in this examine was obviously lower than the most related facility (Wang et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2012), it {{is due to the}} fact that only two EF tanks (the first tank and the second tank) were concatenated in this study but three tanks were designed in their experiment, added with the big fluctuations of the influent character during the entire year. As can be deduced from our data, the removal efficiency of COD and LAS could be enhanced to satisfaction if the third EF tanks or recycling measures are in further connected to the process. The removal rate of LAS was averaged as 71 %, which mainly attribute to the living plants and the depth of the packing (Huang et al. 2004; Kadewa et al. 2010).

This study presents a full year survey on the performances of various rural wastewater treatment processes at a county level in eastern China including seven three-chamber septic tanks (ST), five micro-power biological facilities (MP), seven constructed wetlands (CW), three stabilization ponds (SP) and five centralized activated sludge treatment plants (AS).
