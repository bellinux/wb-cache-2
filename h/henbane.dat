5|$|Various {{plants are}} said to have apotropaic qualities, notably Mountain Ash. <b>Henbane</b> (Hyoscyamus niger) may have been used as a {{hallucinogen}} as long ago as the Neolithic period. This tradition has recently been taken up once again by New Agers.|$|E
5|$|Cleopatra {{is said to}} have {{poisoned}} {{herself with}} an asp after hearing of Marc Antony's demise. Prior to her death, she was said to have sent many of her maidservants to act as guinea pigs to test different poisons, including belladonna, <b>henbane,</b> and the strychnine tree's seed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} {{times and}} possibly much earlier, hundreds of {{species of plants}} have provided drugs to treat {{a wide range of}} conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, <b>henbane,</b> opium and squill. The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia {{until the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Hyoscyamus — {{known as}} the <b>henbanes</b> — is a small genus of {{flowering}} plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It comprises 11 species, {{all of which are}} toxic. It, along with other genera in the same family, is a source of the drug hyoscyamine (daturine).|$|R
5000|$|Perennial herbs,differing {{in their}} type of {{inflorescence}} - a terminal, cymose panicle or corymbose raceme - {{from the other}} five genera of subtribe Hyoscyaminae within tribe Hyoscyameae of the Solanaceae. Flowers pedunculate (not secund, sessile/subsessile as in Hyoscyamus). Calyx lobes subequal or unequal; corolla campanulate (bell-shaped) or infundibuliform (funnel-shaped), lobes subequal or sometimes unequal, imbricate in bud; stamens inserted at the middle of corolla tube; disk conspicuous; fruiting calyx lobes nonspinescent apically (i.e. lacking the spiny points characteristic of the calyces of the related genus Hyoscyamus - the <b>Henbanes),</b> fruiting calyx inflated, bladder-like or campanulate, loosely enclosing the capsular fruit. Fruit a pyxidium (i.e. dry capsule opening by a distinct operculum ( [...] = lid [...] ) - as in the other five genera of the Hyoscyaminae).Pollen grain polymorphic, usually subspheroidal, oval in polar view, circular-triangular in equatorial view.|$|R
50|$|Atropa is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} nightshade family, Solanaceae : tall, calcicole, herbaceous perennials (rhizomatous hemicryptophytes), bearing large leaves and glossy berries particularly dangerous to children, due to their combination of an attractive, cherry-like appearance with a high toxicity. Atropa species favour temperate climates and alkaline soils, often growing in light shade in woodland environments associated with limestone hills and mountains. Their seeds can remain viable in the soil for long periods, germinating when the soil of sites in which plants once grew (but from which plants have long been absent) is disturbed by human activity or by natural causes, e.g. the windthrow of trees (a property shared by the seeds of other Solanaceae in tribe Hyoscyameae e.g. those of Hyoscyamus spp., the <b>henbanes).</b> The best-known member of the genus Atropa is Deadly Nightshade (A. belladonna) - the poisonous plant par excellence {{in the minds of}} many. The pharmacologically active ingredients of Atropa species include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, all tropane alkaloids having anticholinergic, deliriant, antispasmodic and mydriatic properties. The genus is named for Άτροπος (Atropos) - lit. 'she who may not be turned (aside)' - one of the Three Fates and cutter of the thread of life / bringer of death - in reference to the extreme toxicity of A.belladonna and its fellow species - of which three others are currently accepted.|$|R
25|$|John Arderne (1307-1392) was an English {{physician}} and surgeon who invented his own anesthetic that combined hemlock, <b>henbane,</b> and opium. In his writings, he also described how to properly excise {{and remove the}} abscess caused by anal fistula.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the methods}} for seducing men {{may have been the}} use of drugs. In Fyrkat, the grave of a vǫlva {{revealed}} the use of <b>henbane,</b> a drug which not only produces hallucinations but can also be a powerful aphrodisiac. If Freyja was the goddess of love in Asgard, the vǫlva was her counterpart in Midgard.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} glycoalkaloids, {{of which the}} most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), <b>henbane</b> (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|E
25|$|Snails of {{the same}} species {{collected}} from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: Alyssum, fruit and leaves of apple, apricot, artichoke (a favorite), aster, barley, beans, bindweed, California boxwood, almost any cabbage variety, camomile, carnation, carrot, cauliflower, celeriac (root celery), celery, ripe cherries, chive, citrus, clover, cucumbers (a favorite snail food), dandelion, elder, <b>henbane,</b> hibiscus, hollyhock, kale, larkspur (Consolida or Delphinium genera), leek, lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), lily, magnolia, mountain ash, mulberry, chrysanthemum, nasturtium, nettle, nightshade berries, oats, onion greens, pansy, parsley, peach, ripe pears, peas, petunia, phlox, plum, potatoes (raw or cooked), pumpkins, radish, rape, rose, sorrel, spinach, sweet pea, thistle, tomatoes (well liked), turnip, wheat, yarrow, zinnia. They will eat sweet lupines, but will reject bitter lupines and other plants with high quinolizidine alkaloids. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{hospital}} were operating rooms, kitchens, baths, a dispensary, latrines, a mortuary and herb gardens, as doctors {{relied heavily on}} herbs for drugs. The medici could treat any wound received in battle, {{as long as the}} patient was alive. They operated or otherwise treated with scalpels, hooks, levers, drills, probes, forceps, catheters and arrow-extractors on patients anesthetized with morphine (opium poppy extract) and scopolamine (<b>henbane</b> extract). Instruments were boiled before use. Wounds were washed in vinegar and stitched. Broken bones were placed in traction. There is, however, evidence of wider concerns. A vaginal speculum suggests gynecology was practiced, and an anal speculum implies knowledge that the size and condition of internal organs accessible through the orifices was an indication of health. They could extract eye cataracts with a special needle. Operating room amphitheaters indicate that medical education was ongoing. Many have proposed that the knowledge and practices of the medici were not exceeded until the 20th century CE.|$|E
500|$|De Materia Medica (Latin {{name for}} the Greek work Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, Peri hules iatrikēs, both meaning [...] "On Medical Material") is a {{pharmacopoeia}} of herbs and the medicines that {{can be obtained from}} them. The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, <b>henbane,</b> opium and squill. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.|$|E
500|$|In the 15th century, priest-physician Andrew Boorde {{describes}} a [...] "deworming technique" [...] for the teeth: [...] "And if it [...] do come by worms, make a {{candle of wax}} with <b>Henbane</b> seeds and light it and let the perfume of the candle enter into the tooth and gape over a dish of cold water and then you may take the worms {{out of the water}} and kill them on your nail." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, <b>henbane,</b> and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E

I slept soundly, and without feeling the least uneasiness, and am a great deal better this morning; neither do I find that the <b>henbane</b> has affected my head, which, from the great effect it had upon me--exhilarating me to the most extraordinary degree, and yet keeping me sleepy--I feared it would.
