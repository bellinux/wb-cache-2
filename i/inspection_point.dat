40|$|Analyzing {{inspection}} data is {{an important}} activity in the geometry assurance process, which provides vital information about product and process performance. Since inspection is related to a significant cost, it is desirable with an intelligent inspection preparation where the motive is to gather {{as much information as}} possible about the product and the process with a minimum number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points.</b> In many situations, a large number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> are used despite the fact that only a small subset of points is needed. The reason for this redundancy is that most systems have only a few principal causes affecting groups of variables. In this paper, we use methods of cluster analysis to find these natural groupings of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> and to select one representing point from each cluster. Furthermore, if the relationship between some of the process parameters and <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> are known from experiments or from computer simulations, then the cluster analy sis is combined with sensitivity-based reduction. In this way, an efficient reduced inspection plan is built up. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology for reduction is verified on an industrial case study and by computer simulations...|$|R
40|$|When {{users of}} source-level {{debugging}} and monitoring programs choose {{to inspect the}} state of the program at a certain line number, it is desirable that effects of logically prior source statements be in the picture presented to the user, and that effects of subsequent statements not be in it. However, as optimizations change, drop and reorder code fragments, concerted effort is required of the compiler and the debug information consumer to select appropriate <b>inspection</b> <b>points,</b> and to reconstruct coherent pictures for the user. We propose a robust method for the compiler to select and annotate meaningful, consistent <b>inspection</b> <b>points,</b> and debug information extensions to support multiple coherent pictures at a single program location. They enable debug information consumers to stop at <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> that could not be represented otherwise, and to advance to the user-visible states of subsequent source lines, {{even in the absence of}} intervening executable instructions. ...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the model}} program in {{automotive}} industry gets {{more and more}} extensive, the costs related to inspection increase. Therefore, there are needs for more effective inspection preparation. In this paper a method for {{reducing the number of}} <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> using cluster analysis is tested on production data. This leads to reductions evaluated up to 90 percent in the case studies considered. Furthermore, the relation between movements in locators and the resulting movements in <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> is used to find <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> particularly suited to monitor the fixtures and its locating points. Those same points are used as input to the cluster analysis and chosen as representatives for the clusters. Using cluster analysis, the sample size is an important matter. The sample size, of course, affects the statistical confidence, but {{it is also important to}} choose a sample large enough to contain as many effects as possible related to the different process phenomena that ex ist over time. Those issues are investigated and a sample size lower than 50 items cannot be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} an effective approach {{to solve the}} inspection problem via colored traveling salesman tours. Given an environment with obstacles and regions to be inspected, the approach plans a collision-free and dynamically-feasible motion trajectory that enables the vehicle to inspect all the regions of interest while reducing the distance traveled. A key aspect of the approach is {{the transformation of the}} inspection task into a colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP). This is achieved by generating a number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> on the medial axis of each region in order to increase visibility and by grouping the <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> according to their color. We also contribute a fast CTSP solver based on Monte-Carlo search to effectively find low-cost colored tours. Finally, a vehicle controller is employed in order to follow the planned tour. Experiments using different environments and inspection tasks provide promising validation. I...|$|R

50|$|Deep Content Inspection (DCI) {{is a form}} {{of network}} {{filtering}} that examines an entire file or MIME object as it passes an <b>inspection</b> <b>point,</b> searching for viruses, spam, data loss, key words or other content level criteria. Deep Content Inspection is considered the evolution of Deep Packet Inspection with the ability to look at what the actual content contains instead of focusing on individual or multiple packets. Deep Content Inspection allows services to keep track of content across multiple packets so that the signatures they may be searching for can cross packet boundaries and yet they will still be found. An exhaustive form of network traffic inspection in which Internet traffic is examined across all the seven OSI ISO layers, and most importantly, the application layer.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRelevant {{material}} and environmental parameters are required in modelling chloride ingress into concrete. They could be determined from experimental data (concrete cores taken during inspection) {{but in practice}} data availability is limited by time-consuming and expensive tests. Consequently, the main objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an approach based on Bayesian networks (BN) to improve the parameter identification when inspection data is limited. We aim at proposing appropriate inspection configurations that reduce inspection costs and identification errors for different exposure conditions and materials. It was found that it is possible to define an optimal number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> in depth for allowed identification errors defined by decision makers. The optimal number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> depends on both exposure and material properties. The random variables identified with the improved BN configurations are used to assess the probability of corrosion initiation. The results indicate that the improved BN configurations are useful to identify model parameters even from scarce inspection data...|$|R

50|$|Deep packet {{inspection}} (DPI, {{also called}} complete packet inspection and information extraction or IX) {{is a form}} of computer network packet filtering that examines the data part (and possibly also the header) of a packet as it passes an <b>inspection</b> <b>point,</b> searching for protocol non-compliance, viruses, spam, intrusions, or defined criteria to decide whether the packet may pass or if it needs to be routed to a different destination, or, for the purpose of collecting statistical information that functions at the Application layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection model). There are multiple headers for IP packets; network equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called stateful packet inspection) despite this definition.|$|E

The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important tourism industry. Eastern Air Lines, which had a hub at Miami International Airport, saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only airline to establish jet service to Key West International Airport, counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles.|$|E

40|$|The stack-based {{access control}} {{mechanism}} plays {{a fundamental role in}} the security architecture of Java and Microsoft CLR (common language runtime). It is enforced at runtime by inspecting methods in the current call stack for granted permissions before the program performs safety-critical operations. Although stack inspection is well studied, there is relatively little work on automated generation of access control policies, and most existing work on inferring security policies assume the permissions to be checked at stack <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> are known beforehand. Practiced approaches to generating access control policies are still manually done by developers based on domain-specific knowledges and trial-and-error testing. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to automated generation of access control policies for Java programs that necessarily ensure the program to pass stack inspection. The techniques are abstract interpretation based context-sensitive static program analyses. Our analysis models the program by combining a context-sensitive call graph with a dependency graph.

50|$|The current {{westbound}} tunnel from Norfolk to Hampton is {{the original}} tunnel constructed in 1957 and has a lower clearance than the newer eastbound tube built in the 1970s—13 ft as opposed to 14 ft. Because of this, special over-height detectors have been installed near the Willoughby Spit end of the bridge. If a truck makes it beyond this <b>inspection</b> <b>point</b> and trips the over height sensor, the truck will be alerted and flagged to stop prior to {{the entrance to the}} tunnel, where with a fine of up to $2,500 if the over height occurs during rush hour.
