40|$|ABSTRACT—Despite {{evidence}} for memory skill early in de-velopment, the evidence reviewed here shows that early-acquiredmemories, in rats andhumans, are frozen in time. That is, {{in the absence}} of opportunities for updating, early memories are only expressed via responses or words that were available at the time of encoding. We discuss the theoretical importance of these findings and their potential clinical and forensic implications. KEYWORDS—memory; development; fear; language While there is substantial evidence that infants of many species are capable of learning and remembering, developmental changes in these processes may limit access to early memories later in life.

5000|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> (the {{absence of}} memory {{for the first}} years of life) occurs because the verbal left {{hemisphere}} becomes activated later, in the second or third year of life, after the non-verbal right hemisphere.

5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is not specific to humans.

[...] The importance of animal model research should not be understated as these studies have informed neurobiological findings about childhood amnesia and would be impossible to ethically conduct in humans. Because <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> has been observed in animals, the occurrence cannot be explained just by cognition specific to humans such as language or an understanding of ‘self.’ Of course, a main criticism of animal models is that development and cognition in animals and humans are starkly different. Researchers have attempted to address this by creating timelines for animal development based on changes in learning and memory abilities, brain development, and hormones.|$|E

There are many striking aspects to this opening passage from a popular novel, The Tiger’s Wife, including its sense of strong love for the grandfather and its aura of nostalgia for the experiences of the past.

How-ever, for now, let us simply note that the various approaches differ along several dimensions. One dimension is whether or not neural substrates are considered.

50|$|In fact, {{the term}} 'infantile amnesia' {{refers to the}} {{phenomenon}} of accelerated forgetting during infancy.

A review of the literature from behavioral neuroscientist Dr Jee Hyun Kim suggests that accelerated forgetting during early life is at least partly due to rapid growth of the brain during this period.|$|E

50|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is the {{tendency}} to have few autobiographical memories from below the age of 2-4.This {{can be attributed to}} lack of memory rehearsal; young children do not engage in rehearsal of remembered information. There are two theoretical explanations for why this may occur; although they take different approaches, they are not mutually exclusive of each other. The development of a cognitive self is also thought by some to have an effect on encoding and storing early memories.|$|E
50|$|Autobiographical {{memories}} {{can only}} begin to form after infants {{have developed a}} sense of self to whom events having personal significance can occur. Evidence of {{a sense of self}} develops {{towards the end of the}} second year of life, in between 21 and 24 months of age. The development of a cognitive self provides a new framework from which memories can be organized. With this cognitive advancement, we see the emergence of autobiographical memory and the end of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{concerns}} {{memories from}} very early childhood, before age 6; very few memories before age 3 are available. The retention function is the recollection {{of events in}} the first 20 to 30 most recent years of an individual's life. This results in more memories for events closest to the present, a recency effect. Finally, there is the reminiscence bump occurring after around age 40, marked by an increase in the retrieval of memories from ages 10 to 30. For adolescents and young adults the reminiscence bump and the recency effect coincide.|$|E
5000|$|Age is a {{significant}} factor that effects memory. There is tremendous evidence that infants can learn and remember. However, <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is an important, yet difficult area to study. Events from infancy simply cannot be remembered. Many studies have {{tried and failed to}} determine the cause of this. Consequently, many theories have been developed to explain this phenomenon. These theories range from the Freudian psychodynamic theory that remembering events from infancy would be damaging to the [...] "ego", to theories that explain the underdeveloped hippocampus of an infant, and also theories that conclude that infants have not yet developed autonoetic consciousness of having experienced remembered events. This theory relies on Tulving's view of episodic memory.|$|E

50|$|Childhood memory {{refers to}} {{memories}} formed during childhood. Among its other roles, memory functions to guide present behaviour and to predict future outcomes. Memory in childhood is qualitatively and quantitatively {{different from the}} memories formed and retrieved in late adolescence and the adult years. Childhood memory research is relatively recent {{in relation to the}} study of other types of cognitive processes underpinning behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms by which memories in childhood are encoded and later retrieved has important implications in many areas. Research into childhood memory includes topics such as childhood memory formation and retrieval mechanisms in relation to those in adults, controversies surrounding <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> and the fact that adults have relatively poor memories of early childhood, the ways in which school environment and family environment influence memory, {{and the ways in which}} memory can be improved in childhood to improve overall cognition, performance in school, and well-being, both in childhood and in adulthood.|$|E
5000|$|Research {{into the}} neural {{substrates}} of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> using animal models {{has found that}} the major inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) may be involved in the regulation of retrieval of infantile memories in adults. [...] GABA activity is known to be higher in early childhood development than it is in adulthood, not just in animals but also in humans. Researchers have hypothesized that increased GABA activity in development has an effect on memory retrieval later in life. Past studies have shown that GABA aids in forgetting of fear memories in infancy and that it may be a general mechanism for regulating infant memory retrieval. [...] Interestingly, this can be seen in humans. Benzodiazepines are a class of psychiatric medication which increase GABA expression and are known to produce anterograde amnesia, or a failure to encode memories after taking the medication. [...] Subjects taking benzodiazepines are found to perform worse on learning and memory tasks compared to drug-naive subjects.|$|E
5000|$|Childhood amnesia {{was first}} {{formally}} reported by psychologist Caroline Miles {{in her article}} [...] "A study of individual psychology", published in 1893 by the American Journal of Psychology. Five years later, Henri and Henri published a survey showing that most respondents’ earliest recollections occurred {{between the ages of}} two and four. In 1904 G. Stanley Hall noted the phenomenon in his book, Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education. In 1910, Sigmund Freud offered {{one of the most famous}} and controversial descriptions and explanations of childhood amnesia. Using psychoanalytic theory, he postulated that early life events were repressed due to their inappropriately sexual nature. He asserted that childhood or <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> was a precursor to the ‘hysterical amnesia,’ or repression, presented by his adult patients. Freud asked his patients to recall their earliest memories and found that they had difficulty remembering events from before the ages of 6-8. Freud coined the term [...] "infantile" [...] or [...] "childhood amnesia" [...] and discussed this phenomenon in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. In 1972, Campbell and Spear published a seminal review about childhood amnesia in Psychological Sciences recapping the research conducted to understand this topic from neurological and behavioral perspectives in both human and animal models.|$|E
50|$|Childhood amnesia, {{also called}} <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia,</b> is the {{inability}} of adults to retrieve episodic memories which are memories of specific events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual who, what, when, and where) {{before the age of}} 2-4 years, as well as the period before age 10 of which adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time. The development of a cognitive self is also thought by some to have an effect on encoding and storing early memories. Some research has demonstrated that children can remember events from the age of 1, but that these memories may decline as children get older. Most psychologists differ in defining the offset of childhood amnesia. Some define it as the age from which a first memory can be retrieved. This is usually at the age of 3 or 4, but it can range from 2 to 8 years. Changes in encoding, storage and retrieval of memories during early childhood are all important when considering childhood amnesia. Some other research shows differences between gender and culture, which is implicated in the development of language. Childhood amnesia is particularly important to consider in regard to false memories and the development of the brain in early years. Proposed explanations of childhood amnesia are Freud's trauma theory, neurological development, development of the cognitive self, emotion and language.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{the role of}} the endogenous opioid system in <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> for contextual fear conditioning. Rats that were 18 days of age received an aversive footshock in a novel context. Rats displayed conditioned fear when tested 1 min after training but not 24 hr after training. Systemic injection of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone prior to test, but not immediately after training, alleviated <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Naloxone also alleviated <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> when injected prior to test 7 days after training. These effects of naloxone were due to actions on central rather than peripheral opioid receptors and were not due to any tendency of the drug to produce fear or freezing. These results show that central opioid receptors regulate retrieval of fear memories in infant rats...|$|E
40|$|The {{current state}} of {{knowledge}} concerning <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is presented. A brief overview of the developmental neuroscience relevant to early memory development is presented first. Because regions relevant to episodic memory (hippocampus and parahippocampal areas) have {{a high degree of}} overlap between human and nonhuman animals in their development, anatomy, and function, it is argued that episodic memory may exist across a number of species. If one of the hallmarks of episodic memory is faster forgetting of information in immature than more mature members of the species, then it is likely that <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> may be species invariant. Following this line of reasoning, the literature on human and nonhuman animal <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is reviewed. It is argued that an adequate theory of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> must account for the entire literature, human and nonhuman animal alike. A theory of this sort is presented, one that emphasizes the continuity of basic memory processes (encoding, storage, retention, and retrieval) across species and development and that capitalizes on changes in knowledge structures unique to different species, ones that may be controlled by across-species variation in the neocortical areas that modulate input and output to the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is a {{ubiquitous}} phenomenon, but its neural bases {{remain largely}} unknown. The authors identify {{a role for}} GABAergic transmission in suppressing retrieval of memories acquired in infancy. Eighteen-day-old rats received pairings of white noise and shock; considerable forgetting of this experience (assessed by freezing) occurred after 10 days. The memory was recovered by pretest administration of the GABAA inverse agonist FG 7142 10 days, but not 2 months, after training. This effect of FG 7142 generalized when a passive avoidance procedure was used. Also, FG 7142 decreased fear of a latently inhibited conditioned stimulus, showing that the observed memory recovery effect was not due to a state-dependent process. It appears that GABA {{may be involved in}} <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> regardless of the emotional content of the memory...|$|E
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study of nine children examined two issues concerning infantile amnesia: the time at which memories for events experienced {{before the age of}} 3 - 4 years disappear from consciousness and whether this timing of memory loss is related to the development of specific aspects of episodic and autobiographical memory. This study followed children from infancy to early childhood and examined the central role of three verbal-cognitive milestones related to autobiographical memory: the age at which children begin to report autobiographical memories using the past tense (Milestone 1); the age at which they begin to verbally acknowledge past events (Milestone 2); and the age at which they begin to spontaneously use memory-related verbs (Milestone 3). As expected, memories of events that occurred before 3 - 4 years of age were affected by <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Achievement of these milestones followed almost the same developmental progression: Milestone 1 (1 year; 10 months (1; 10) to 3 years; 4 months (3; 4)) was followed by Milestones 2 (3; 1 to 4; 0) and 3 (3; 5 to 4; 4). Milestone 2 was typically related to the onset of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia,</b> whereas Milestone 1 occurred during the period for which the children became amnesic as they aged. These data suggest that linguistic meta-cognitive awareness of personal memory is the key feature in <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{predictions}} of M. L. Howe and M. L. Courage's (1993, 1997) theory of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> compared with a social-interactionist account of autobiographical memory development (R. Fivush & E. Reese, 1992; K. Nelson, 1993 b). Fifty-eight mother-child dyads were assessed for maternal styles of talking about the past and for children's self-recognition, language production, and nonverbal memory when the children were 19 months old. Children's shared and independent memory reports were then assessed from 19 to 32 months. Maternal reminiscing style and self-recognition uniquely predicted children's shared memory reports across time, even with children's initial language and nonverbal memory factored out. Self-recognition skills also predicted children's later independent memory. These results support a pluralistic account {{of the origins of}} autobiographical memory. Autobiographical memories are specific, long-lasting, and usu-ally of significance to one's self-concept (K. Nelson, 1993 b). One unusual feature of the autobiographical memory system is that as adults, we are typically unable to recall events that occurred before the age of around 3 years, a phenomenon known as <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> (e. g., Dudycha & Dudycha, 1941; Pillemer & White...|$|E

40|$|Episodic {{memories}} for autobiographical events {{that happen in}} unique spatiotemporal contexts are central to defining who we are. Yet, before 2 years of age, children are unable to form or store episodic {{memories for}} recall later in life, a phenomenon known as <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Here, we studied the development of allocentric spatial memory, a fundamental component of episodic memory, in two versions of a real-world memory task requiring 18 month- to 5 -year-old children to search for rewards hidden beneath cups distributed in an open-field arena. Whereas children 25 - 42 -months-old were not capable of discriminating three reward locations among 18 possible locations in absence of local cues marking these locations, children older than 43 months found the reward locations reliably. These results support previous findings suggesting that allocentric spatial memory, if present, is only rudimentary in children under 3. 5 years of age. However, when tested with only one reward location among four possible locations, children 25 - 39 -months-old found the reward reliably in absence of local cues, whereas 18 - 23 -month-olds did not. Our findings thus show {{that the ability to}} form a basic allocentric representation of the environment is present by 2 years of age, and its emergence coincides temporally with the offset of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia.</b> However, the ability of children to distinguish and remember closely related spatial locations improves from 2 to 3. 5 years of age, a developmental period marked by persistent deficits in long-term episodic memory known as childhood amnesia. These findings support the hypothesis that the differential maturation of distinct hippocampal circuits contributes to the emergence of specific memory processes during early childhood...|$|E

At follow-up, their age at the time of these memories shifted to several months later, with younger children unlikely to provide the same memories. Moreover, when given cues about memories recalled 2 years previously, many were still not recalled. In contrast, older children were more likely to recall the same memories, and cues to former memories were successful. Thus, older children were becoming consistent in terms of recalling very early memories...|$|E

Forgetting at an intermediate retention interval (1 hr) was not alleviated by the GABAA receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (0, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg), whereas forgetting at a longer retention interval (48 hr) was alleviated. These results suggest that in the developing rat, forgetting observed at different retention intervals is mediated by different physiological mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Adverse {{childhood}} {{experiences can}} deleteriously affect future {{physical and mental}} health, increasing risk for many illnesses, including psychiatric problems, sleep disorders, and, according to the present hypothesis, idiopathic nightmares. Much like post-traumatic nightmares, which are triggered by trauma and lead to recurrent emotional dreaming about the trauma, idiopathic nightmares are hypothesized to originate in early adverse experiences that lead in later life to the expression of early memories and emotions in dream content. Accordingly, the objectives of this paper are to (1) review existing literature on sleep, dreaming and nightmares in relation to early adverse experiences, drawing upon both empirical studies of dreaming and nightmares and books and chapters by recognized nightmare experts and (2) propose {{a new approach to}} explaining nightmares that is based upon the Stress Acceleration Hypothesis of mental illness. The latter stipulates that susceptibility to mental illness is increased by adversity occurring during a developmentally sensitive window for emotional maturation—the <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> period—that ends around age 3 ½. Early adversity accelerates the neural and behavioral maturation of emotional systems governing the expression, learning, and extinction of fear memories and may afford short-term adaptive value. But it also engenders long-term dysfunctional consequences including an increased risk for nightmares. Two mechanisms are proposed: (1) disruption of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> allows normally forgotten early childhood memories to influence later emotions, cognitions and behavior, including the common expression of threats in nightmares; (2) alterations of normal emotion regulation processes of both waking and sleep lead to increased fear sensitivity and less effective fear extinction. These changes influence an affect network previously hypothesized to regulate fear extinction during REM sleep, disruption of which leads to nightmares. This network consists of a fear circuit that includes amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex and whose substantial overlap with the stress acceleration findings allows the latter to be incorporated into a wider, more developmentally coherent framework...|$|E

Its implications for psychoanalytic theory are then examined, yielding fresh views of transference, defense, and treatment. <b>Infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is found to result partially from the immaturity of the declarative memory system, yet procedural memories encode transference expectations and provide continuity in emotional functioning from early childhood onward.

40|$|Allocentric spatial memory, “where” {{with respect}} to the {{surrounding}} environment, is one of the three fundamental components of episodic memory: what, where, when. Whereas basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age, coinciding with the offset of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia,</b> the resolution of allocentric spatial memory acquired over repeated trials improves from 2 to 4 years of age. Here, we first show that single-trial allocentric spatial memory performance improves in children from 3. 5 to 7 years of age, during the typical period of childhood amnesia. Second, we show that large individual variation exists in children's performance at this age. Third, and most importantly, we show that improvements in single-trial allocentric spatial memory performance are due to an increasing ability to spatially and temporally separate locations and events. Such improvements in spatial and temporal processing abilities may contribute to the gradual offset of childhood amnesia...|$|E
40|$|In {{the visual}} paired-comparison task, {{which has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} memory abilities in human infants, Ss view pairs of pictures and then view new pictures paired with old ones. Memory is demonstrated when Ss spend more time looking at new pictures than at old ones.

The results suggest that performance ordinarily depends on the brain structures essential for declarative memory. These and other findings suggest that the visual paired-comparison test also depends on declarative memory when the task is given to human infants. Thus, successful performance on this task by infants probably reflects an early capacity for declarative memory. The relevance of these findings to the phenomenon of <b>infantile</b> <b>amnesia</b> is discussed.
