40|$|This Paper {{shows that}} bank closure {{policies}} {{suffer from a}} ‘too-many-to-fail’ problem: {{when the number of}} bank failures is large, the regulator finds it ex-post optimal to bail out some or all <b>failed</b> <b>banks,</b> whereas when the number of bank failures is small, <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> can be acquired by the surviving banks. This gives banks incentives to herd and increases systemic risk, the risk that many <b>banks</b> may <b>fail</b> together. The ex-post optimal regulation may thus be sub-optimal from an ex-ante standpoint. We formalize this time-inconsistency of bank regulation. We also argue that by allowing <b>banks</b> to purchase <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> at discounted prices and by partially nationalizing the bailed-out banks, a regulator may be able to mitigate the induced systemic risk. bailout; bank regulation; herding; moral hazard; systemic risk...|$|R
25|$|In 1906, {{the city}} {{experienced}} {{a financial crisis}} with the failure of its leading merchant bank, Arbuthnot & Co.

25|$|The Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 {{gives the}} board power {{in areas of}} the law that were {{previously}} uncertain. It removed the zero hour rule that allowed a bankruptcy to date a bankruptcy the previous midnight and the Act made it so payments the same day could not be undone. Before the removal of the zero hour rule, the Real Time Gross Settlement system had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But {{in the event of a}} bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the <b>failed</b> <b>bank.</b> This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves. The ACCC and the Payments Systems Board are encouraged to work together regarding access and rivalry through the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998.|$|E
500|$|As {{his powers}} {{and use of}} powers already suggest in the series, Ben is an Avataric Creature of Light.

After both his grandfather and mother had died from cancer, he was [...] "shanghaied by a group of carnies" [...] in 1930. In a later version closer to the actual series, Ben left his mother's farm at age sixteen and fell into a criminal life in Texas. After receiving a twenty-year sentence in a state prison-farm for a <b>failed</b> <b>bank</b> robbery, Ben planned his escape to return home to his sick mother, but he accidentally killed a prison guard who drew a gun on him. Show creator Daniel Knauf gave the latter as Ben's chain gang background in the series.|$|E
40|$|During 2007 - 10, {{failures}} eliminated 318 U. S. {{commercial banks}} and savings institutions, about 4 {{percent of the}} total number of banks operating at the end of 2006. The assets and deposits of many <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> were acquired by institutions that already had offices in markets served by the <b>failed</b> <b>banks.</b> This article investigates the impact of in-market acquisitions of <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> on the concentration of local U. S. banking markets. Most <b>banks</b> that <b>failed</b> during 2007 - 10 were small, and their acquisitions generally had little impact on market concentration. Acquisitions of larger <b>banks</b> that <b>failed,</b> such as the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank by JPMorgan Chase Bank, also had only limited impact on the concentration of most banking markets. Among large metropolitan statistical area markets, the Houston and New York City banking markets were most affected by the acquisition of Washington Mutual, but these markets remained relatively unconcentrated after the acquisition. Hence, the article finds that except for a few rural banking markets, acquisitions of <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> by in-market competitors generally had only a small impact on market concentration.

40|$|As {{economic}} entities {{become increasingly}} interconnected, a shock {{in a financial}} network can provoke significant cascading failures throughout the system. To study the systemic risk of financial systems, we create a bi-partite banking network model composed of banks and bank assets and propose a cascading failure model to describe the risk propagation process during crises. We empirically test the model with 2007 US commercial banks balance sheet data and compare the model prediction of the <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> with the real <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> after 2007. We find that our model efficiently identifies {{a significant portion of}} the actual <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> reported by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The results suggest that this model could be useful for systemic risk stress testing for financial systems. The model also identifies that commercial rather than residential real estate assets are major culprits for the failure of over 350 US commercial banks during 2008 - 2011.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the banking}} industry, the {{production}} process {{can be described as}} a two-stage process. There are a number of published data envelopment analysis (DEA) papers that study the bank performance with two-stage model. However, none of them is applied to identify bank failure. In fact, only one of them deals with negative profit data. In the real world, <b>failed</b> <b>banks</b> or firms often produced negative profit for several years before they went into bankruptcy. To fit this situation this paper introduces a two-stage worst-practice frontier DEA (WPF-DEA) model that can deal with negative profit data and effectively identify <b>failed</b> <b>bank(s)</b> in the worse-case scenario. This model is applied in an empirical study. The result is then compared with the result from a two-stage best-practice frontier DEA model to show the adequacy of WPF-DEA model for identifying <b>failed</b> <b>bank(s)</b> in the worst-case scenario.
