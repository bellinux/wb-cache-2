But Grace was approached by both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. Grace said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, when he was 20.|$|E
500|$|While in Australia, Chatwin, who {{had been}} {{experiencing}} some health problems, first read about AIDS, then known as the gay plague. It frightened him and compelled him to reconcile with his wife. The fear of AIDS also drove him to finish the book that became The Songlines (1987). His friend the novelist Salman Rushdie said, [...] "That book was an obsession too great for him... His illness did him a favour, got him free of it. Otherwise, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on writing it for ten years." ...|$|E
500|$|Original [...] "Tribbles" [...] creator David Gerrold was {{contacted}} by The New York Times, {{who wanted to}} interview him about the anniversary and the rumored [...] "tribbles" [...] episode. When he questioned Berman about the episode, Berman initially denied it. [...] Gerrold responded that he didn't want to embarrass anyone, but {{would like to be}} able to endorse the project. [...] Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. [...] Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II (1989) and later said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> in a different direction had he written the story. [...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created.|$|E

500|$|According to {{some historians}} and medical experts, Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors {{attending}} him had {{at their disposal}} today's medical research, techniques, and equipment. Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating {{the path of the}} bullet. Several of his doctors inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, a common practice in the 1880s. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's demise. Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation. Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests that [...] "Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today's world, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> home in a matter of two or three days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rossiter's parents {{described}} their six-year battle for justice as [...] "gruelling" [...] but expressed the wish that their son's death {{had not been}} in vain and welcomed the recommendations made by the jury regarding improvements in health and safety, in cases where young people are detained. Rossiter's father said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> further: ...|$|E
2500|$|As a four-year-old, Holy Bull won the Olympic Handicap easily but {{was pulled}} {{up during the}} Donn Handicap. Subsequent {{examinations}} showed a bowed tendon but no permanent injury. [...] "If he wasn't Holy Bull, I'd {{bring him back to}} the races next year", said Croll. [...] "I'm sorry we couldn't finish the year with him. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> out in a blaze of glory. He has courage and class. I'm going to miss him. Everybody's going to miss him." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{invited them}} {{in to take}} a nightcap, and Howard and the judge accepted, but the doctor said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>go</b> and see how Angelo's {{principal}} wound was getting on.|$|R
60|$|Had Matt {{known that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> meet {{three of the}} colored men in the cottage in the hollow, {{it is more than}} likely that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> near the place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] thought Christina, [...] "if I had {{not told}} him I loved Jan, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back to his old ways. Poor old gentleman! No doubt it was despair." ...|$|R
2500|$|Grace {{had been}} [...] "notoriously unscholarly" [...] as a boy. Although {{opportunities}} arose, {{he never went}} to university as his father was intent upon him pursuing a medical career.

In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate.

2500|$|His {{death in}} a ski-ing {{accident}} {{appears to have been}} widely mourned. The Times obituary says: [...] "Frazer was undoubtedly one of the most brilliant all-round men of his generation and all who knew him felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> far." [...] It adds that [...] "it is significant that when his death became known at Davos, the championship ski contest was suspended, although he was not himself a competitor". A response to the original obituary, published 12 days later, talked of his work in physical education with young people in a deprived part of the East End of London; it ends with fulsome praise: [...] "If Jack Frazer was typical and representative of the rising generation, we need not despair of England yet." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> out, but Tomlinson {{laid a hand}} {{upon his}} arm {{and turned to the}} Recorder.|$|E
60|$|But what a fix he was in! What {{a dreadful}} fix! He ached and smarted all over. My goodness, {{how he did}} smart! And to get out <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>go</b> right past the Yellow Jacket home again.|$|R
5000|$|The {{judge said}} the High Court finding Mr Lynch gave [...] "hopelessly {{confused}} and unreliable" [...] evidence <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{ahead with the}} deal unless the loan was non-recourse appeared [...] "amply justified and, if anything, understated".|$|R
60|$|He {{looked to}} see if his car was short of water or petrol; both needed replenishing, and so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>go</b> up the hill into Exeter town again. He got {{into his car and}} sat with his fingers on the {{electric}} starter.|$|R
60|$|Afterwards, when {{he found}} her <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone,</b> but then the sky was clear, the danger-clouds had melted for awhile.|$|E
60|$|By morning Dave {{felt more}} like himself, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> ahead on the hunt, but Barringford would not permit it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right away," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Dodd, breathlessly. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on to exculpate himself, but Mr. Worthington's inexorable finger {{was pointing}} at the door.|$|E
60|$|It took Cliffe {{a minute}} or two to make up his mind. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back to Valverde at once; but he felt that he must finish his {{business}} before returning. Although he had some misgivings, he agreed to stay.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{he told a}} group {{studying}} the Greensboro massacre that <b>he</b> never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to that rally {{had he not been}} goaded.

60|$|And before M. Durand {{could prevent}} him--which {{undoubtedly}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done--Achille <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> {{back to the}} study door and loudly knocked thereat.|$|R

60|$|He had {{a charming}} voice, and he chose his words as he spoke; he uttered them almost rhythmically. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on, but Weeks opened a second bottle of beer.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on, {{but felt}} {{the danger of}} being {{overpowered}} again by those feelings of tenderness so new to his steady nature, that he blushed {{to give way to}} them.|$|E
6000|$|... "The chief {{engineer}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> let <b>go</b> in any case," [...] said the doctor. [...] "He wouldn't {{like to have}} a quarrel with the railway upon his hands.

6000|$|... "Ay, ay, and {{senseless}} {{it was not}} to attend. Then {{it seems}} that something might have been done, at any rate <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on injuring them with his work at Eton, but now it is as good as a lost case. Poor fellow!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{conversation}} between Harry and Sufder {{on the way}} back to the hotel; Harry saying that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> tell the news when Soyera joined them, otherwise <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>go</b> through it twice.

60|$|They {{heard an}} inordinate roar of laughter, {{and there was}} Diabolus sitting {{opposite}} to them, holding his sides, and lashing his tail about, as if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> mad with glee.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there was}} one night, I am afraid, I did not stand by a little fellow that they bullied about his prayers. Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on, if I had helped him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the easy}} {{friendliness}} {{of all of}} them that most made Milt feel like an outsider. If a servant had come out and ordered him away, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> meekly ... he fancied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then {{should he}} burden {{himself with a}} companion? His money, {{whatever}} <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> further without such impediment." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>gone,</b> {{and the lives}} of these two people thus brought into natural yet mysterious contact have flowed on {{unchanged}} in each monotonous current.

60|$|He lit a {{cigarette}} {{and sat down on the}} sofa, and the chief feeling in his heart was a strange hope, a sort of funereal gladness. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>go</b> and see her at once, that very night; an excuse--no need to wait in here--to wait--wait on the chance of her coming.|$|R
