40|$|LectureBarrios (2007) {{conducted}} an experimental work in which was {{demonstrated that the}} two-phase stage performance of an electrical submersible pump (ESP) {{is related to the}} impeller gas and liquid flow pattern as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) for a volute-type centrifugal pump. Barrios (2007) proved that the stage head breakdown is a consequence of the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation in the impeller channel as in a volute type pump. However, the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> is described as unstable by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) so a slug-flow-like pattern is observed in the impeller channel at the head breakdown conditions. Barrios (2007) observed that the gas segregates near the back shroud after the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation so that it is stable and a gas segregated pattern is observed into the impeller. The discrepancy between both studies may imply that different mechanisms are acting in the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation and its stability, which finally affects the stage performance. The objective of this research is to study the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> behavior through the visualization of the flow pattern within an ESP impeller at different operating conditions and fluid properties. Therefore, a series of experimental tests has been conducted utilizing a two-stage prototype at rotational speeds between 600 rpm and 1000 rpm, 2 psig inlet pressure and volumetric gas fraction up to 10 percent. This prototype was built with a transparent acrylic casing to easily observe the flow pattern within the impeller, at the diffuser region and at the impeller inlet region. The gas and liquid flow patterns are observed from videos taken with high speed cameras. Two ports for gas injection have been disposed so the gas can be injected directly to the impeller inlet to get the single stage performance or through the first stage to obtain the multistage performance. A combination of different fluids such as distilled water and air, distilled water and sulfur hexafluoride, and air and a mixture of isopropanol (IPA) and water was utilized in this study. The videos show that the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> is small and located near the front shroud at liquid flow rates higher than stage best efficiency point (BEP). It is formed and dragged out by liquid flowing over the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a). The <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> becomes stable once it has grown through the channel cross section area when the liquid flow rate is reduced down to BEP. At this operating condition, the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> reduces the upper flowing area and forces the liquid to flow in the remaining area between the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> and the trailing channel face. Further reduction of liquid flow rate below the BEP causes the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> to segregate forcing the liquid to flow underneath as Barrios (2007) mentioned. The <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> is formed even at zero head, which demonstrates that it is a consequence of bubble coalescence within impeller channel. The critical gas fraction for the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> formation varies as a function of gas density while its stability and formation {{is a function of the}} surface tension and bubble size...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution for the}} combustion of an infinite linear array of gaseous fuel pockets in a stagnant oxidizing environment under microgravity conditions is discussed. The <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> combustion is described using the generalized Shvab-Zeldovich formulation with nonunitary Lewis number. The combustion process is considered isobaric and the flow is induced by density gradients due to the heat and mass transfer processes (Stefan flow). The model is based on mass, momentum, excess enthalpy, and mixture fraction conservation equations and considers the Burke-Schumann reaction mechanism and ideal gas behavior. The thermophysical properties, except the density, are assumed constant. The finite-volume method is employed in the {{numerical solution}}, using a generalized system of coordinates. A nonstaggered grid is used and the SIMPLEC algorithm is employed to solve the modified pressure-velocity coupling. Nonunitary Lewis number and interaction effects on flame behavior and on the fuel consumption are analyzed. Results show that the nonunitary Lewis number can modify the interaction effects on <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> linear array combustion. During the combustion process, the flame can evolve from individual flames around each <b>gas</b> fuel <b>pocket</b> to a merged flame, surrounding the merged fuel region. However, under certain conditions, the merged flame and the merged fuel region can be broken, returning to individual flames around each <b>gas</b> fuel <b>pocket.</b> Pages: 784 - 80...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the time {{relation}} of the expansion of a <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> and failure of its overlying plug of lava during Vulcanian eruptions, infrasound records and video images of the Vulcanian eruption that occurred at Sakurajima volcano on January 2, 2007 were analyzed {{with respect to their}} origin times. Weak (≤ 3 Pa) and slowly increasing air pressure preceded the impulsive compression phase by 0. 25 - 0. 32 s, and a longer-period rarefaction phase of infrasound waves was recognized at all microphone stations. The velocity of the compression phase was assumed to be supersonic (ca. 400 m/s) up to 850 m above the crater bottom from other recent explosions. On the other hand, the propagation velocity of the preceding weak signal was regarded to be similar to the air sound velocity because the lack of impulsiveness is unlikely {{to be related to the}} main compression phase. Therefore, the estimated origin time of the main compression phase was delayed by 0. 5 - 0. 7 s from the preceding phase. The origin time of the preceding phase coincided with the onset of the isotropic expansion process of the pressurized <b>gas</b> <b>pocket,</b> which was obtained by the waveform inversion of the explosion earthquake. In contrast, the origin time of the main impulsive phase coincided with the time when the expansion rate reached its peak. This observation suggests that the volumetric increase of the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> caused swelling of the surface of the crater bottom and its subsequent failure. When the expansion velocity exceeded a threshold level, the main impulsive compression phase radiated with a high velocity by the sudden releases of the pressurized gases. The volumetric change at the source was estimated to be 280 - 560 m 3 from the preceding phase of the infrasound. This volume change indicates that the vertical displacement of the swelling ground was on the order of 1. 0 m, assuming the radius of the lava plug was ca. 10 m...|$|R
40|$|Pockmarks form where fluids {{discharge}} through seafloor sediments rapidly {{enough to}} make them quick, and are common where gas is present in near-seafloor sediments. This paper investigates how gas might lead to pockmark formation. The process is envisioned as follows: a capillary seal traps gas beneath a fine-grained sediment layer or layers. perhaps layers whose pores have been reduced in size by hydrate crystallization. Gas accumulates until its pressure is sufficient for gas to invade the seal. The seal then fails completely (a unique aspect of capillary seals), releasing a large fraction of the accumulated gas into an upward-propagating gas chimney, which displaces water like a piston as it rises. Near the seafloor the water flow causes the sediments to become "quick" (i. e., liquefied) {{in the sense that}} grain-to-grain contact is lost and the grains are suspended dynamically by the upward flow. The quickened sediment is removed by ocean-bottom currents, and a pockmark is formed. Equations that approximately describe this gas-piston-water-drive show that deformation of the sediments above the chimney and water flow fast enough to quicken the sediments begins when the gas chimney reaches half way from the base of its source <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> to the seafloor. For uniform near-surface sediment permeability, this is a buoyancy control, not a permeability control. The rate the gas chimney grows depends on sediment permeability and the ratio of the depth below seafloor of the top of the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> to the thickness of the <b>gas</b> <b>pocket</b> at the time of seal failure. Plausible estimates of these parameters suggest gas chimneys at Blake Ridge could reach the seafloor in less than a decade or more than a century, depending mainly on the permeability of the deforming near-surface sediments. Since these become quick before gas is expelled, gas venting will not provide a useful warning of the seafloor instabilities that are related to pockmark formation. However, detecting gas chimney growth might be a useful risk predictor. Any area underlain by a gas chimney that extends half way or more to the surface should be avoided. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
