5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas <b>in</b> <b>bearing</b> narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target <b>in</b> <b>bearing,</b> elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E

25|$|For {{detecting}} the targets, GL was largely ineffective. From a mechanical standpoint, {{the need to}} swing the entire system around for tracking presented a major problem. A more serious limitation was the displays themselves, which showed {{only a small portion}} of the sky in the range display, and a single on-target/off-target indication <b>in</b> <b>bearing.</b> Although it might be possible to swing the antenna <b>in</b> <b>bearing</b> to find a target, the direction was accurate to only 20 degrees, enough to keep the antennas aligned with the target, but of little use directing optical instruments onto a target, especially at night. Additionally, the bearing display only showed whether the antennas were aligned or not, but not to which side or the other the target lay if it was mis-aligned, requiring more work to determine which direction to turn the antenna for tracking.|$|E

50|$|Oilite is a porous bronze or {{iron alloy}} {{commonly}} impregnated with an oil lubricant and used <b>in</b> <b>bearings.</b> The original Oilite and Oilite Plus are bronze alloys, while Super Oilite and Super Oilite 16 are iron-based.

Chrysler sold approximately 500,000 Oilite <b>bearings</b> <b>in</b> 1930 and approximately 2.5 million the next year. The Super Oilite was introduced in 1932. Overall sales of all Oilite material in 1932 was seven million; this rose to 18 million in 1933. Oilite was a profit center for Chrysler during this time. Currently, the Oilite trademark belongs to Beemer Precision.|$|R

25|$|The {{questions}} were {{by no means}} restricted to practical problems, but many of them, in case the interpretation of a halakic or haggadic passage in the Talmud was the subject of inquiry, were theoretical in nature.

Even in responsa that are practical <b>in</b> <b>bearing,</b> a distinction may be drawn between the two schools. Although these response can still be found in significant response anthologies today, they are not as significant as the response written during the Geonic period.|$|E
40|$|DISORDERS of {{the blood}} <b>in</b> mice <b>bearing</b> tumours have {{repeatedly}} been described. The first disorder to draw attention was leucocytosis; Pappenheim (1911) stated that leucocyte counts can reach very high values even <b>in</b> mice <b>bearing</b> small tumours. The first reports on increased blood volume <b>in</b> rats <b>bearing</b> sarcomata date back to about the same period (Gussio, 1911). It was not until 1946, however, that Furth and Sobel (1946) and other investigators, presented detailed reports on increased blood volume <b>in</b> mice <b>bearing</b> tumours, particularly ovarian tumours. It is surprising that anaemia in tumour-bearing animals received no special attention, whereas the literature comprises numerous reports on anaemia in cancer patients.

25|$|The first GL set was a crude design {{developed}} during the 1930s. Based on Chain Home, GL used separate transmitters and receivers located in wooden cabins mounted on gun carriages, {{each with its own}} large antenna that had to be rotated to point at the target. The antenna produced a signal that was semi-directional and was only capable of providing accurate slant range information; it could not locate a target better than about 20 degrees <b>in</b> <b>bearing,</b> and did not provide elevation information at all. A number were deployed with the British Expeditionary Force and at least one was captured by German forces during the Dunkirk evacuation. Their evaluation led them to hold a low opinion of British radar systems.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a Squad Leader in a Rifle Platoon of Company A, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces during the defense of Hill 532, south of Sudong, Korea, on 4 November 1950. When a vastly outnumbering, well-concealed hostile force launched a sudden, vicious counterattack against his platoon's hasty defensive position, Sergeant Poynter displayed superb skill and courage in leading his squad and directing its fire against the onrushing enemy. With his ranks critically depleted by casualties and he himself critically wounded as the onslaught gained momentum and the hostile force surrounded his position, he seized his bayonet and engaged in bitter hand-to-hand combat as the break-through continued. Observing three machine guns closing in at a distance of twelve-five yards, he dashed from his position and, grasping hand grenades from fallen Marines as he ran, charged the emplacements in rapid succession, killing the crews of two and putting the other out of action before he fell, mortally wounded. By his self-sacrificing and valiant conduct, Sergeant Poynter inspired the remaining members of his squad to heroic endeavor <b>in</b> <b>bearing</b> down upon and repelling the disorganized enemy, thereby enabling the platoon to move out of the trap to a more favorable tactical position. His indomitable fighting spirit, fortitude and great personal valor maintained in the face of overwhelming odds sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

500|$|By late 1939 it was {{realized}} that {{the rotation of the}} beam on the radar display could be accomplished using electronics.

The result was a 360 degree view of the airspace around the radar. Six copies of the prototype Ground Control Interception radars (GCI) were hand-built at AMES (Air Ministry Experimental Station) and RAE during November and December 1940, and the first went operational at RAF Sopley on New Year's Day 1941, with the rest following {{by the end of the}} month.

500|$|The {{problem was}} finding a radar that was {{suitably}} small; CH radar's huge towers obviously {{could not be}} swung about in this fashion.

These systems were initially rotated by pedalling on a bicycle frame driving a gear set. A joke of the era [...] "was that one could always identify one of the W.A.A.F. R.D.F. operators by her bulging calf muscles and unusually slim figure". Motorized controls for CHL were introduced in April 1941.|$|E
40|$|Feature {{extraction}} and fault severity classification <b>in</b> ball <b>bearings</b> Aditya Sharma, M Amarnath and PK Kankar The {{present study}} attempts to diagnose severity of faults <b>in</b> ball <b>bearings</b> using various machine learning techniques, like {{support vector machine}} (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN).
