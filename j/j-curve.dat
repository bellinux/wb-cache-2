40|$|Abstract. We {{define the}} notion of tame {{elliptic}} structure E on CP 2, which generalizes an almost complex structure J on which the standard symplectic form is positive. An E-curve is a surface in V which is everywhere tangent to E (J-holomorphic in the almost complex case), and an E-line is an E-curve of degree 1. We show that the space V ∗ of E-lines is itself a complex projective plane with a tame elliptic structure E ∗. Moreover, to each E-curve one can associate its dual in V ∗, which is an E ∗-curve.

40|$|This paper investigates {{both the}} effects of {{domestic}} monetary policy and external shocks on fundamental macroeconomic variables in six fast growing emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and Turkey - denoted hereafter as BRICS_T. The authors adopt a structural VAR model with a block exogeneity procedure to identify domestic monetary policy shocks and external shocks. Their research reveals that a contractionary monetary policy in most countries appreciates the domestic currency, increases interest rates, effectively controls inflation rates and reduces output. They do not find any evidence of the price, output, exchange rates and trade puzzles that are usually found in VAR studies. Their findings imply that the exchange rate is the main transmission mechanism in BRICS_T economies. The authors also find that that there are inverse <b>J-curves</b> {{in five of the}} six fast growing emerging economies and there are deviations from UIP (Uncovered Interest Parity) in response to a contractionary monetary policy in those countries.

40|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{collapse}} of socialism, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union fell into a serious economic crisis, after which they experienced a gradual recovery.

In this paper, we perform a comparative meta-analysis of the effect size and statistical significance of structural change, transformation policy, the legacy of socialism, inflation, and regional conflict in order to elucidate the mechanism that generated the J-shaped trajectory in transition economies. The meta-synthesis, which employs 3, 279 estimates drawn from 123 previous studies, revealed that while the growth-enhancing effects of structural change and transformation policy were small yet significant, inflation and regional conflict had a highly significant and strongly negative effect on output.

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{longitudinal}} association between {{body mass index}} (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with mortality and incident disability in Lc 65 + cohort. Design: Population-based cohort of non-institutionalized adults with up to 8. 9 years of follow-up. Setting: City of Lausanne, Switzerland. Participants: 1, 293 individuals aged 65 to 70 at baseline (58 % women). Measurements: BMI, WC and covariates were measured at baseline in 2004 - 2005. Vital status was obtained up to the 31 st December 2013 and difficulty with basic {{activities of daily living}} (BADL) was reported in a self-administered questionnaire sent to participants every year. Main outcomes were total mortality and disability, defined as difficulty with BADL for ≥ 2 years or institutionalization. Cox regression was used with BMI/WC quintiles 2 as the reference. Results: 130 persons died over a median follow-up of 8. 47 years (crude mortality rate, men: 16. 5 / 1, 000 person-years, women: 9. 7 / 1, 000 person-years). In Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, education, financial situation, smoking and involuntary weight loss (IWL) at baseline, mortality was significantly associated with neither BMI nor WC, but there were trends towards non-significant <b>J-curves</b> across both BMI and WC quintiles. Disability (231 cases) tended to increase monotonically across both BMI and WC quintiles and was significantly associated with BMI quintile 5 (HR= 2. 44, 95 % CI [1. 65 - 3. 63]), and WC quintiles 4 (HR= 1. 81 [1. 15 - 2. 85]) and 5 (HR= 2. 58, [1. 67 - 4. 00]). Conclusion: Almost half of the study population had a substantially increased HR of disability, as compared to the reference BMI/WC categories.

50|$|In economics, the 'J curve' {{refers to}} the trend of a country’s trade balance {{following}} a devaluation or depreciation under a certain set of assumptions. A devalued currency means imports are more expensive, and {{on the assumption that}} the volume of imports and exports change little immediately, this causes a depreciation of the current account (a bigger deficit or smaller surplus). After some time, though, the volume of exports may start to rise because of their lower more competitive prices to foreign buyers, and domestic consumers may buy fewer of the costlier imports. Eventually, if this happens, the trade balance should improve on what it was before the devaluation. Likewise, if there is a currency revaluation or appreciation the same reasoning may be applied and will lead to an inverted <b>J-curve.</b>|$|E

50|$|Empirically, it {{has been}} found that trade in goods tends to be inelastic in the short term, as it takes time to change {{consuming}} patterns and trade contracts. Thus, the Marshall-Lerner condition is not met, and a devaluation is likely to worsen the trade balance initially. In the long term, consumers will adjust to the new prices, and trade balance will improve. This effect is called the <b>J-curve</b> effect. For example, assume a country is a net importer of oil and a net producer of ships. Initially, the devaluation immediately increases the price of oil, and as consumption patterns remain the same in the short term, an increased sum is spent on imported oil, worsening the deficit on the import side. Meanwhile, it takes some time for the shipbuilder's sales department to exploit the lower price and secure new contracts. Only the funds acquired from previously agreed contracts, now devalued by the currency devaluation, are immediately available, again worsening the deficit on the export side.|$|E
