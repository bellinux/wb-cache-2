5|$|Homestead {{was mostly}} flooded underwater, {{with the first}} floor of city hall and the fire {{department}} completely flooded and nearly all its residences destroyed. The historical Horde Hardware building collapsed while a local church was <b>flatted</b> by the winds. In the Florida Keys, hundreds of residences were damaged. The Florida East Coast Railway station at Goulds collapsed. Crop losses was estimated to be $4million and most of its avocado harvest was destroyed. Four people died across the state.|$|E
5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and <b>flatted</b> accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the {{built environment}} is poor.|$|E
5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in the rural South {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a <b>flatted</b> or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{influenced}} many performers of all {{the major}} styles of later popular music, though jazz itself never again became such {{a major part of}} American popular music as during the swing era. The later 20th-century American jazz scene did, however, produce some popular crossover stars, such as Miles Davis. In the middle of the 20th century, jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres, beginning with bebop. Bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody, and use of the <b>flatted</b> fifth. Bebop was developed in the early and mid-1940s, later evolving into styles like hard bop and free jazz. Innovators of the style included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who arose from small jazz clubs in New York City.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift from}} the bass bridge to the treble bridge is {{required}} because the bass bridge's fourth string G {{is the start of}} the lower tetrachord of the G scale. The player could go on up a couple notes (G - A - B), but the next note will be a <b>flatted</b> seventh (C natural in this case), because this note is drawn from the G tetrachord. This D major scale with a <b>flatted</b> seventh is the mixolydian mode in D.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{the church}} and its old {{building}} and additions, could not withstand the destructive powers of dynamite, bulldozers and military might of the Saddam Hussein's regime. The church was <b>flatted.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{proposals}} {{included an}} eight-storey <b>flatted</b> factory and 16 workshops with car parking above {{them as well}} as a new Assay Office, School of Jewellery, exhibition hall, restaurant, office block and shop. The <b>flatted</b> factory, known as the Hockley Centre (now the Big Peg), was completed in 1971. The workshops with the car parking space was completed in 1978 to the north of this. The scheme was not a success as there were complaints over the higher rent prices and many of the 150 firms that were displaced by the development moved elsewhere in the Quarter. As a result, the council abandoned the plan to progress further with the development and said {{there would be no more}} large scale redevelopment in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} {{has continued to}} decline although has remained throughout the postwar years. This has been a result of lack of demand combined with foreign competition. In 1965, 8,000 people were employed in 900 firms but by 1985, this had reduced to 4,000 people in 600 firms. The average life of a firm in the 1980s was 2.8 years which meant that the leasing of space in <b>flatted</b> factories was impractical. A report by consultants Segal Quince Wickstead noted that since 1981, the council had provided {{a lot of support}} for businesses in the area and improved the environment.|$|E
25|$|Ozenfant and Jeanneret {{felt that}} Cubism {{had become too}} decorative, practiced by so many {{individuals}} that it lacked unity, it had become too fashionable. Their clarity of subject matter (more figurative, less abstract than the Cubists) had been welcomed {{by members of the}} anti-Cubist camp. They showed works that were a direct result of observation; perspectival space only slightly distorted. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, like Lhote, remained faithful to the Cubist idiom that form should not be abandoned. Some of the works exhibited related directly to the Cubism practiced during the war (such as Ozenfant's Bottle, Pipe and Books, 1918), with <b>flatted</b> planar structures and varying degrees of multiple perspective.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Birmingham Jewellers' and Silversmiths' Association {{created a}} {{committee}} to discuss the regeneration of the industry in the Quarter. As many of the buildings were considered inappropriate for use, it was proposed by the BJSA in 1945 for the redevelopment of the area into <b>flatted</b> factories. Despite being accepted, the plan was not implemented. Following the war, the Quarter witnessed a slight recovery which was again hindered {{by the lack of}} space. In 1948, it was reported that the larger factories on the northern fringe of the Quarter were experiencing a decline in manufacturing whilst those in the centre were witnessing the opposite. Larger firms moved out of the area in the 1950s and 1960s to new sites elsewhere in the city. Some development did take place, such as the clearing of court housing around Pope Street, Carver Street and Camden Street.|$|E
25|$|The current {{terminal}} {{opened in}} 1988, was also designed by Halfdan Grieg and cost NOK250 million. This was {{followed up with}} a new control tower which opened in 1991. It had a limited height because of restrictions caused by the military designation of the main parallel taxiway as an emergency runway. By the mid-1980s there were 35 to 40 daily offshore helicopter flights out of Flesland each day. This was causing a press on the runway's capacity as the helicopters had to cross the runway to reach the North Sea. As estimates showed up to 60 flights per day, the airport started working on plans for a separate helicopter terminal, which would have been located southwest of the old main terminal and would have its own helicopter runway. Instead the traffic <b>flatted</b> out and the old main terminal was converted to a helicopter terminal. Braathens Helikopter established a base with two helicopters at Flesland in 1990. Within two years it had secured a thirty-percent market share of the offshore traffic. However, the airline was taken over by Helikopter Service in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Hone {{arrived to}} the clinic in May 1992 {{following}} a stint in Guatemala and instantly clashed with several of the staff due to his unorthodox methods. Hone's fianc√© Claire Lloyd (Annie Stanford) soon arrived but the couple broke up when it turned out she had been sleeping with both Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins). Hone grew close to co-worker Meredith Fleming's (Stephanie Wilkin) son Andrew (Ezra Woods) and became a father figure to him, eventually drawing him into a relationship with Meredith. In 1993 Meredith dumped Hone after several months and he <b>flatted</b> with Jenny (Maggie Harper) and Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) and later, Chris Warner. Following an appearance on a current affairs show, Hone began to be harassed by an unseen assailant. Hone soon discovered it was a fellow doctor, Te Aniwa Ryan (Moana Maniapoto-Jackson) who disagreed with his medical views. Nonetheless, the two overcame their issues and became a couple. In 1994 Hone cheated on Te Aniwa with Hillary (Susan Brady), ending his relationship for an affair that was short lived.|$|E
500|$|The pilots {{had several}} {{non-compliances}} to regulations in their descent. This included using [...] "Torghatten" [...] during the captain's briefing, despite no marking {{on the map}} using this name, nor one being located close to the mountain. The aircraft {{was supposed to have}} <b>flatted</b> out at 750meters (2,500ft), but instead this took place at 500meters (1,500ft). The next descent was started at [...] instead of [...] from the airport and the aircraft thus came under permitted altitude.|$|E
500|$|Instead, on the B note {{is another}} {{dominant}} seventh. [...] Such chords {{are the basis}} of the twelve-bar blues, and are used in this way to give [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] a bluesy, rock-'n'-roll feel, the chord change is manipulated to emphasize the B's <b>flatted</b> seventh (a minor third from the tonic), giving the song a sulky mood. This chord change is used for the intro, verse, chorus and the instrumental sections, with exception to the pre-chorus, which is in the relative key of D minor. [...] Overall, even regardless of the chord progression, the song seems to fall somewhere between major and minor, and the use of four-note seventh chords (as opposed to [...] "three-note" [...] chords) help to form a rich atmosphere. [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] is mainly carried by this arrangement, along with drum beats, sampled from [...] "Train In Vain".|$|E
2500|$|A seventh chord is a triad with {{an added}} note, which {{is either a}} major seventh above the root, a minor seventh above the root (<b>flatted</b> 7th), or a diminished seventh above the root (double <b>flatted</b> 7th). Note that the diminished seventh note is enharmonically {{equivalent}} to the major sixth above {{the root of the}} chord. When not otherwise specified, the name [...] "seventh chord" [...] may more specifically refer to a major triad with an added minor seventh (a dominant seventh chord).|$|E
2500|$|The blues' 12-bar {{structure}} and the blues scale was {{a major influence on}} rock and roll music. Rock and roll has been called [...] "blues with a backbeat"; Carl Perkins called rockabilly [...] "blues with a country beat". Rockabillies were also said to be 12-bar blues played with a bluegrass beat. [...] "Hound Dog", with its unmodified 12-bar structure (in both harmony and lyrics) and a melody centered on <b>flatted</b> third of the tonic (and <b>flatted</b> seventh of the subdominant), is a blues song transformed into a rock and roll song. Jerry Lee Lewis's style of rock and roll was heavily influenced by the blues and its derivative boogie woogie. His style of music was not exactly rockabilly but it has been often called real rock and roll (this is a label he shares with several African American rock and roll performers).|$|E

2500|$|Another local {{landmark}} is the Big Peg, formerly {{called the}} Hockley Centre. It {{was completed in}} 1971 as an eight storey <b>flatted</b> factory to a design by Peter Hing & Jones.

2500|$|The {{asymmetric}} loop between helical sections 8a and 8b and {{the adjacent}} base paired 8b section are a prominent property of every SRP RNA. Helical section 8b contains non-Watson-Crick base pairings which {{contribute to the}} formation of a <b>flatted</b> minor groove in the RNA suitable for the binding of protein SRP54 (called Ffh in the bacteria). The [...] loop of helix 8 contains four, five, or six residues, depending on the species. It has a highly conserved guanosine as the first and an adenosine as the last loop residue. This feature is required for the interaction with the third adenosine residue of the helix 6 GNAR tetraloop motif.|$|E
2500|$|The term blues {{may have}} come from [...] "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in George Colman's one-act farce Blue Devils (1798). The phrase blue devils may also have been derived from Britain in the 1600s, when the term {{referred}} to the [...] "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe alcohol withdrawal". [...] As time went on, the phrase lost the reference to devils, and [...] "it came to mean a state of agitation or depression." [...] By the 1800s in the United States, the term blues was associated with drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase blue law, which prohibits the sale of alcohol on Sunday. Though the use of the phrase in African-American music may be older, it has been attested to in print since 1912, when Hart Wand's [...] "Dallas Blues" [...] became the first copyrighted blues composition. In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood. Some sources state that the term blues is related to [...] "blue notes", the <b>flatted,</b> often microtonal notes used in blues, but the Oxford English Dictionary claims that the term blues came first and led to the naming of [...] "blue notes".|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie did {{not serve}} in World War II. At his Selective Service interview, he told the local board, [...] "in this stage of my life here in the United States whose foot has been in my ass?" [...] He was {{thereafter}} classed as 4-F. In 1943, Gillespie joined the Earl Hines band. Composer Gunther Schuller said:" ... In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it {{and all those other}} great musicians. They were playing all the <b>flatted</b> fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings." [...] Gillespie said of the Hines band, [...] "eople talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here ... naturally each age has got its own shit".|$|E
2500|$|The monastery {{consists}} of two cloisters. The Claustro Chico or small cloister is of simple architecture, constructed in stone with a cross in the center which has an anagram of Jesus' name. The Claustro Grande or large cloister (also called the Naranjo or Orange Tree cloister) has a more elaborate Plateresque design with [...] "Isabelino" [...] type columns. The small cloister may date from the Franciscan period or might {{be part of the}} early Augustinian church. <b>Flatted</b> arches on piers with a barrel-vaulted corridor on the ground level and a wood-roofed second level suggest the simple construction of the very early colonial period. Primitive frescos decorate the walls. The stone cross here is very similar to the Franciscan cross at one of the earliest monasteries in Cuernavaca. The crucifixion fresco on the second level is inspired by various European sources of the 15th and 16th centuries such as German prints, Italian and German ornamental panels. Starkly done in black and white, it reflects the continuing importance of the graphic arts. It also has sun and moon designs, common during the early colonial period, which reflect both old European astrological symbols as well as the importance of these in native art. In the larger, more ornate, cloister, there are medallions with images such as the coat of arms of the Augustine order, a symbol for death, and a symbol representing the union of two worlds. The lower floor has a series of stone etchings with scenes related to the Passion of Christ.|$|E
2500|$|As he {{had been}} in his two seasons with , Haussler was active in the Tour of Qatar in February. After {{finishing}} second to Tom Boonen in stage 1, Haussler won stage 2, outkicking Daniele Bennati at the finish, and moved within one second of Boonen in the overall classification. Though he had won the event's points classification {{in each of the last}} two years, this was Haussler's first ever stage win at the Tour of Qatar. In stage 3, Boonen <b>flatted</b> at a critical moment when the peloton was at its top speed and lost three minutes, leaving the top of the overall standings wide open. Haussler picked up a second consecutive stage win in Mesaieed, and in so doing he also moved into the overall race leadership. He credited the win to the team treating the third stage like a one-day classic, while also mentioning that 's Bernhard Eisel performed an effective leadout for all the sprinters at the finish. Haussler lost the overall lead in stage 4, as 's Mark Renshaw took the stage win and opened a six-second gap with his time bonus at the finish. Haussler was a distant ninth in the event's final stage, meaning the bonus time on offer went wanting and he finished second overall, though winning the points classification for the third year in a row. Similarly continuing 's legacy, the squad won the teams classification as their antecedents also had in each of the previous two editions. Haussler stated that he was pleasantly surprised by his early-season form and hoped it would portend for Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and the Tour of Flanders. At Paris‚ÄìNice in March, Haussler won the points classification without winning any stage. He had stage finishes in every position from second through fifth, however. At the concurrent Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico, Farrar won the first road race stage after an effective leadout from Hushovd. The next stage was also flat, and Hushovd again performed a leadout that was strong in form, but it was perhaps too strong this time. The world champion opened up a slight gap on Farrar in the final kilometer, and left him to sprint for the line from [...] out. Farrar lost out at the last moment to 's Juan Jos√© Haedo.|$|E

60|$|Weatherbee <b>flatted</b> {{every third}} note and sang such songs as 'The Boston Burglar' and 'the Handsome Cabin Boy,' {{for hours at}} a time, while Cuthfert wept with rage, till he could stand it no longer and fled into the outer cold. But there was no escape. The intense frost could not be endured for long at a time, and the little cabin crowded them--beds, stove, table, and all--into a space of ten by twelve. The very {{presence}} of either became a personal affront to the other, and they lapsed into sullen silences which increased in length and strength as the days went by. Occasionally, the flash of an eye or the curl of a lip got the better of them, though they strove to wholly ignore each other during these mute periods.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the cause}} why all these {{included}} Fluids, newly mentioned, or as many others as are wholly included within a heterogeneous fluid, {{are not exactly}} of a Spherical Figure (seeing that if caused by these Principles only, it could be of no other) must proceed from {{some other kind of}} pressure against the two opposite <b>flatted</b> sides. This adventitious or accidental pressure may proceed from divers causes, and accordingly must diversifie the Figure of the included heterogeneous fluid: For seeing that a body may be included either with a fluid only, or only with a solid, or partly with a fluid, and partly with a solid, or partly with one fluid, and partly with another; there will be found a very great variety of the terminating surfaces, much differing from a Spherical, according to the various resistance or pressure that belongs to each of these encompassing bodies.|$|E
60|$|And the First is an Observation that is {{very obvious}} even in these very drops, to wit, {{that they are all}} of them {{terminated}} with an unequal or irregular Surface, especially about the smaller part of the drop, and the whole length of the stem; as about D, and from thence to A, the whole Surface, which would have been round if the drop had cool'd leisurely, is, by being quenched hastily, very irregularly <b>flatted</b> and pitted; which I suppose proceeds partly from the Waters unequally cooling and pressing the parts of the drop, and partly from the self-contracting or subsiding quality of the substance of the Glass: For the vehemency of the heat of the drop causes such hidden motions and bubbles in the cold Water, that some parts of the Water bear more forcibly against one part then against another, and consequently do more suddenly cool those parts to which they are contiguous.|$|E
6000|$|The Cape became {{narrower}} and narrower as {{we approached}} its wrist between Truro and Provincetown, and the shore inclined more decidedly to the west. At the head of East Harbor Creek, the Atlantic is separated but by half a dozen rods of sand from the tide-waters of the Bay. From the Clay Pounds the bank <b>flatted</b> off {{for the last ten}} miles to the extremity at Race Point, though the highest parts, which are called [...] "islands" [...] from their appearance at a distance on the sea, were still seventy or eighty feet above the Atlantic, and afforded {{a good view of the}} latter, as well as a constant view of the Bay, there being no trees nor a hill sufficient to interrupt it. Also the sands began to invade the land more and more, until finally they had entire possession from sea to sea, at the narrowest part. For three or four miles between Truro and Provincetown there were no inhabitants from shore to shore, and there were but three or four houses for twice that distance.|$|E
60|$|This {{trembling}} {{and shaking}} of the Rays, is more sensibly caus'd by an actual flame, or quick fire, {{or anything else}} heated glowing hot; as by a Candle, live Coal, red-hot Iron, {{or a piece of}} Silver, and the like: the same also appears very conspicuous, if you look at an Object betwixt which and your eye, the rising smoak of some Chimney is interpos'd; which brings into my mind what I had once the opportunity to observe, which was, the Sun rising to my eye just over a Chimney that sent forth a copious steam of smoak; and taking a short Telescope, which I had then by me, I observ'd the body of the Sun, though it was but just peep'd above the Horizon, to have its underside, not onely <b>flatted,</b> and press'd inward, as it usually is when neer the Earth; but to appear more protuberant downwards then if it had suffered no refraction at all; and besides all this, the whole body of the Sun appear'd to tremble or dance, and the edges or limb to be very ragged or indented, undulating or waving, much {{in the manner of a}} flag in the Wind.|$|E
60|$|The Figure and bigness {{of these}} {{for the most}} part was the same with that of the Figure Z; that is, all the surface of them was very smooth and polisht, and {{for the most part}} round, but very rugged or knobbed about D, and all the length of the stem was here and there pitted or <b>flatted.</b> About D, which is at the upper part of the drop under that side of the stem which is concave, there usually was made some one or more little Hillocks or Prominences. The drop it self, before it be broken, appears very transparent, and towards the middle of it, to be very full of small Bubbles, of some kind of aerial substance, which by the {{refraction}} of the outward surface appear much bigger then really they are, and this may be in good part removed, by putting the drop under the surface of clear Water, for by that means most part of the refraction of the convex Surface of the drop is destroyed, and the bubbles will appear much smaller. And this, by the by, minds me of the appearing magnitude of the aperture of the iris, or pupil of the eye, which though it appear, and be therefore judged very large, is yet not above a quarter of the bigness it appears of, by the lenticular refraction of the Cornea.|$|E
60|$|The Light {{which comes}} through drops of Rain by two Refractions without any Reflexion, ought to appear strongest at the {{distance}} of about 26 Degrees from the Sun, and to decay gradually both ways as the distance from him increases and decreases. And the same is to be understood of Light transmitted through spherical Hail-stones. And if the Hail be a little <b>flatted,</b> as it often is, the Light transmitted may grow so strong at a little less distance than that of 26 Degrees, as to form a Halo about the Sun or Moon; which Halo, as often as the Hail-stones are duly figured may be colour'd, and then it must be red within by the least refrangible Rays, and blue without by the most refrangible ones, especially if the Hail-stones have opake Globules of Snow in their center to intercept the Light within the Halo (as Hugenius has observ'd) and make the inside thereof more distinctly defined than it would otherwise be. For such Hail-stones, though spherical, by terminating the Light by the Snow, may make a Halo red within and colourless without, and darker in the red than without, as Halos used to be. For of those Rays which pass close by the Snow the Rubriform will be least refracted, and so come to the Eye in the directest Lines.|$|E
