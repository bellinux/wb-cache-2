50|$|Foils are {{multilayered}} coatings that {{transfer to}} the surface of the product. Non-metallic foils consist of an adherence base, a color layer, and a release layer. Metallic foils replace the color layer with a layer of chrome or vacuum-metallized aluminum. Metallic foil construction has a metal-like sheen and is available in different metal shades such as gold, silver, bronze, and copper. Pigment foil does not have a metallic sheen but may be glossy or matte.

40|$|An {{important}} {{trend in}} electronics involves {{the development of}} materials, mechanical designs and manufacturing strategies that enable the use of unconventional substrates, such as polymer films, metal <b>foils,</b> <b>paper</b> sheets or rubber slabs. The last possibility is particularly challenging because the systems must accommodate not only bending but also stretching. Although several approaches are available for the electronics, a persistent difficulty is in power supplies that have similar mechanical properties, to allow their cointegration with the electronics. Here we introduce a set of materials and design concepts for a rechargeable lithium ion battery technology that exploits thin, low modulus silicone elastomers as substrates, with a segmented design in the active materials, and unusual “self-similar” interconnect structures between them. The result enables reversible levels of stretchability up to 300 %, while maintaining capacity densities of ~ 1. 1 mAh cm‑ 2. Stretchable wireless power transmission systems provide the means to charge these types of batteries, without direct physical contact...|$|R

40|$|The sealing {{properties}} of extrusion coating resins depend greatly on their extrusion history, e. g. {{the course of}} temperature, the pressure applied, the amount of shear stress {{and the extent of}} oxidation and degradation. In the research project under review, representative LDPE resins with melt indices of 4, 7 and 15 and a metallocene-catalysed LLDPE grade of melt index 14 were extrusion coated on aluminium <b>foil</b> and <b>paper</b> under the same conditions. The same melt temperature was used, the same screw back-pressure applied with ozone treatment firstly being carried out and then omitted. The sealing performance of the resins was evaluated by means of melt creep, melt flow and a new type of tack measurement of the pellets and pure polymer coatings in a rheometer. The results were then compared with the 'hot-tack' properties and the seal strength of these coatings on aluminium <b>foil</b> and <b>paper</b> substrates. Mechanisms to explain the distinct differences in sealing behaviour are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Inexpensive {{consumer}} electronics products, such as budget-priced Home theater {{in a box}} packages and low-cost boom boxes use lower quality passive crossovers. Expensive hi-fi speaker systems and receivers use higher quality passive crossovers, to obtain improved sound quality and lower distortion. The same price/quality approach is used with sound reinforcement system equipment and musical instrument amplifiers and speaker cabinets; a low-priced stage monitor, PA speaker or bass amplifier speaker cabinet will typically use lower quality, lower priced passive crossovers, whereas high-priced, high quality cabinets will use better quality crossovers. Passive crossovers may use capacitors made from polypropylene, metalized polyester <b>foil,</b> <b>paper</b> and electrolytic capacitors technology.

50|$|As {{with paper}} insulation, {{the control of}} {{electric}} stress fields remains important. Resin insulation has greater dielectric strength than paper and requires less stress control at voltages below 25 kV. However, some compact and higher rated switchgear designs, have earthed materials closer to bushings {{than in the past}} and these designs may require stress control screens in resin bushings operating as low as 12 kV Fixing points are often integral with the main resin form, and present fewer problems to earthed materials than the metal flanges used on paper bushings. However, care must be observed in resin insulated bushings designs which use internally cast screens such that the benefit of electrical stress field control is not off set by increasing partial discharge caused by the difficulties of eliminating micro voids in the resin around the screens during the casting process. The need to eliminate voids in resin becomes more sensitive as voltages increases, and it is normal to revert to resin impregnated, <b>foiled</b> <b>paper</b> insulation for bushings rated over 72.5 kV.|$|R
