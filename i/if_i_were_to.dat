5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> look back and see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> drink a {{quart of}} blood and, concealing what I had done, come to the {{emergency}} room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.|$|E

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, {{that it is a}} pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

500|$|Regarding his remix of the album, O'Brien stated, [...] "The band {{loved the}} {{original}} mix of Ten, but were {{also interested in}} what it would sound like <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> deconstruct and remix it...The original Ten sound is what millions of people bought, dug and loved, so I was initially hesitant to mess around with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound." ...|$|E

500|$|So {{has been}} {{described}} as Gabriel's most commercially accessible and least experimental album. Like his previous albums, its basis is in art rock, although on So, Gabriel develops an increased focus on melody and combines this with elements of soul and African music. [...] "With a song like (the previous album's) 'The Rhythm of the Heat' or 'The Family and the Fishing Net', <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> strum that along on a guitar or piano, the song might not work very well... whereas more of the things on this album do work just as lyric, melody and chords in a more traditional sense." ...|$|E
500|$|HaeB {{resigned}} as editor {{after he was}} hired by the Wikimedia Foundation in July 2011: [...] "It would make it too much of a conflict of interest <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> continue to make final editorial decisions for a community-run publication." [...] After three interim editors-in-chief, Wikipedia user The ed17 took over in May 2012 as The Signpost eighth editor. He previously edited The Bugle, the publication of the WikiProject dedicated to improving the encyclopedia's military history articles. The International Business Times noted in a 2013 article that The Signpost investigative journalism uncovered a link between the Wiki-PR firm and conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia.|$|E

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard.

500|$|... "Beat It" [...] was {{composed}} by Michael Jackson for his Thriller album. Producer Quincy Jones {{had wanted to}} include a rock and roll song in the vein of the Knack's [...] "My Sharona", though Jackson reportedly had never previously shown {{an interest in the}} genre. Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "I wanted to write a song, the type of song that I would buy <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> buy a rock song... That is how I approached it and I wanted the children to really enjoy it—the school children as well as the college students." [...] Jermaine Jackson has suggested the inspiration of [...] "Beat It" [...] and its video came from the Jackson family experiencing gang activity in Gary, Indiana.

500|$|Bond 25 began {{development}} in early 2016; Mendes stated {{he would not}} be the film's director. In October 2016, Craig stated that he may indeed return for another film, saying, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world. I'll keep doing it as long as I still {{get a kick out of}} it. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> stop doing it, I would miss it terribly." [...] Sony Pictures's contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to release Bond 25 in cinemas were put up for negotiation, with MGM and Eon only offering a one-film contract. In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen....

I think <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
