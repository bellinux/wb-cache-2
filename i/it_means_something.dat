500|$|The team {{colors are}} red, black and white, {{and they can}} be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003, is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The {{shoulders}} are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the 1992–93 season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping, leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as [...] "Christmas colors." [...] The Devils have yet to introduce a third jersey and are one of only two NHL teams (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one. Lamoriello had stated that he did not ever intend to introduce a third jersey for the Devils, saying, [...] "I don't believe in it", Lamoriello said. [...] "I strongly believe {{that you have to have}} one identity as a team. We want to create a feeling that our home and away jerseys are special and that <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>something</b> special to wear one." [...] Unlike most teams, the Devils kept the same uniform design when the NHL switched to the [...] jerseys by Reebok for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
500|$|Cindy begins helping Darren plan {{his wedding}} to girlfriend Nancy. Waring felt Cindy's {{feelings}} had been [...] "reawakened" [...] through this storyline, adding {{that they never}} [...] "fully went away". Waring opined that Darren asking Cindy to help plan his wedding made her feel [...] "needed and wanted". Waring felt that Cindy does not plan to split Darren and Nancy up but that there is [...] "a little part of [...] that thinks, 'Surely he's going to choose me?" [...] Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks [...] "that it should be her". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is [...] "the worst possible thing she could have done, because she thinks <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>something</b> but Darren thinks otherwise". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy {{she will have to}} let him go leaves her [...] "devastated". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says [...] "that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it". Dawson felt that Darren's relationship with Cindy was [...] "just sex", adding that [...] "it was more of a raw attraction rather than something that would work well in the long-term". Dawson added that it was good to revisit the relationship as the pair have been through a lot together. He added that since his relationship with Cindy [...] "Darren has matured ... Their recent goodbye scene was a great one to bring a bit of closure to what they had".|$|E

2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year. [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>something</b> different to me {{than it does to}} y'all..." [...] he responded. He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may. I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it." [...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2000, Stern's last live {{radio show}} of the year, he {{announced}} the signing of his new contract with Infinity Broadcasting to continue his show for five years after four months of negotiations. Forbes estimated his new earnings ranged between $17 million and $20 million a year. Stern spoke at The Concert for New York City in October 2001 in a hazmat suit with his buttocks exposed {{in a similar fashion}} to his 1992 MTV Music Video Awards appearance. In November 2001, Stern's production company had begun development on a weekly television sitcom titled Kane for CBS, originally intended to replace The Howard Stern Radio Show following its cancellation, with Ron Zimmerman as the writer of its pilot episode. Its premise followed [...] "an oddball southern family and its strong-willed patriarch. The lead character's life is altered when his previously long-lost wife returns home to him and their group of eccentric children". The project was cancelled before the filming stage. In late 2002, Stern acquired the rights to the comedy films Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) and Porky's (1982) with Arclight Films. He expressed a wish to use a remake of the former as a launchpad for an unknown band. Under the deal, Stern was served as executive producer and was allowed to place [...] "Howard Stern Presents" [...] in the titles. He reasoned, [...] "If I say to ... my audience, this is 'Howard Stern Presents', <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>something</b> to them ... it's going to be crazy. It means that it's going to be different, and they know I'm not going to be giving them any schlock." [...] Development for Porky's came to a halt in 2011 following legal action regarding the ownership of the film's rights.|$|E

In a sense our age has realised this fact, and expressed it in our sullen costume. For if it were really true that white was a blank and colourless thing, negative and non-committal, then white would be used instead of black and grey for the funeral dress of this pessimistic period.
