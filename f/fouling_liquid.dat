5000|$|Horizontal falling film {{evaporators}} have {{a number}} of potential advantages over their vertical counterparts in the petrochemical industry, such as the ability to use tubes with external enhancements. ( [...] Internally enhanced tubes are available for vertical falling film evaporators, but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling film evaporators is that if a corrosive or <b>fouling</b> <b>liquid</b> is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on the shell side. This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the testing of a statistical, rule-based fault detection and diagnostic method on a rooftop air conditioning unit. When faults occur in the unit, the measured thermodynamic states differ from the states which are predicted by a model for normal system behavior, generating residuals. The magnitude and statistical uncertainty of the residuals determine the detection sensitivity of the technique. The directional changes in the residuals are statistically compared with a set of rules in order to diagnose a fault. By experimentally introducing faults to the air conditioning unit at five different operating conditions and recording the changes in output states, the detection sensitivity of the technique was quantified and the robustness of the diagnostic rules was verified. Results show that the technique is able to reliably detect refrigerant leakage, condenser fouling, evaporator <b>fouling,</b> <b>liquid</b> line restriction, and compressor valve leakage over a wide range of operating conditions, before a significant decrease in the capacity and COP has occurred. However, the sensitivity of the technique is influenced by the operating conditions of the unit. 2...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} set-up {{was built to}} study heat transfer fouling of different pipe materials used in heat exchangers. Fouling mitigation investigations using wood pulp fibres in suspension in the <b>fouling</b> <b>liquid</b> were also performed. The new set-up allows progressive visual observation of fouling with time together with a recorded history under the same solution conditions. On completion, the tube under investigation could be removed to obtain quantitative data on the progressive build up of the deposit {{as well as the}} composition of the deposit. The experimental technique involved a pipe test specimen being centrally located in a cylindrical tank concentric with a vertical agitator to give constant and uniform flow conditions near the tube surface. The investigation of calcium sulphate deposition on four different metal surfaces (copper, aluminium, brass and stainless steel SS 316 respectively) and a polycarbonate surface reveals that the fouling increases with time but at a decreasing rate. The deposition on a metal surface can be seen to increase with increasing thermal conductivity and decreasing total surface energy over the range of experiments. Low surface energy material such as polycarbonate causes less attraction to the floating crystals and receives less deposition in comparison to the SS surface. Bleached Kraft softwood fibres at various concentrations were added to the solution to examine their effects on fouling. The results indicate that fouling is reduced as fibre concentration increases. It was also found that the fouling on stainless steel, brass and copper surfaces were all retarded in presence of fibre in the solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{techniques for}} automated detection, diagnostics, {{and evaluation of}} faults in vapor compression equipment. Fault evaluation {{was added to the}} more common steps of fault detection and diagnostics to consider the special aspects of performance degradation faults over abrupt faults. A model for testing these techniques in a simulation environment was developed. The model is described and experimental validation results are presented in this thesis. The model has a modular design that enables easy adaptation to different equipment configurations. It can be easily tuned with a few simple measurements and can simulate faults in the cycle. ^ The fault detection technique described in this thesis evaluates the impact of measurement errors on the confidence that current measurements are different from the predictions of a normal performance model. If the statistical confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold, then a fault is indicated. Diagnostics are performed by statistically evaluating a generic set of rules indicating the direction change of each measurement. This diagnostic technique does not require a learning phase for each piece of equipment, is capable of detecting a 5 % refrigerant leak, and can distinguish between refrigerant leaks, condenser fouling, evaporator <b>fouling,</b> <b>liquid</b> line restrictions, and compressor valve leakage. ^ Four fault impact evaluation criteria were developed to determine if the fault is severe enough to justify the service cost. These criteria are: comfort, economics, safety, and environmental hazard. Evaluating these criteria evolved into a constrained optimization problem to minimize lifetime service and energy costs while maintaining the other criteria as constraints. This problem was solved exactly using dynamic programming to create a minimum cost baseline for comparison with a simplified near-optimal scheduler, regular interval maintenance, and comfort constrained only maintenance. It was found that optimal service scheduling reduced lifetime operating costs by as much as a factor of two over regular service intervals and 50 % when compared to constrained only service. The near-optimal algorithm gave operating costs that were within 1 % of the optimal results. ...|$|E

Of course heat exchanger is most significant component for chemical reaction, distillation, dissolution, crystallization, fermentation etc. So the correct selection of heat exchanger {{is important in}} these process industries. Spiral Heat Exchangers are known as excellent heat exchanger because of compact structure and high heat transfer efficiency.

50|$|Megacopta cribraria, {{also called}} the bean plataspid, kudzu bug, kudzu beetle, {{globular}} stink bug and lablab bug, is a shield bug native to India and China, where it is an agricultural pest of lablab beans and other legumes. The bug, while harmless to houseplants and people, often enters houses. It is attracted to white surfaces such as the walls of houses or white vehicles, {{because of the high}} reflectance of the white surfaces {{as it relates to the}} bugs' simple eyes. As a defense mechanism, they emit a foul-smelling pheromone that also acts as a congregation pheromone. Aside from smelling <b>foul,</b> the <b>liquid</b> also creates a burning sensation and sometimes leaves a red welt on bare skin. It is similar to other Plataspididae in having a somewhat unusual symbiotic relationship with its gut bacteria. Before laying eggs, females deposit particles containing the symbiont, which are then eaten by newly hatched nymphs under natural conditions. Nymphs experimentally deprived of access to the symbiont exhibited slower growth, smaller body sizes and higher mortality.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The use of ion {{exchange}} resins in the polymerization of a c 4 -mixture to liquid fuels {{has shown that the}} catalyst is highly active, deactivates at a slow rate and selectively produces mainly dimers. Macropore diffusion resistance strongly influences the overall rate of the reaction. An increase in liquid production rate is obtained with increasing macroporosity, increasing degree of functionalization and decreasing catalyst bead size. A minimum acid strength of pKA = - 2. 4 is required. The liquid production rate is increased by increasing the reaction temperature and weight hourly space velocity. Moreover, longer chain length product are obtained with increasing reaction temperature and at reaction conditions, which result in the complete conversion of monomers. Recycling liquid product reduces the liquid production and increases the production of trimer at the expense of dimer. At moderate reaction temperatures {{ion exchange}} resins are regenerable but the activity of the catalyst is destroyed at reaction temperatures greater than approximately 130 °C. Deactivation occurs parallel to the main reaction and is due to cationic <b>fouling.</b> The <b>liquid</b> product obtained is highly branched. The R. O.

40|$|The {{development}} of a non-destructive, real-time observation technique to detect and monitor <b>fouling</b> during <b>liquid</b> separation processes is of great importance to the {{development of}} strategies to improve operating conditions. In this study ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) was used to measure organic fouling, in real time, during ultrafiltration (UF) with polysulfone (PS) membranes. The feed solution was a paper-mill effluent, which contains breakdown products of lignin or lignosulphonate, from a wastewater treatment plant. An asymmetric, composite PS membrane can be detected by UTDR. Experimental results showed that the ultrasonic signal response can be used to monitor fouling-layer formation and growth on the membrane in real-time. Traditional flux measurements and analysis of the membrane surface by microscopy corroborated the UTDR results. Further, the differential signal developed indicate the state and progress of the fouling layer and gives warning of advanced fouling during operation. Moreover, a predictive modelling program — ultrasonic reflection (USRF) was developed to model the fouling deposits. This contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the fouling layer formation and its recognition during ultrasonic testing. This modelling was applied to model the density and thickness of a fouling layer on a membrane surface so as to predict the fouling behavior. The modelling results were in a good agreement with the actual observations...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{bioreactor}} (MBR) fouling is {{not only}} influenced by the soluble microbial products (SMP) concentration but by their characteristics. Experiments of separate producing biomass associated products (BAP) and utilization associated products (UAP) allowed the separation of BAP and UAP effects from sludge water (SW).

Unstirred cell filtration was used to study <b>fouling</b> mechanisms and <b>liquid</b> chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) were used to characterize the foulant. Generally, the SMP exhibiting characteristics of higher molecular weight, greater hydrophilicity and a more reduced state showed a higher retention percentage.

The UAP filtration showed the highest specific cake resistance and pore blocking resistance attributed to their higher percentage of low molecular weight molecules, although their retention percentage was lower than the SW and BAP filtration.

5000|$|Dottle can be {{produced}} by different factors. The primary cause of an excessive amount of dottle is a tightly packed or otherwise improperly packed pipe, where the tobacco has been improperly prepared or is compressed and will not burn properly. A second possible cause can be the excessive moisture content of the tobacco and the tobacco being smoked too quickly. This can result in tobacco that is too wet to burn. Rapid or hard draws on the pipe can and will produce an excessively hot ember in the bowl causing the moisture content of the tobacco to vaporize and then condense in bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole, preventing the tobacco from burning properly. A third contributor {{to the creation of}} dottle is propylene glycol or [...] "PG". This innocuous preservative used primarily in aromatic tobaccos can keep the moisture content high in pipe tobaccos even after drying.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Industrial Programs (OIP) {{sponsors}} {{the development}} of innovative heat exchange systems. Fouling is a major and persistent cost associated with most industrial heat exchangers and nationally wastes an estimated 2. 9 Quads per year. To predict and control fouling, three OIP projects are currently exploring heat exchanger fouling in specific industrial applications. A fouling probe has been developed to determine empirically the fouling potential of an industrial gas stream and to derive the fouling thermal resistance. The probe is a hollow metal cylinder capable of measuring the average heat flux {{along the length of}} the tube. The local heat flux is also measured by a heat flux meter embedded in the probe wall. The fouling probe has been successfully tested in the laboratory at flue gas temperatures up to 2200 ?F and a local heat flux up to 41, 000 BTU/hr-ft 2. The probe has been field tested at a coal-fired boiler plant. Future tests at a municipal waste incinerator are planned. Two other projects study enhanced heat exchanger tubes, specifically the effect of enhanced surface geometries on tube bundle performance. Both projects include <b>fouling</b> in a <b>liquid</b> heat transfer fluid.

40|$|Production of {{fuel grade}} ethanol from various {{lignocellulosic}} materials using enzymatic hydrolysis {{has been under}} development for some time now. Some of the individual steps such as pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation have been improved to a great extent. Much effort has also been put into making the process as such more efficient. This includes studies {{on the effect of}} recirculation of process streams to minimise fresh water consumption and effluent streams. However, one major technical obstacle is still to be met, especially in the SSF (simultaneous saccharification and fermentation) process: the separation of the solid residue from the liquid. This residue, which consists mainly of lignin and non-hydrolysed cellulose, tends to be extremely difficult to separate into a solid and a liquid fraction, since it is very sticky. In SSF yeast cells are also present, which complicates the separation. Common separation methods of these residues often result in a slow filtration rate. When a filter press is utilised an extremely compact filter cake is rapidly formed. Employment of a decanter centrifuge, on the other hand, is rapid but yields a solid phase having a low dry matter content. In this work, a rather new technology has also been studied. A vibrating membrane separation unit (VSEP) was used to separate material from SSF or SHF. Due to high shear forces the membrane surface is not easily <b>fouled,</b> but the <b>liquid</b> flux through the membrane is maintained at a high level.

40|$|Human space {{missions}} generate trash with {{a substantial}} amount of plastic (20 % or greater by mass). The trash also contains water trapped in food residue and paper products and other trash items. The Heat Melt Compactor (HMC) under development by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) compresses the waste, dries it to recover water and melts the plastic to encapsulate the compressed trash. The resulting waste disk or puck represents an approximately ten-fold reduction in the volume of the initial trash loaded into the HMC. In the current design concept being pursued, the trash is compressed by a piston after it is loaded into the trash chamber. The piston face, the side walls of the waste processing chamber and the end surface in contact with the waste can be heated to evaporate the water and to melt the plastic. Water is recovered by the HMC in two phases. The first is a pre-process compaction without heat or with the heaters initially turned on but before the waste heats up. Tests have shown that during this step some liquid water may be expelled from the chamber. This water is believed to be free water (i. e., not bound with or absorbed in other waste constituents) that is present in the trash. This phase is herein termed Phase A of the water recovery process. During HMC operations, it is desired that liquid water recovery in Phase A be eliminated or minimized so that water-vapor processing equipment (e. g., condensers) downstream of the HMC are not <b>fouled</b> by <b>liquid</b> water and its constituents (i. e., suspended or dissolved matter) exiting the HMC. The primary water recovery process takes place next where the trash is further compacted while the heated surfaces reach their set temperatures for this step. This step will be referred to herein as Phase B of the water recovery process. During this step the waste chamber may be exposed to different selected pressures such as ambient, low pressure (e. g., 0. 2 atm), or vacuum. The objective for this step is to remove both bound and any remaining free water in the trash by evaporation. The temperature settings of the heated surfaces are usually kept above the saturation temperature of water but below the melting temperature of the plastic in the waste during this step to avoid any encapsulation of wet trash which would reduce the amount of recovered water by blocking the vapor escape. In this paper, we analyze the water recovery rate during Phase B where the trash is heated and water leaves the waste chamber as vapor, for operation of the HMC in reduced gravity. We pursue a quasi-one-dimensional model with and without sidewall heating to determine the water recovery rate and the trash drying time. The influences of the trash thermal properties, the amount of water loading, and the distribution of the water in the trash on the water recovery rates are determined...|$|R
