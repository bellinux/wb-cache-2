Because of its small size, short <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was selected as a model organism for studies of the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, animal behaviour and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the fruit fly's important role in biological research. 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the Darwinian theory of evolution from a single origin of life.|$|E

40|$|The {{infection}} risk of biomaterials implants varies {{between different}} materials and {{is determined by}} an interplay of adhesion and surface growth of the infecting organisms. In this study, we compared initial adhesion and surface growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH 2 102 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK 1 on poly(dimethylsiloxane), Teflon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and glass. Initial adhesion was measured in situ in a parallel plate now chamber with microorganisms suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, while subsequent surface growth was followed in full and in 20 times diluted growth medium, initial adhesion of both bacterial strains was similar to all biomaterials in full growth medium, <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> of surface growing S. epidermidis ranged from 17 to 38 min with no relation to wettability, while in diluted growth medium <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> increased from 44 to 98 min with increasing surface wettability. For P. aeruginosa no influence of surface wettability on <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> was observed, but <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> increased with decreasing desorption rates, maximal <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> being 47 min and minimal values down to 30 min. Generally, <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> of adhering bacteria were shorter than of planktonic bacteria.

5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

25|$|Angiogenesis {{research}} is a cutting-edge field in cancer research, and recent evidence also suggests traditional therapies, such as radiation therapy, may actually work {{in part by}} targeting the genomically stable endothelial cell compartment, rather than the genomically unstable tumor cell compartment. New blood vessel formation is a relatively fragile process, subject to disruptive interference at several levels. In short, the therapy is the selection agent which {{is being used to}} kill a cell compartment. Tumor cells evolve resistance rapidly due to rapid <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> (days) and genomic instability (variation), whereas endothelial cells are a good target because of a long <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> (months) and genomic stability (low variation).|$|E

25|$|Embryogenesis in Drosophila {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied, as its small size, short <b>generation</b> <b>time,</b> and large brood size makes it ideal for genetic studies. It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a syncytium.|$|E
25|$|When {{researchers}} {{look for}} an organism to use in their studies, they look for several traits.

25|$|D. melanogaster is {{a popular}} {{experimental}} animal because it is easily cultured en masse out of the wild, has a short <b>generation</b> <b>time,</b> and mutant animals are readily obtainable. In 1906, Thomas Hunt Morgan began his work on D. melanogaster and reported his first finding of a 'white' (eyed) mutant in 1910 to the academic community. He was {{in search of a}} model organism to study genetic heredity and required a species that could randomly acquire genetic mutation that would visibly manifest as morphological changes in the adult animal. His work on Drosophila earned him the 1933 Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. This and other Drosophila species are widely used in studies of genetics, embryogenesis, and other areas.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{after the}} turnips, {{the earth was}} grown with rice plants. The first rice plants were without husk and kernels. The sweet and honey-like rice flourished seeds abundantly. The people {{consumed}} them {{for a very long}} time. But there are people who became greedy and lazy. They took more rice than they needed for one day's meals. They began to take two, four, eight, and sixteen days' of rice reserves as they were too lazy to take rice everyday. Owing to this, many other creatures began to store and hoard the rice. The <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> for rice plants became slower and slower. Usually, it took only one night for the plant to grow and be ready to be consumed, but by the karmic power the plant began to grow more and more slowly. Also the rice grew in kernels and husks, scattered, which the creatures must work, nurse, maintain, harvest, and cook in order to obtain the white rice.|$|E
25|$|Since neutrinos {{could not}} be {{accurately}} tracked to the specific protons producing them, an averaging method had to be used. The researchers added up the measured proton pulses to get an average distribution in time of the individual protons in a pulse. The time at which neutrinos were detected at Gran Sasso was plotted to produce another distribution. The two distributions were expected to have similar shapes, but be separated by 2.4milliseconds, {{the time it takes}} to travel the distance at light speed. The experimenters used an algorithm, maximum likelihood, to search for the time shift that best made the two distributions to coincide. The shift so calculated, the statistically measured neutrino arrival time, was approximately 60nanoseconds shorter than the 2.4milliseconds neutrinos would have taken if they traveled just at light speed. In a later experiment, the proton pulse width was shortened to 3nanoseconds, and this helped the scientists to narrow the <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> of each detected neutrino to that range.|$|E
5000|$|In this case, {{the faster}} rate of neutral {{evolution}} in proteins expected in small populations (due {{to a more}} lenient threshold for purging deleterious mutations) is offset by longer <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> (and vice versa), but in large populations with short <b>generation</b> <b>times,</b> noncoding DNA evolves faster while protein evolution is retarded by selection (which is more significant than drift for large populations) In 1973, Ohta published a short letter in Nature [...] suggesting that {{a wide variety of}} molecular evidence supported the theory that most mutation events at the molecular level are slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral.|$|R

50|$|This mode of {{selection}} {{is likely to}} occur in interactions between unicellular organisms and viruses due to large population sizes, short <b>generation</b> <b>times,</b> often haploid genomes and horizontal gene transfer, which increase the probability of beneficial mutations arising and spreading through populations.|$|R
25|$|Fynbos shrublands {{occur in}} a small belt across South Africa. The plant species in this {{ecosystem}} are highly diverse, yet {{the majority of these}} species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have coevolved into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils. Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid <b>generation</b> <b>time</b> that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid evolution and speciation in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.|$|E

Growth character-istics of B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. mycoides, and B. subtilis strains in brain heart infusion broth at pH 6. 5, 6. 0, and 5. 5 were determined by absorbance measurements. Growth curves of B. anthracis Sterne and B. cereus strains appeared similar, and the <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> for strain Sterne fell within the PMP’s 95 % confidence interval for B. cereus. However, the virulent B. anthracis strains Vollum and Pasteur had shorter <b>generation</b> <b>times</b> than the avirulent Sterne strain and most other surrogates and were lower than the PMP’s 95 % confidence interval for B. cereus.
