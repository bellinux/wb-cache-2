25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect upon our Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Moser {{published}} a second {{work in the}} Kleine Kryptogamenﬂora von Mitteleuropa series, Ascomyceten (Schlauchpilze). This work was a monograph on the Ascomycetes, focussing on the Discomycetes. Though not as well known as his earlier book, it was well received in the mycological community. The mycologist Richard Korf, reviewing the work {{in an article published}} in Mycologia, said that [...] "the book belongs on the shelf of every mycological library in Europe", praising the [...] "xcellent, workable keys to the orders, families, genera, and European species". Korf wrote that, [...] "f a single fault can be found, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> the lack of documentation provided". However, a combination of a lack of time and Moser's comparative lack of expertise in Ascomycetes prevented subsequent editions of the work.|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi employs {{specific}} musical {{devices to}} signify moods and situations. For example, triple metre signifies {{the language of}} love for Nerone and Ottone (unfulfilled in the latter case); forceful arpeggios are used to represent conflict; and the interlacing of texts, written as separate verses by Busenello, indicates sexual tension in the scenes with Nerone and Poppea, and escalates the discord between Nerone and Seneca. The technique of [...] "concitato genere"—rapid semiquavers sung on one note—is used to represent rage. Secret truths may be hinted at as, for example, when Seneca's friends plead with him to reconsider his suicide in a chromatic madrigal chorus which Monteverdi scholar Denis Arnold finds reminiscent of Monteverdi's Mantuan days, carrying a tragic power rarely seen in 17th century opera. This is followed, however, by a cheerful diatonic section by the same singers which, says Rosand, suggests a lack of real sympathy with Seneca's predicament. The descending tetrachord ostinato on which the final duet of the opera is built has been anticipated in the scene in which Nerone and Lucano celebrate Seneca's death, hinting at an ambivalence {{in the relationship between}} emperor and poet. According to Rosand: [...] "in both cases <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> the traditional association of that pattern with sexual love that is being evoked." ...|$|E

[...] "It seems significant that no male member of the Pallache family ever married a woman from the Portuguese community... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> significant that neither Samuel nor any of his heirs were ever to marry into the great trading families of 'the Portuguese nation'." [...] In September 2016, however, two 1643 marriage certificates were discovered for David Pallache (1598–1650) and Judith Lindo (???–October 30, 1665) of Antwerp, daughter of Ester Lindo [...] Death details for David Pallache also confirm the marriage. [...] Further, three years later, in 1646, Samuel Pallache (1616–???), son of Isaac Joseph Pallache and nephew of David Joseph Pallache, married Abigail (born 1622), sister of Judith Lindo.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, the Moscow edition was the {{standard}} text. In 1977, an early 1217 manuscript was rediscovered in Florence. The 1217 Florence manuscript {{is one of}} the earliest known copies of the Shahnameh, predating the Moghul invasion and the following destruction of important libraries and manuscript collections. Using it as the chief text, Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh began the preparation of a new critical edition in 1990. The number of manuscripts that were consulted during the preparation of Khaleghi-Motlagh edition goes beyond anything attempted by the Moscow team. The critical apparatus is extensive and a large number of variants for many parts of the poem were recorded. The last volume was published in 2008, bringing the eight-volume enterprise to a completion. According to Dick Davis, professor of Persian at Ohio State University, it is [...] "by far the best edition of the Shahnameh available, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> likely to remain such for a very long time".|$|E

2500|$|Photios {{continued}} {{his career as}} a writer throughout his exile, and Leo probably rehabilitated his reputation within the next few years; in his Epitaphios on his brothers, a text probably written in 888, the Emperor presents Photios favorably, portraying him as the legitimate archbishop, and the instrument of ultimate unity, an image that jars with his attitude to the patriarch in the previous year. Confirmation that Photios was rehabilitated comes upon his death: according to some chronicles, his body was permitted to be buried in Constantinople. In addition, according to the anti-Photian biographer of Ignatius, partisans of the ex-patriarch after his death endeavored to claim for him the [...] "honor of sainthood". Furthermore, a leading member of Leo's court, Leo Choirosphaktes, wrote poems commemorating the memory of several prominent contemporary figures, such as Leo the Mathematician and the Patriarch Stephen, and he also wrote one on Photios. Shaun Tougher notes, however, that [...] "yet Photios's passing does seem rather muted for a great figure of Byzantine history [...] Leo [...] certainly did not allow him back into the sphere of politics, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> his absence from this arena that accounts for his quiet passing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance {{stated in}} his 1897 Small Arms {{report to the}} Secretary of the Navy, [...] "In making what may appear a radical {{departure}} in its selection of a caliber smaller than as yet adopted elsewhere...the Bureau is convinced it is {{looking to the future}} … <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> wise to attempt to advance with one stride as far as existing conditions allow toward the goal to which the world is moving with slow steps." [...] The report went on to list the advantages of the smaller 6mm caliber: greatly increased velocity, flatness of bullet trajectory, reduced recoil, a 100% increase in penetration compared to the former [...]45-70 Government cartridge, and the ability to carry twice the number of cartridges per individual sailor or marine. The report acknowledged, however, that the 6mm round had two principal disadvantages: first, as a small-caliber round, the 6mm bullet would not sufficiently wound an enemy to put him out of action, and second, the [...] "shock" [...] or stopping power of the smaller bullet would not [...] "stop the onset of excited men at short range." [...] In answer to these objections, the report gave three responses: first, [...] "the battle of the future will be fought at long range, and men will not live to come to close quarters with an enemy who stands his ground"; second, [...] "99 percent of wounded enemy soldiers were unlikely to investigate the severity of their wound, but simply retire to the rear", and last, [...] "the explosive effect of a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet against the human body—the bullet tumbles or fragments to produce devastating wounds against bone or fluid-filled organs—would be more incapacitating at all ranges than wounds made by a slow-moving bullet of large caliber.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{failed to}} perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony's only means {{with which he}} might [...] "write himself into Rome's {{imperial}} narrative and position himself at the birth of empire" [...] is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; [...] "once [...] understands his failed virtus, his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate Dido". Antony and Cleopatra {{can be read as}} a rewrite of Virgil's epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: [...] "If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory of our past is Aeneas' rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the Roman Empire, than <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surely</b> significant that Shakespeare's ... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back {{for the sake of his}} African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas". Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of [...] "occupying the... politically empowering place" [...] of the female sacrificial victim. The abundant imagery concerning his person—"of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame"—informs the view of some critics that the Roman [...] "figures Antony's body as queer, that is, as an open male body... not only 'bends' in devotion' but... bends over". In reciprocal contrast, [...] "in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals". While Caesar's empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra's is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally—indeed, [...] "she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough'd her, and she cropp'd" [...] (2.2.232–233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that [...] "as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play's action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility". Caesar says of her final deed, [...] "Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way" [...] (5.2.325–327).|$|E
