40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether perceived popularity mediates and/or moderates {{the association between}} agentic goals and bullying, and whether sociometric popularity mediates and/or moderates the association between communal goals and bullying. Age and gender differences were also examined. Participants were 276 fourth and fifth graders (middle childhood sample) and 196 seventh and eighth graders (early adolescence sample). Peer status and bullying were assessed with sociometric measures, interpersonal <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> self-reports. The theoretical model included both mediation and moderation effects. An age-related reversal was found in how status mediated the associations between goals and bullying. Sociometric popularity mediated the association of agentic <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> bullying in middle childhood but of communal <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> bullying in early adolescence. Perceived popularity mediated the association of communal <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> bullying in middle childhood but of agentic <b>goals</b> <b>with</b> bullying in early adolescence. In middle childhood, perceived popularity also moderated the effect of agentic goals on bullying. The results were {{discussed in terms of}} the role of bullying as a means to enhance status in early adolescence...|$|R

5|$|For example, in {{the diagram}} on the right, after the natural but mistaken 10...0-0?! White can {{immediately}} realise his strategic <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> 11.c5! Then if Black accepts the temporary sacrifice after 11...Qxc5 12.Rc1 Qd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 14.Rd1 White gets his pawn back and {{has created a}} weak pawn in d7, while if Black declines the pawn he has difficulties in developing his queenside (for example 11...d6 might be followed by 12.cxd6 Qxd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 and the pawn on d6 is weak). Therefore Black generally tries to hinder the c4–c5 push with moves like d7–d6, b7–b6 or Rf8–d8 (if this creates a hidden vis-à-vis between the Rd8 and the Qd2).|$|E
