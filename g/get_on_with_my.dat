500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it {{was just a matter of}} a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" [...] and [...] "I might as well <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E

When addressing a town hall-style meeting in 2007, Dellums declared, [...] "I'm giving it everything that I have. If that's not enough, that's cool. Recall me and let me <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> private life." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Fromme {{pointed the}} gun at Ford, several people heard a [...] "metallic click" [...] sound. As the red-robed Fromme shouted, [...] "It wouldn't go off", Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf grabbed the gun, forced it from Fromme's hand, and {{brought her to the}} ground. On the ground, Fromme said, [...] "It didn't go off. Can you believe it? It didn't go off". One of the Secret Service agents shouted [...] "get down, let's go". Secret Service agents then half-dragged Ford away from Fromme towards the east {{entrance}} of the Capitol, until Ford yelled in protest, [...] "Put me down! Put me down!" [...] Ford continued his walk to the California state house, entered, and then met with California governor Jerry Brown at 10:06a.m. for 30minutes without mentioning the assassination attempt until they were through talking business. Ford, who later indicated that he was not scared, concluded, [...] "I thought I'd better <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> day's schedule".|$|E

2500|$|BBC chief Charlie Smith told The Sun on 11 October 2011 that David Haye had {{informed}} {{him that he would}} not be renewing his boxing licence, thus retiring from the sport. Haye has had a long-standing plan to retire early. After the Harrison fight Haye said his plans to retire before he is 31 had not altered: [...] "I will have achieved what I wanted to achieve – undisputed cruiserweight champion, unify the heavyweight division and then call it a day." [...] In December 2010, during the negotiations to fight Wladimir Klitschko, Haye said if the fight did not happen, [...] "I'll just have to accept that becoming the WBA champion was enough and move on with my life. That'll be 20 years of getting punched in the face, which is a long enough time. I set my goals and achieved them so unifying the titles is the cherry on the cake but if it doesn't happen it wasn't meant to be and I've just got to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> life".|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a ridiculous}} female {{character}} played by Tim Brooke-Taylor. Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement {{along the lines}} of [...] "what is that coming towards us? – It's huge – It's a rhinoceros!" [...] – [...] "No, it's me!!!" [...] and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again", and always by rousing cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the [...] "Henry VIII" [...] sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen. [...] Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: [...] "..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own – and there's enough to go round – twice -...". [...] In the [...] "Dentisti" [...] sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series Daktari, Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in [...] "Jack The Ripper", Lady Constance is invited to: [...] "please, sit down anywhere ... or in your case, everywhere". In the [...] "Radio Prune Greek Tragedy" [...] sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex – according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog – and [...] she tells Oedipus: [...] "Now let me <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> housework, I've got a little behind [...]." [...] (pause for the double-entendre to register) [...] ".. oh all right, I've got a colossal behind!!" [...] In the [...] "Colditz" [...] sketch, the lads' escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims [...] "She's like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!". She also in her own way {{is a bit of a}} nymphomaniac – she's described in the 25th anniversary show version of [...] "Jack The Ripper" [...] as a steaming volcano of eroticism – and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the [...] "3.17 to Cleethorpes" [...] sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, [...] "Yes, and then what?", Lady Constance replies, [...] "Well, that's rather up to you ...." ...|$|E

6000|$|Courthorne laughed. [...] "There's {{nothing to}} be gained by pretending to {{misunderstand}} you, but it wouldn't pay me to be resentful when I'm graciously willing to let you work for me. Still, I have been inclined to wonder how you were <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> estimable relatives and connections.

6000|$|I was disappointed, I was nervous, I {{wanted to}} <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> work; so I replied with irritation: [...] "Oh, my dear Major--I can't be ruined for YOU!" ...|$|E

6000|$|When, however, at luncheon, {{more than}} an hour later, I found that I was thirty {{pheasants}} behind my adversary, I shook my head, and so did everybody else. On the whole, that luncheon, of which we partook in a keeper's house, was a very pleasant meal, though Van Koop talked so continuously and in such a boastful strain that I saw it irritated our host {{and some of the other}} gentlemen, who were very pleasant people.

'Sit down,' she says; 'I've nothing to read, and I hate work; let's have a little chat.' She's got a glib tongue of her own. All I could do was to say a word now and then to keep her going. She talked and talked till it was time to light the lamp. She was particular in telling me to put the shade over it. We were half in the dark, and half in the light. She trapped me (Lord knows how!) into talking about foreign parts; I mean the place she lived in before they sent her to England. Have you heard that she comes from the West Indies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kitty {{shook her}} head. There was an {{objection}} to the old man. [...] "He asks questions; {{he wants to know}} how I <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> sums. He's proud of his summing; and he finds me out when I'm wrong. I don't like the lodge-keeper." ...|$|E
