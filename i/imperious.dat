5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's <b>imperious</b> personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E
5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, and the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an <b>imperious</b> manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E
5|$|Defeated Sanity {{was formed}} in Dachsbach, Germany in 1994 by guitarist Wolfgang Teske and drummer Lille Gruber, {{initially}} as a side project. In 1996, bassist Jonas Gruber and vocalist Robert Colnik joined the band as session musicians. This line-up recorded the first two demos, Devoured by the Black in the same year, followed by Withdrawn from Beauty in 1998. After undergoing a line-up change, Defeated Sanity eventually recruited guitarist Christian Müenzner and bassist Tino Köhler. Colnik departed the band shortly after recording a demo in 2000. He was replaced by Markus Keller, who re-recorded a track from the demo; the track was included on the split with Poppy Seed Grinder, released through the Czech label Grodhaisn in 2001. Later that year, Münzner left the band to join Necrophagist. Defeated Sanity released a 7-inch split EP with Brazilian death metal band <b>Imperious</b> Malevolence through Merciless Records in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Fresh {{from their}} {{successful}} 2010–11 season, City began the new league season in <b>imperious</b> form, breaking {{a number of}} Premier League records. City won their seven out of their eight league matches {{at the start of}} the season, with a 2–2 draw in between this run. The magnitude of the victories surprised many: 4–0 against Swansea City at home, 5–1 against Tottenham away, 4–0 against Blackburn away and 4–1 against Aston Villa at home.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka on {{the other}} hand were much happier. Their side had climbed to 3rd place in the ICC Test Match rankings, with England {{slipping}} from 2nd to 5th. Their two best batsmen were in <b>imperious</b> form, their newer players were improving by the game and their bowling attack was delivering as a unit. At the end of the series, the world’s top ranked test batsman and bowler were both Sri Lankan: Sangakkara and Muralitharan respectively.|$|E

25|$|Whitlam's {{radical and}} <b>imperious</b> style {{eventually}} alienated many voters, {{and some of}} the state governments were openly hostile to his government. As it did not control the senate, much of its legislation was rejected or amended. The Queensland Country Party government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen had particularly bad relations with the Federal government. Even after it was re-elected at elections in May 1974, the Senate remained an obstacle to its political agenda. At the only joint sitting of parliament, in August 1974, six keys pieces of legislation were passed.|$|E
25|$|Allan Border added 35, and Dean Jones made 27, but the {{highlight}} of the second day {{came in the form of}} Steve Waugh who continued his <b>imperious</b> form from the first test, driving square of the wicket masterfully. Although he was not as quick scoring in the first test, he moved onto 35 not out by the close, with Merv Hughes once again by his side not out on 2. Australia had ground out runs throughout a slow second day to end on 276 for 6, still ten runs behind England's first innings score.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of his reign, Pratapsinha also {{had to deal with the}} <b>imperious</b> {{attitude}} of Dost Ali, the Nawab of the Carnatic. Pratapsinha was soon deposed by Dost Ali who took over the administration of Thanjavur. But a Maratha invasion from the north brought about the death of Dost Ali and the restoration of Pratapsingh. The Maratha troops left after making one Murari Rao the ruler of Tiruchirapalli with whom Pratapsinha was in bad terms. Soon afterwards, the Nizam of Hyderabad sent a formidable force to Thanjavur to exact tribute. Two other expeditions forced the Raja into submission.|$|E
25|$|Northcote {{was still}} Governor of Bombay when the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, offered him {{the post of}} Governor-General of Australia in 1903. The first two Governors-General, Lord Hopetoun and Lord Tennyson, had served {{shortened}} terms and had had difficult relations with Australian ministers. Both the British and Australian governments wanted stability and continuity, and Northcote was appointed for a five-year term. His lifelong experience in politics and his time in Bombay made him a suitable appointment. He was neither as <b>imperious</b> as Hopetoun nor as stuffy as Tennyson, {{and he made a}} good impression with both politicians and the public.|$|E
25|$|She {{should have}} been a man – a great navigator. Her {{powerful}} reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong <b>imperious</b> will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.|$|E
25|$|For {{nearly a}} decade prior to 1903, an {{industrial}} union called the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) had been increasing in power, militancy, and radicalism in response to dangerous working conditions, the imposition of long hours of work, and what members perceived as an <b>imperious</b> attitude {{on the part of}} employers. In particular, members of the WFM had been outraged by employers' use of labor spies in organizing efforts such as Coeur d'Alene. The miners' frustrations had occasionally exploded in anger and violence, although they had also tried peaceful change. For example, after winning a referendum vote for the eight-hour day with support from 72 percent of Colorado's electorate, the WFM's goal of an eight-hour law was still defeated by employers and politicians.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{remarriage}} rejuvenated {{his personal}} aspirations for re-election. Edith Wilson enjoyed, as Ellen never had, {{the crowds and}} the power as a close collaborator with her husband. Executive decisions {{just prior to the}} campaign also enabled Wilson to bolster his political mastery. He was presented with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, which he succeeded in filling with a controversial nominee, Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the court. Also, in the summer of 1916 the nation's economy was endangered by a railroad strike. The president called the parties to a White House summit in August—after two days and no results, Wilson proceeded to settle the issue, using the maximum eight-hour work day as the linchpin. Once the Congress passed the Adamson bill incorporating the president's proposal, the strike was cancelled. Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster, though the law was received with howls from conservatives denouncing a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an <b>imperious</b> president.|$|E
25|$|Our {{authorities}} speak {{very little}} of his character. An inference may, however, be drawn {{on the basis of}} his performance. Ambitious, bold and rapacious, Churaman was cunning to an unusual degree. Certain traits of his character suggest that as a person he was complex. His movements after the murder of Husain Ali reflect his coolness and foresight, but the case of his suicide reveals his sense of devotion and gratitude. At the same time his conduct in the wars of succession generally testifies to his being unscrupulous and deceitful. Similarly, while his treatment and <b>imperious</b> disposition, the way he held back in face of extreme provocation from his eldest son, Muhkam Singh, speaks of his occasional resignation and self-restraint. Churaman displayed a passionate love for money and plunder throughout his life. Examples of occasional loot were not wanting among the Jats either before or after him. But no other Jat leader of his caliber had ever given himself to plunder to this extent.|$|E
25|$|The longstanding estate {{battle of}} Jarndyce v Jarndyce {{hangs over the}} heads of many {{conflicting}} heirs, confused by multiple wills. Possible beneficiary John Jarndyce of Bleak House welcomes orphaned cousins Ada Clare and Richard Carstone — also potential heirs — as his wards, and has hired Esther Summerson as a housekeeper and companion for Ada. Lady Honoria Dedlock, married to the <b>imperious</b> baronet Sir Leicester, is also a possible beneficiary of the estate. The Dedlocks' lawyer, Tulkinghorn, sniffs out a connection between Lady Dedlock and a newly deceased man called Nemo; as he tries to discover Nemo's true identity, Lady Dedlock secretly seeks information about the dead man herself. Meanwhile, Richard and Ada are falling in love. Richard keeps changing his mind on which career to pursue — first a physician, then a lawyer and then a soldier — but the prospect of his inheritance from the ongoing litigation begins to consume him, despite warnings from John, now his former guardian. Esther and the young doctor Allan Woodcourt are attracted to each other, but Esther feels unworthy and Allan accepts a commission as a navy physician.|$|E
25|$|While Berlioz is {{best known}} as a composer, he was also a {{prolific}} writer, and supported himself for many years by writing musical criticism, utilising a bold, vigorous style, at times <b>imperious</b> and sarcastic. He wrote for many journals, including the Rénovateur, Journal des débats and Gazette musicale. He was active in the Débats for over thirty years until submitting his last signed article in 1863. Almost from the founding, Berlioz was a key member of the editorial board of the Gazette as well as a contributor, and acted as editor on several occasions while the owner was otherwise engaged. Berlioz took full advantage of his times as editor, allowing himself to increase his articles written on music history rather than current events, evidenced by him publishing seven articles on Gluck in the Gazette between June 1834 and January 1835. An example of the amount of work he produced is indicated in his producing over one-hundred articles for the Gazette between 1833 and 1837. This is a conservative estimate, as not all of his submissions were signed. In 1835 alone, due to one of his many times of financial difficulty, he wrote four articles for the Monde dramatique, twelve for the Gazette, nineteen for the Débats and thirty-seven for the Rénovateur. These were not mere scribbles, but in-depth articles and reviews with little duplication, which took considerable time to write.|$|E
25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most <b>imperious</b> circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the castle}} of Doris, {{preparations}} {{are under way}} for the celebrations of the young countess Raymonda’s name day. Countess Sybille, her aunt, chides those who are present, including Raymonda's two friends Henrietta and Clémence, and the two troubadours Béranger and Bernard, for their idleness and their passion for dancing, telling them of the legendary White Lady, the protector of the castle, who warns the Doris household every time one of its members is in danger and casts punishment on {{those who do not}} fulfil their duties. The young people laugh at the countess’s superstitions and continue to celebrate. The seneschal of the Doris castle announces the arrival of a messenger, sent by Raymonda's fiancé, the noble crusader knight, Jean de Brienne, bearing a letter for his beloved. Raymonda rejoices when she reads that King Andre II of Hungary, for whom Jean de Brienne has fought, is returning home in triumph and Jean de Brienne will arrive at the Doris castle the next day for their wedding. Suddenly, the celebrations are interrupted when the seneschal announces the arrival of an uninvited Saracen knight, Abderakhman and his entourage, who have stopped at the castle seeking shelter for the night. Captivated by Raymonda's beauty, Abderakhman falls in love with her at once and resolves to do anything to win her. The party lasts late into the night and, left alone and exhausted by the day, Raymonda lies down on a couch and falls asleep. As she sleeps, she begins to dream that the White Lady appears illuminated by the moonlight and, with an <b>imperious</b> gesture, orders Raymonda to follow her.|$|E
500|$|The <b>imperious</b> {{person is}} {{successful}} due to both mental and social factors.

500|$|Accordingly, {{while the}} <b>imperious</b> orator {{will tend to}} prefer a passionate crowd over a {{sympathetic}} one, the timid orator (or subject) will have the opposite preferences. The <b>imperious</b> orator is interested mostly in a mob that is more given to rash emotion than to reflection. (Russell 1938:18) The orator will try to engineer two 'layers' of belief in his crowd: [...] "a superficial layer, in which {{the power of the}} enemy is magnified so as to make great courage seem necessary, and a deeper layer, {{in which there is a}} firm conviction of victory" [...] (Russell 1938:18). By contrast, the timid will seek a sense of belonging, and [...] "the reassurance which is felt in being one of a crowd who all feel alike" [...] (Russell 1938:17).|$|E
500|$|Commercially, Streep {{fared better}} with a role in The Devil Wears Prada (also 2006), a loose screen {{adaptation}} of Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name. Streep portrayed the powerful and demanding Miranda Priestly, fashion magazine editor (and boss of a recent college graduate played by Anne Hathaway). Though the overall film received mixed reviews, her portrayal, of what Ebert calls the [...] "poised and <b>imperious</b> Miranda", drew rave reviews from critics and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, as well as another Golden Globe. On its commercial release, the film became Streep's biggest commercial success to this point, grossing more than US$326.5million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|However, Russell {{is quick}} {{to note that the}} {{invocation}} of human nature should not come at the cost of ignoring the exceptional personal temperaments of power-seekers. Following Adler (1927) — and to an extent echoing Nietzsche – he separates individuals into two classes: those who are <b>imperious</b> in a particular situation, and those who are not. The love of power, Russell tells us, is probably not motivated by Freudian complexes, (i.e., resentment of one's father, lust for one's mother, drives towards Eros and Thanatos (Love and Death drives, which constitute the basis of all human drives, etc.,) but rather by a sense of entitlement which arises from exceptional and deep-rooted self-confidence.

It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if <b>imperious</b> circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you."

500|$|My own {{daughter}} [...] is considerably superior in capacity {{to the one}} her mother had before. Fanny, the eldest, is of a quiet, modest, unshowy disposition, somewhat given to indolence, which is her greatest fault, but sober, observing, peculiarly clear and distinct in the faculty of memory, and disposed to exercise her own thoughts and follow her own judgment. Mary, my daughter, is the reverse of her in many particulars. She is singularly bold, somewhat <b>imperious,</b> and active of mind. Her desire for knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes is almost invincible. My {{own daughter}} is, I believe, very pretty; Fanny {{is by no means}} handsome, but in general prepossessing.|$|E

Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely <b>imperious,</b> self-centered tone."

500|$|In 2000, {{after the}} match fixing scandal {{by some of}} the players of the team, Ganguly was named the Captain of the Indian cricket team.

He began well as a captain, leading India to a series win over South Africa in the five-match one day series and led the Indian team to the finals of the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy. He scored two centuries, including one in the final; however, New Zealand still won by four wickets. The same year, Ganguly tried his hand at county cricket career in England but was not successful.

(The president was denounced by the 14-year-old William Cullen Bryant, who called him [...] "Napoleon's slave" [...] and a [...] "willing vassal to <b>imperious</b> France".) Jefferson's developing view of international politics led him to observe that the United States should retreat from intercession in European affairs (for which he had been a lukewarm advocate) and pursue a more-modest, less-committed course.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, the General is 46years old and slowly dying on his last journey to the port of Cartagena de Indias, where he plans to set sail for Europe. As Palencia-Roth notes, [...] "Bolívar is cast here not only as a victim but as an agent of Latin America's tragic political flaws". The fortunes of the historical Simón Bolívar began to decline in 1824 after the victory of his general Antonio José de Sucre at Ayacucho. The novel draws {{on the fact that the}} historical Bolívar never remarried after the death of his wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza. García Márquez uses other documented facts as starting points for his fictional portrait of Bolívar–for example, his dedication to the army above all else, his premature aging, and his bad temper.
