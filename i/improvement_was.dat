5|$|The {{design of}} the Ibuki class was a minor {{improvement}} over the last pair of the Mogami class after those ships had been upgraded during the late 1930s. The main <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> {{the replacement of the}} triple torpedo tube mounts in the older ships with quadruple mounts. They cost 60,000,000 yen each and had a crew of 54 officers and 822 enlisted men.|$|E

He also traveled to California to witness the filming of the book.|$|E
5|$|Ball's successor, Lou Macari, was {{appointed}} in May 1991, {{prior to the}} start of the 1991–92 season. The <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> immediate, as Stoke narrowly missed out on promotion in his first season in charge, finishing fourth in the Third Division. He also clinched a cup for the club; the Football League Trophy was won with a 1–0 victory against Stockport County at Wembley; Mark Stein scored the only goal of the game. The following season, 1992–93, promotion was achieved from the third tier, with Stoke finishing as league champions. Stein, a £100,000 purchase from Oxford United, scored 26 goals during the season as Stoke amassed a total of 93 points. Macari left in October 1993 to take over as manager of Scottish side Celtic, and Stein also departed in a £1.5m move to Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during the Easter Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment.

5|$|Early <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out}} with the {{traditional}} tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E
5|$|MDSHA {{conducted}} {{its first}} study on expanding US113 north of Berlin to a divided highway {{in the early}} 1970s. Although US113 was not expanded at that time, preparations for a future expansion were started, including acquisition of right of way along the proposed route. When MD 90 was built from US 50 to east of US 113 between 1973 and 1976, its interchange with the future course of US 113 was partially constructed. MDSHA conducted a second planning study in the late 1980s; in 1990, the agency decided to implement intersection improvements instead of constructing a divided highway. One particular <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> reconstructing the highway immediately {{to the south of}} the Delaware state line to better tie into the divided highway in Delaware in 1989 and 1990.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and {{isolated}} dwellings. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing), becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house throughout Scotland before agricultural <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> a byre-dwelling or long house, with humans and livestock sharing a common roof, often separated by only a partition wall. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast, many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows.|$|E

5|$|The first {{design in}} the second {{generation}} of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conti di Cavour class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered {{in response to the}} French s. They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships. All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw {{a change}} in captain and coach, with Todd Blackadder succeeding Loe as captain and Wayne Smith taking over as coach. With five wins, the team finished the round-robin stage in sixth place. The <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> particularly illustrated by the Crusaders' 29–28 loss to the defending champions, the Blues, which contrasted with their 49–18 loss the previous season. (The Blues also {{went on to win}} the 1997 title). During this loss, Leon MacDonald was taken out with a shoulder charge by Robin Brooke. While the Crusaders attempted to get MacDonald back on the field, the Blues scored two tries, including one by Brooke, who was later suspended for two weeks for the shoulder charge. In their last game of 1997, the Crusaders beat the Queensland Reds 48–3 at Lancaster Park, now known as AMI Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF was working on the Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive <b>improvement,</b> <b>was</b> in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E

5|$|Chambers' {{return to}} {{athletics}} took an unusual turn when he confirmed in March 2008 {{that he had}} joined English rugby league team Castleford Tigers on trial; a move which surprised and angered in equal measure given the fact he had never played the sport before. The Rugby Football League did not object to the move, {{in spite of his}} drug-damaged reputation, but stated much <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> needed prior to any appearance for Castleford in the Super League competition. At a rugby press conference, Chambers expressed a desire to compete in the Beijing Olympics, casting doubt on his dedication to his new career. Chambers officially registered as a player with the Rugby Football League, and Martin Offiah declared that he was prepared to mentor Chambers. He completed training with the Castleford Tigers first-team squad and made his début in a reserve game against York City Knights, but Castleford announced {{that they would not be}} offering him a contract.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and {{isolated}} dwellings.

5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex {{operation}} that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, {{construction of new}} roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> {{the reconstruction of the}} I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991. The modern ramps from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695's ramp over these two ramps was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most {{of history}} the {{mortality}} rate of TBI {{was thought to be}} 100%. However, in 1871 a healed TBI was noted in a duck that had been killed by a hunter, thus demonstrating that the injury could be survived, at least in the general sense. This report, made by Winslow, was the first record in the medical literature of a bronchus injury. In 1873, Seuvre made one of the earliest reports of TBI in the medical literature: a 74-year-old woman whose chest was crushed by a wagon wheel was found on autopsy to have an avulsion of the right bronchus. Long-term survival of the injury was unknown in humans until a report was made of a person who survived in 1927. In 1931, a report made by Nissen described successful removal of a lung in a 12-year-old girl who had had narrowing of the bronchus due to the injury. Repair of TBI was probably first attempted in 1945, when the first documented case of a successful suturing of a lacerated bronchus was made. Prior to 1950, {{the mortality rate}} was 36%; it had fallen to 9% by 2001; this <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> likely due to improvements in treatments and surgical techniques, including those for injuries commonly associated with TBI.|$|E
