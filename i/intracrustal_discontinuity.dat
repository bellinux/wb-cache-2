40|$|During the CINCA- 95 {{experiment}} airgun-shots {{fired by}} the research vessel Sonne as well as chemical explosions (borehole shots, mining explosions and sea shots) were recorded along three W-E onshore profiles with lengths of 200 to 300 km. The records show different qualities, in average they show a good or very good quality. The dense sequence of airgun pulses (about 100 m) gave the possibility to record the complete wavefield of the several wavegroups. Due to the eastward down dipping Nazca-plate the refection points of the wave recorded onshore are situated offshore between the trench and the coast. Besides the typical P_g-phase the wave group reflected at the oceanic Moho is clearly recognisable in the record sections. The oceanic Moho dips down east with about 15. An <b>intracrustal</b> <b>discontinuity</b> with an eastward dip of 20 - 25 is well evidenced by overcritical reflections. The nature of this discontinuity is still unclear. The records of the chemical explosions fired at both ends and inside the profiles enabled the tracing of the Nazca-Moho beneath the Precordillera between the coast and the Preandean depression. Beneath the Longitudinal Valley the oceanic Moho is situated at a depth between 55 and 60 km. (orig.)

40|$|An {{array of}} {{broadband}} seismometers transecting the Talamanca Range in southern Costa Rica was operated from 2005 until 2007. In combination {{with data from}} a short‐period network near Quepos in central Costa Rica, this data is analyzed by the receiver function method to image the crustal structure in south‐central Costa Rica. Two strong positive signals are seen in the migrated images, interpreted as the Moho (at around 35 km depth) and an intra‐crustal discontinuity (15 km depth). A relatively flat crustal and Moho interface underneath the north‐east flank of the Talamanca Range can be followed for a lateral distance of about 50 km parallel to the trench, with only slight changes in the overall geometry. Closer to the coast, the topography of the discontinuities shows several features, most notably a deeper Moho underneath the Talamanca Mountain Range and volcanic arc. Under the highest part of the mountain ranges, the Moho reaches a depth of about 50 km, which indicates that the mountain ranges are approximately isostatically compensated. Local deviations from the crustal thickness expected for isostatic equilibrium occur under the active volcanic arc and in south Costa Rica. In the transition region between the active volcanic arc and the Talamanca Range, both the Moho and <b>intracrustal</b> <b>discontinuity</b> appear distorted, possibly related to {{the southern edge of}} the active volcanic zone and deformation within {{the southern part of the}} Central Costa Rica Deformed Belt. Near the volcanoes Irazu and Turrialba, a shallow converter occurs, correlating with a low‐velocity, low‐density body seen in tomography and gravimetry. Applying a grid search for the crustal interface depth and vp/vs ratio cannot constrain vp/vs values well, but points to generally low values (< 1. 7) in the upper crust. This is consistent with quartz‐rich rocks forming the mountain range...|$|E
40|$|Central America is {{characterized}} by the subduction of the oceanic Cocos Plate underneath the Caribbean Plate and Panama Microplate along the Middle America Trench, in a setting that is transitional between oceanic island arc and continental active margin subduction. In addition to providing an interesting comparison with purely oceanic or continental subduction zones, the Central American subduction zone is particularly fascinating owing to its pronounced lateral variability regarding the nature of the overriding plate, subducting plate, seismicity, volcanism and geochemistry. To explore the deep structure of the subduction zone, a transect of broadband seismometers across the Talamanca Range (Southern Costa Rica) was operated from spring 2005 to spring 2007. This region {{is characterized}} by the subduction of the aseismic Cocos Ridge, which has been observed to dip at an angle of 18 deg down to depths of about 40 km. Based on this shallow subduction angle, it has been speculated that shallow underplating of the Cocos Ridge is responsible for the gap in active volcanism and strong uplift in the Cordillera de Talamanca region. A receiver function analysis of 522 teleseismic earthquakes was performed, yielding 1777 receiver functions. The data from the Talamanca Transect stations was complemented by short-period data recorded at the Quepos network land-stations, adding another 100 receiver functions for 39 events. The Moho of the overriding plate is imaged around 35 km depth, and an <b>intracrustal</b> <b>discontinuity</b> is observed at about 20 km depth, in good agreement with previous active seismic studies. Contrary to expectations, the migrated sections clearly show a steeply dipping (ca. 60 deg) conversion down to more than 150 km depth, interpreted as the subducting slab. 3 d-representations based on the migrated profiles do not indicate significant shallowing of the subducting plate towards the Cordillera de Talamanca. These results indicate {{for the first time that}} the Cocos Ridge may be subducting beneath Southern Costa Rica at a considerably larger angle and to greater depths than previously thought, opening new questions about the mechanism causing the gap in active volcanism and strong uplift in the Cordillera de Talamanca. Possible explanations include a compressional regime hindering the ascent of magmas to the surface or an anhydrous part of the subducting slab, preventing fluid-induced melting in the mantle wedge. Alternatives may be combined subduction/underplating scenarios or a transitional regime. Modelling studies confirm that the dipping feature observed in the migrated receiver functions can be caused by a slab dipping at approximately the same angle. Possible anisotropy scenarios, such as corner-flow and the resulting olivine lattice-preferred orientation, are also investigated. The results point to the existence of mantle-wedge corner-flow, with possible additional arc-parallel flow...|$|E
40|$|A first-order {{process in}} the growth of continents is the {{collision}} and accretion of terranes against continental margins. Collision leads to the formation of a suture zone between the accreted terrane and the former continental margin. New insights on the suturing process are observed from two receiver function transects across the Mesozoic Alaska Range suture zone. Three distinct crustal sections are identified from observations of crustal thickness, <b>intracrustal</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> and Vp/Vs: a northern section with ∼ 27 km thick crust of felsic to intermediate composition, a central section that is ∼ 37 km thick that exhibits <b>intracrustal</b> <b>discontinuities</b> and has felsic to intermediate composition, and a southern section that is ∼ 30 km thick and has a more mafic composition. We interpret these sections to correspond with the former continental margin (Yukon composite terrane), the suture zone proper, and the allochthonous oceanic terrane (Wrangellia composite terrane). The boundary between the Yukon composite terrane and the suture zone appears to be a subhorizontal discontinuity that accommodated underthrusting of crust from the suture zone beneath the former continental margin. The boundary between the suture zone and the Wrangellia composite terrane, in contrast, appears to be a relatively discrete, vertical boundary. The observed variability in the crust across the Alaska Range suture zone is likely controlled by the differing compositions of the terranes involved, which influences how each section responds to precollisional, syncollisional, and postcollisional deformation...|$|R
40|$|We forward modeled the Bouguer anomaly in {{a region}} {{encompassing}} the Pacific Ocean (85 degrees W) and the Andean margin (60 degrees W) between northern Peru (5 degrees S) and Patagonia (45 degrees S). The three-dimensional density model that reproduces the gravity field is a continental-scale representation of density structure to 410 km depth that characterizes the mantle and crust of the oceanic Nazca plate, subducted slab and continental margin with a minimum number of bodies. We predefined the density of each body after studying the dependency of density on composition of crustal and mantle materials and pressure-temperature conditions appropriate for the Andean setting. A database of independent geophysical information constrains the geometry {{of the top of}} the subducted slab, locally the Moho of the oceanic and continental crusts and, indirectly, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary underneath the continental plate. Other boundaries, notably the <b>intracrustal</b> density <b>discontinuity</b> separating upper from lower crust below the continent, were not constrained and their geometry is the result of fitting the observed and calculated Bouguer anomaly during forward modeling. This contribution presents the model to the Andean geoscientific community and contains some tools, like a sensitivity analysis, that helps potential users of the model to interpret its results. We describe and discuss some of these results in order to illustrate the application of the model to the study {{of a wide range of}} phenomena (e. g., modification of oceanic plate structure by hot spots, shape of the subducted slab, thermal structure of the continental lithosphere, compensation mechanism and formation of orogenic relieve, causes of Andean segmentation) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the EU funded THALES project active seismic {{investigations}} were conducted along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, using both, wide-angle and near-vertical techniques. The structure of the Caribbean plate and the subducting Atlantic plate was determined through a combined analysis of ocean bottom seismometer and multi-channel seismic data along a transect between 15 °N and 17 °N. A detailed analysis of a priori and a posteriori information of a Monte Carlo based tomography scheme with a subsequent structural evaluation by forward modeling are applied to a 2 -d seismic profile south of Guadeloupe. The island arc crust of the Caribbean plate has an average thickness of 28 ± 2 km and overrides the approximately 8 km thick late cretaceous (80 Ma) Atlantic crust. The island arc crust shows two distinct reflections, which are interpreted as an <b>intracrustal</b> and Moho <b>discontinuity,</b> respectively. To a depth of 40 km the Atlantic lithosphere subducts at an average angle of 40 °. The accretionary prism gains a thickness of more than 10 km and shows high energy attenuation in the middle prism. A backstop structure is imaged by a strong lateral increase of the vertical velocity gradient superimposed on structural heterogeneities. The decollement zone reaches a thickness of up to 1. 8 km and shows no seismic phase polarity change. The slow convergence rate and the subduction of the Tiburon and Barracuda ridges make this subduction zone a prime candidate for major earthquakes. Between 15 °N and 17 °N, the seismogenic rupture area is approximated by the contact zone between the backstop and the mantle wedge. Accordingly, this area is capable of triggering an earthquake of a magnitude of Mw 7. 6 and indeed makes this active European subduction zone a place of major telluric risk...|$|R
