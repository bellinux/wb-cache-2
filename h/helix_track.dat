40|$|LiC is {{a simple}} but {{powerful}} and flexible software tool, written in MatLab, for basic detector design studies (geometries, material budgets). It {{is based on a}} <b>helix</b> <b>track</b> model including multiple scattering, and uses a Kalman filter for track fitting. We use this tool for comparing two variants of the LDC and one of the SiD layout, by studying track resolutions (∆pT /pT, ∆pT /p 2 T, transverse and spatial impact parameters) over the transverse momentum range 2. 5 < pT < 35 GeV in the barrel region. Investigation of the forward/backward region is so far for LDC only. 1 The Monte Carlo Tool A software tool for detector design, written in MatLab R©, has been developed for tracking studies at the ILC. It aims at investigating the resolution of reconstructed track parameters in the vertex region for the purpose of comparing and optimizing the track sensitive devices and the material budgets of various detector set-ups. The detector model corresponds to a collider experiment with a solenoid magnet and a <b>helix</b> <b>track</b> model. The geometric surface...|$|E

40|$|A novel FPGA based online {{tracking}} algorithm for <b>helix</b> <b>track</b> reconstruction in a solenoidal field, {{developed for}} the PANDA spectrometer, is described. Employing the Straw Tube Tracker detector with 4636 straw tubes, the algorithm includes a complex track finder, and a track fitter. Implemented in VHDL, the algorithm is tested on a Xilinx Virtex- 4 FX 60 FPGA chip with different types of events, at different event rates. A processing time of 7 μs per event {{for an average of}} 6 charged tracks is obtained. The momentum resolution is about 3 % (4 %) for p_t (p_z) at 1 GeV/c. Comparing to the algorithm running on a CPU chip (single core Intel Xeon E 5520 at 2. 26 GHz), an improvement of 3 orders of magnitude in processing time is obtained. The algorithm can handle severe overlapping of events which are typical for interaction rates above 10 MHz. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

40|$|The beams at the ILC produce {{electron}} positron pairs due to beam-beam interactions. This note {{presents for}} the first time a study of these processes in a detailed simulation, which shows that these pair background particles appear at angles that extend to the inner layers of the detector. The full data set of pairs produced in one bunch crossing was used to calculate the <b>helix</b> <b>tracks,</b> which the particles form in the solenoid field of the SiD detector. The results suggest to further study the reduction of the beam pipe radius and therefore to either add another SiD vertex detector layer, or reduce the radius of the existing vertex detector layers, without increasing the detector occupancy significantly. This has to go along with additional studies whether the improvement in physics reconstruction methods, like c-tagging, is worth the increased background level at smaller radii.

50|$|The {{track on}} The Howler {{is made out}} of yellow tubular steel. The {{supports}} for the track itself are steel as well. The total length of the track is 262.5 ft and includes a <b>helix.</b> The <b>track</b> features a chain lift hill and two block sections, which only allows one train to operate at a time. The Howler uses fin brakes to allow the train to be stopped in the station {{at the conclusion of the}} ride.|$|R

Instead, small wheel motors drove it up the incline of a tight <b>helix.</b> The <b>track</b> was also different on Jet Star 3 / Jumbo Jet roller coasters than on most later steel roller coasters. The former has much thinner track rails than the tubular steel of the latter. Riders on the Morey's Piers Jumbo Jet cited its high-speed, banking turns as a noteworthy element.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDynamin {{and other}} {{proteins}} of the dynamin superfamily {{are widely used}} by cells to sever lipid bilayers. During this process, a short helical dynamin polymer (one to three helical turns) assembles around a membrane tubule and reduces its radius and pitch upon guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis. This deformation {{is thought to be}} crucial for dynamin's severing action and results in an observable twisting of the helix. Here, we quantitatively characterize the dynamics of this deformation by studying long dynamin helices (many helical turns). We perform in vitro experiments where we attach small beads to the dynamin <b>helix</b> and <b>track</b> their rotation in real time, thus collecting information about the space and time dependence of the deformation. We develop a theoretical formalism to predict the dynamics of a mechanically continuous helix deforming on long timescales. Longer helices deform more slowly, as predicted by theory. This could account for the previously reported observation that they are less fission-competent. Comparison between experiments and our model indicates that the deformation dynamics is dominated by the draining of the membrane out of the helix, allowing quantification of helix-membrane interactions...|$|R

The rotation and translation cascades are rst decoupled, modeled mathematically and simulated separately to test individual control solutions and stability, followed by total system modeling and simulations {{to verify the}} control solutions and stability of the total system. Both the decoupled systems and the total system are able to track both xed positions and positions that change with time, such as the circle, <b>helix</b> and waypoint <b>tracking.</b> The simulation gures for the spiral trajectory tracking shows a growth in position error as the radius of the circle increases, indicating that the control solutions are struggling with increase in acceleration (jerk), but {{is believed to be}} recti ed by additional compensation terms. Overall the system performs well, and can be presumed stable...|$|R
40|$|For {{growth and}} {{division}} of rod-shaped bacteria, the cylindrical {{part of the}} sacculus has to be elongated and two new cell poles have to be synthesized. The elongation is performed by a protein complex, the elongase that inserts disaccharidepentapeptide units at {{a limited number of}} discrete sites while using the cytoskeletal MreB <b>helix</b> as a <b>tracking</b> device. Upon initiation of cell division by positioning of the cytoskeletal Z-ring at mid cell, a switch from dispersed to concentrated local peptidoglycan-synthesis occurs. From this point on, peptidoglycan synthesis is for a large part redirected from elongating activity to synthesis of new cell poles by the divisome. The divisome might be envisioned as an extended elongase because apart from its basic peptidoglycan synthesizing activity, specific functions have to be added. These are conversion from a cylinder to a sphere, invagination of the outer membrane and addition of hydrolases that allow separation of the daughter cells. The elongase and the divisome are dynamic hyperstructures that probably share part of their proteins. Although this multifunctionality and flexibility form a barrier to the functional elucidation of its individual subunits, it helps the cells to survive a variety of emergency situations and to proliferate securely...|$|R
5000|$|Leaving the station, {{the train}} makes a nearly 180 degree right turn. The train then ascends the lift hill, {{reaching}} {{a height of}} 235 ft. Ascent slows {{toward the top of}} the hill, a safety feature that reduces stress on the chain; it is also an attempt to reduce positive g-forces and increases rider anticipation. The train begins accelerating down the initial 255 ft drop, into an underground tunnel, reaching a speed of 85 MPH. Upon exiting the tunnel, the train heads upwards into a banked right turn that towers above the roller coaster Twisted Colossus. After completing the turn, the train heads down another drop, flattening out to pass by the onride camera. An airtime hill and banked left turn (rather than a helix on [...] "Titan") follows into the mid-course brake run. The train is decelerated quickly and makes a hard left turn out of the brake section. Another 180 degree banked turn directs the train into a 585 degree, descending <b>helix.</b> Then, the <b>track</b> turns upwards and banks left. After an ascending right turn, the train reaches the final brake run.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{boarding}} the train, riders fasten their {{seat belts}} and lower their individual lap bar into place. Both {{red and blue}} trains are dispatched simultaneously and make a 200-degree turn opposite each other and proceed toward the lift hill. The trains meet up again behind the station where they turn back 20 degrees and begin their ascent side by side. At {{the top of the}} lift hill, the trains slowly make their way toward the edge before careening down the first drop, reaching speeds of over 66 mph (106 km/h). Riders race over two small, yet powerful air-time-filled hills before traveling upward and leveling out into a set of trim brakes {{at the far end of}} the out-and-back layout. Here, trains are slowed and riders enter a massive 560-degree helix where they circle downward over a small marsh, gradually picking up speed along the way. The helix circles to the left, allowing the red train to pull away, being on the inside of the track. Riders fly out of the <b>helix</b> before the <b>tracks</b> finally separate. The blue train drops low to the earth in an attempt to gain back some of the ground it lost in the helix, while the red train rises up and passes over the blue. Both trains turn right 20 degrees until they are running parallel with each other but separated by the outbound tracks. The red train drops down after passing over the blue and flies over two more airtime hills while the blue train only leaps over one hill after turning its way through the wooden supports. Both trains then rise into the massive wooden structure of the lift hill and are slowed by a final set of trim brakes. Each train then dives opposite each other into a final 360-degree helix, often accompanied by much squealing from the wheels skidding on the metal rails as they negotiate the turn. The blue train circles at a significantly smaller radius in a final attempt at making up the ground it lost in the big helix. The two trains then emerge and rise into the brake run to determine the winner.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} logically {{divided into two}} main parts. The first part present a ZEUS {{analysis}} which {{was performed on the}} data obtained from electron-proton collisions measured by theZEUS detector for the 2003 - 2007 running period. The full HERA-II integrated luminosity of 376 pb^- 1 is used. The ZEUS detector is sensitive to the full phase space of beauty production,since it has cylindrical geometry, covers a wide rapidity range and was able to measure lowtransverse momentum muons. In this part a measurement of beauty production was studiedvia the process ep →e'bb̅X → e'ννX. Making full use of the HERA-II detector upgrade,secondary vertex information was used to constrain the beauty and charm contribution to thisprocess. The result of this analysis is the measurement of the total, visible and differential crosssections for beauty production. The cross sections are compared to next-to-leading order QCDcalculations. Similar to the beauty events, instanton or instanton-induced events involving heavy avourcan also be a source for non-isolated, both like- and unlike-sign muon pairs. In this analysis,instantons were studied with using QCDINS predictions. The data show no indication forinstanton-induced events. The second part is related to CMS tracker alignment. It uses collision and cosmic datasamples obtained by the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. This part consistsof studies of the CMS tracker alignment weak modes and a detailed study of the -rescaling"weak mode. The CMS tracker alignment weak mode study includes the simulation of the weakmodes, and the alignment implementation on top of such simulation. This study shows thatthe alignment procedure of the CMS tracker is stable with regard to the three weak modes:, Sagitta and Telescope" which stand for three types of systematic shifts of the CMStracker. The -rescaling" weak mode shows a strong and unexpected shift of some trackerdetector components in the z direction. To study the issue, a significant number of testssuch as level structure" alignment only, alignment with fixed end caps, impact of thepT dependence of the tracks on the alignment procedure, the simulation of cosmic data ascollision data, introducing TID, TEC end cap disk constraints and other important tests wereperformed. Even though this issue was not yet fully solved, the studies performed in this thesisshow consistent and detailed steps that help to better understand the issue and solve it in thefuture. The <b>track</b> <b>helix</b> parametrisation of both the ZEUS and CMS experiments was studied. Achecked, detailed description of such parametrisation as well as its transformation from theCMS format into the ZEUS format is performed. In addition, a CMS physics analyses ofB ! J= K decays was started. These studies were performed with the CMS data" forthe 2010 time period. Logically this {{can be seen as a}} first step towards a measurement of thetotal beauty cross section in CMS in the same spirit as the one performed with the ZEUS data...|$|R
