30|$|The {{particle}} shape {{and the size}} distribution of phosphates are important parameters for cosmetic pigment application. Spherical, homogenous particles are expected to spread well on the skin. However, overly small particles are unsuitable because the pigments may enter the pores of the skin. Generally, pigments with sub-micrometer dimensions are used in cosmetic applications. In earlier studies [12, 13, 14], we prepared titanium and zinc phosphate pigments with no catalytic activity. In this study, zinc phosphate, as a novel white pigment, is prepared from zinc nitrate and various phosphate sources, including phosphoric acid, sodium di-hydrogen phosphate, <b>di-sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate,</b> sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium triphosphate. Because pyrophosphate and triphosphate were obtained as sodium salts, sodium di-hydrogen phosphate and <b>di-sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> were also evaluated as phosphate sources.

A mixture of <b>di-sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> dodeca-hydrate and calcium chloride di-hydrate was dissolved in water, and kept {{at room temperature}} for 2 weeks in air or N 2 atmosphere to make apatite hydrogel. The obtained apatite hydrogel contains carbonate ions, and its carbonate content strongly affect the aggregation of particles. With maturation period, the particle size of apatite hydrogel decreased in air, but increased in N 2 atmosphere. The quantity of loaded Cytochrome C in apatite hydrogel formed in air was 0. 490 wt%, while that in apatite hydrogel formed under N 2 atmosphere was 0. 305 wt%. But the quantity of loaded albumin in apatite hydrogel formed in air was less than that in apatite hydrogel formed under N 2 atmosphere.

40|$|Different {{stabilising}} salts {{and calcium}} chloride {{were added to}} raw milk to evaluate changes in pH, ionic calcium, ethanol stability, casein micelle size and zeta potential. These milk samples were then sterilised at 121 °C for 15 min and stored for 6 months to determine how these properties changed. Addition of tri-sodium citrate (TSC) and <b>di-sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> (DSHP) to milk reduced ionic calcium, increased pH and increased ethanol stability in a concentration-dependent fashion. There was relatively little change in casein micelle size and a slight decrease in zeta potential. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) also reduced ionic calcium considerably, but its effect on pH was less noticeable. In contrast, sodium dihydrogen phosphate (SDHP) reduced pH but {{had little effect on}} ionic calcium. In-container sterilisation of these samples reduced pH, increased ethanol stability and increased casein micelle size, but had variable effects on ionic calcium; for DSHP and SDHP, ionic calcium decreased after sterilisation but, for SHMP, it remained little changed or increased. Milk containing 3. 2 mM SHMP and more than 4. 5 mM CaCl 2 coagulated upon sterilisation. All other samples were stable but there were differences in browning, which increased in intensity as milk pH increased. Heat-induced sediment was not directly related to ionic calcium concentration, so reducing ionic calcium was not the only consideration in terms of improving heat stability. After 6 months of storage, the most acceptable product, in appearance, was that containing SDHP, as this minimised browning during sterilisation and further development of browning during storage. ...|$|E

Due to the constraints on releasing saline water, coal mines require additional water storage facilities and therefore seek to minimise their inventory of saline water. Adopting efficient treatment technologies on-site would minimise the risk of wet season run-offs, freshwater contamination and allow segregation of different qualities of water to enable greater water recycling. This study aims to evaluate the application of an integrated forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO) system with three different actual coal mine waters, containing various concentrations of sulphates and silica that are generally associated with scaling and fouling of membrane systems. Three different FO draw solutions, <b>di-sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> (DHSP), sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) and sodium lignosulphonate (SLS) were evaluated. Two different modes of integrating the FO and RO systems were identified. The integrated system was able to concentrate the brackish mine waters, recovering more than 80 % of the volume of mine water and obtaining dischargeable quality treated water. Simple physical cleaning with clean water circulation was found to be effective in restoring the FO water flux. The osmotic gradient between two mine waters was also utilised to adopt mine water as a draw solution. The effect of solution temperature on stand-alone and integrated FO and RO systems was also evaluated. The combination of FO with RO provided a better performance than individual FO or RO in treating coal mine wastewater. The FO unit served as an effective pre-treatment system prior to RO and the integrated FO–RO systems has a strong potential to successfully eliminate conventional pre-treatment processes for RO...|$|E

The analytes were detected by UV, in one run. Calibration curves were linear with very good correlation coefficients for concentration ranging from 30 μg kg- 1 to 150 μg kg- 1. The limits of detection (LOD) for sulfonamides ranged from 6. 5 to 0. 14 μg kg- 1. The recovery for spiked chicken muscle with 50 - 150 μg kg- 1 ranged more than 70 %. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the sulfonamides for six measurements at 50 μg kg- 1, 100 μg kg- 1 and 150 μg kg- 1 were less then 15 %. These parameters met the EU criteria for method validation. The results were confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using multiple reacting monitoring, as operating mode. Confirmation require the retention times of the analytes to be within ± 2. 5 % of the retention times of the standards, presence of the parent ion and two characteristic fragment ions (product ions) per analyte, as well as the relative ion abundance ratios of the fragment ions shall correspond to ratios obtained for the standards, within permitted limits. The transition of two common product ions at m/z 155. 7 and 107. 5 were monitored for all sulfonamides. Each of the analytes, in all tested samples met the confirmation criteria.

40|$|Introduction Recent studies {{prove that}} the number of {{patients}} with inflammatory bowel disease is increasing all over the world due to contamination, industrialization and changes in the style of live. Some studies have shown that 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA), an anti-inflammatory agent, must be the election treatment for these pathologies. In recent years, the production of microparticles systems seems to be equally promising to develop dosage forms {{in order to reduce the}} dosage frequency (1). On the other hand, the efficacy of this drug in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases may be optimized with a controlled release drug delivery system which maximizes topical exposure of the drug to the diseased tissue and minimizes systemic absorption of the drug (2). Therefore, the objective of the present paper is to design an oral multi-unit dosage form containing 5 -ASA that protects drug up to colon without causing toxicity. The proposed system consists of beads of several compositions (polymers with different nature and characteristics) introduced in an enteric hard gelatin capsule to obviate the transition across the stomach. Materials and Methods 5 – Aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) was a gift from Schering Plough (Madrid, España). Eudragit ® FS 30 D was received from Degussa Iberia S. A. (Barcelona, España). The following materials were obtained from the indicated suppliers and used as received: alginic acid sodium salt (low viscosity) and calcium chloride anhydrous from Sigma (Barcelona, Spain); chitosan, low molecular weight, from Aldrich Chemical Company (Barcelona, Spain); <b>di-sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> anhydrous, potassium di-hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid from Panreac Química S. A. (Barcelona, España). Alginate beads were prepared as follows: an alginate solution of 2 % w/v was prepared dissolving the sodium alginate in distilled water under stirring. The drug suspension (0. 5 % w/v) was added to the alginate solution. This mix was dropped, from a hypodermic syringe, into 1. 4 % w/v CaCl 2 solution. The gel beads, which formed immediately in the CaCl 2 solution, were incubated at room temperature (22 ºC) and in darkness in this solution for 24 h to ensure complete reaction. After this time, the beads were filtered and dried using microwaves (3200 W) during 110 minutes with 10 % of power. In order to prepare Eudragit FS 30 D/alginate beads, a suspension of the polymer (26 % or 13 % w/v) was added in the mix previously described under agitation, before dropping over a 1. 4 % w/v CaCl 2 solution. Finally, the chitosan/alginate beads were elaborated by adding chitosan (0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 5 % w/v) to distilled water containing 1 % (v/v) acetic acid. The 1. 4 % w/v CaCl 2 solution was added to the chitosan solution. An alginate/drug suspension was added to this solution to form the beads. The beads were incubated and dried under the same conditions as described above. Table 1 shows the composition of the different beads formulations...|$|E
