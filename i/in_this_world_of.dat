2500|$|Author John Kruth writes that, {{with its}} vitriolic tone and an [...] "edge" [...] that was {{unfamiliar}} in the Beatles' work, [...] "Think for Yourself" [...] was [...] "somewhat startling" [...] to many listeners. In a contemporary {{review of the}} album, Record Mirror opined: [...] "Nice song but a feeling hereabouts that there's a sameness {{about some of the}} melody-construction ideas. Maybe we'll lose it later on …" [...] While recognising Rubber Soul as another example of the Beatles [...] "setting trends <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> pop", KRLA Beat admired the [...] "wonderful sound effect" [...] created by McCartney's fuzz bass and concluded: [...] "a good, strong, driving beat will keep this one on top." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Rubber Soul was highly favourable. Allen Evans of the NME {{wrote that the}} band were [...] "still finding different ways to make us enjoy listening to them" [...] and described the LP as [...] "a fine piece of recording artistry and adventure in group sound". While outlining to American readers {{the differences in the}} UK-format release, KRLA Beat said Rubber Soul was an [...] "unbelievably sensational" [...] work on which the Beatles were [...] "once again... setting trends <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> pop". Newsweeks reviewer lauded the Beatles as [...] "the Bards of Pop", saying that the album's combination of [...] "gospel, country, baroque counterpoint and even French popular ballads" [...] lent the band a unique style in which their songs were [...] "as brilliantly original as any written today". Like Newsweek, The New York Times had belittled the group when they first performed in America in February 1964, but following the release of Rubber Soul, according to author Bob Spitz, music critic Jack Gould offered a [...] "glowing tribute" [...] in the newspaper's Sunday magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Following the August 23 Coup of 1944, {{in which}} the PSDR played a {{significant}} part, Antonescu was toppled, and Romania made a swift return to multiparty rule. During the subsequent democratic interval, Moscovici was commemorated by Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște with a belated obituary in Jurnalul de Dimineaţă: [...] "there are very few politicians in our country to have remained faithful to an idea their whole lives. [...] <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> ours, Ilie Moscovici was and endured a socialist. He was not dissuaded by vain ambition. He was not frightened by poverty. He was not influenced by persecution." [...] Although the PSDR was rapidly expanding, claiming some 700,000 members in 1945, it was being undermined by the infiltration of communists, who, inspired by the Soviet occupation of Romania, worked to absorb it into a much smaller PCdR. Addressing {{the rank and file}} of the party, the pro-communist Ștefan Voitec claimed that the merger had been envisaged by Moscovici while he was still alive—a claim that is seen as [...] "opportunistic" [...] by journalist and historian Victor Frunză. The communist takeover was effected at the congress of March 1946, and facilitated in part by Voinea's last-minute defection.|$|E
2500|$|... "Let It Happen" [...] {{opens the}} album, {{and is about}} [...] "finding {{yourself}} always <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> chaos and all this stuff going on around you and always shutting it out because you don't {{want to be part}} of it. But at some point, you realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E

2500|$|Bernini {{was born}} in Naples in 1598 to [...] Angelica Galante and Mannerist {{sculptor}} Pietro Bernini, originally from Florence. He was the sixth of their thirteen children. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was the definition of childhood genius. He was “recognized as a prodigy {{when he was only}} eight years old, [...] he was consistently encouraged by his father, Pietro. His precocity earned him the admiration and favor of powerful patrons who hailed him as ‘the Michelangelo of his century’”. In 1606 his father received a papal commission (to contribute a marble relief in the Cappella Paolina of Santa Maria Maggiore) and so moved from Naples to Rome, taking his entire family with him. Sometime thereafter, word about the great talent of the boy Gian Lorenzo got around and he soon caught the attention of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew to the reigning pope, Paul V, who spoke of the boy genius to his uncle. Bernini was therefore presented before Pope Paul V, curious to see if the stories about Gian Lorenzo's talent were true. The boy improvised a sketch of Saint Paul for the marveling pope, and this {{was the beginning of the}} pope’s attention on this young talent. Once he was brought to Rome, he never left. Rome was Bernini’s city. “For Bernini there could be only one Rome. ‘You are made for Rome,’ said Pope Urban VIII to him, ‘and Rome for you’”. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> 17th-century Rome and religious power that Bernini created his greatest works.|$|E
