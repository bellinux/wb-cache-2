This two-part paper develops a globally optimal algorithm for transient stability control to coordinate preventive actions and emergency actions. In the first part, an algorithm is proposed {{for a set of}} contingencies having identical unstable modes. Instead of iterations between discrete emergency actions and continuous preventive actions, the algorithm straightforwardly searches for a globally optimal solution. The procedure includes assessing a set of insufficient <b>emergency</b> <b>schemes</b> identified by the EEAC; calculating the related preventive actions needed for stabilizing the system; and selecting the scheme with the minimum overall costs. Simulations on a Chinese power system highlight its excellent performance. The positive results obtained are explained by analogizing settlements for 0 - 1 knapsack problems using the multi-points greedy algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{new methods to}} improve the {{performance}} of power system protection {{in the case of}} voltage- and transient instability. These methods are designed primarily to mitigate power system breakdown. Relay algorithms are proposed where conventional distance protection is combined with additional relay criteria. In case of voltage instability the criteria are based on the derivative of the voltage whereas the rate of change of the phase angle of the current is used for transient instability. For generator coherency determination a method based on wide area generator speed measurements and Fourier analysis is proposed. Using this method a concept for a System Protection Scheme addressing inter-area events is introduced. Finally, an <b>emergency</b> <b>scheme</b> based on conventional distance relays is proposed to avoid a complete system collapse in the case of severe voltage instability. The performance of these new methods has been compared with conventional methods based on simulations using different test systems. The proposed relay algorithms improve the relay security with respect to voltage instability whereas the reach of the distance protection is not restricted. Neither the line length, different swing frequencies or faults having a slowly decreasing impedance will affect the performance of the proposed schemes as may be the case when using conventional Power Swing Detectors. The fault clearing will also not be blocked as with conventional PSD applications. The proposed method for establishing generator coherency leads to almost identical results if compared with off-line methods as modal analysis or generator speed. Results obtained from phasor measurements however showed deviations. This work also demonstrates that, taking initial transient distortion after a contingency into account, a reliable coherency is faster obtained by the proposed technique than by methods using pure speed or generator voltage angle measurements. It has been demonstrated that the proposed <b>emergency</b> <b>scheme</b> can save part of the system from a voltage collapse. Black-start can then be avoided and the restoration time can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|This study gives {{voice to}} the women who {{embarked}} on careers as emergency or ‘pressure cooker’ teachers within the South Australian Education Department between 1948 and 1962 and allows them to describe their experiences. In 1948 the Education Minister introduced the emergency teacher training scheme, an ad hoc arrangement that varied over the years according {{to the needs of}} the Department to overcome a severe post-war teacher shortage in State schools. Short courses of teacher training were offered to mature age people, most of whom were married women with children. These ended officially in 1962, much to the relief of the S. A. Institute of Teachers, which criticised the courses as providing manifestly inadequate teacher preparation that could result in harm for the students, schools and the professionalism of teachers. The study investigated the emergency system from an historical and humanistic sociological perspective, using three sets of juxtaposed data to explain the views of the various stakeholders. As one line of enquiry, historical documentation from the Minister of Education, the Education Department, the Education Inquiry Committee as well as the S. A. Institute of Teachers and the print media, were used to establish the views of the proponents and opponents of the emergency teacher training scheme. The other method utilised an oral history or memoir approach to the lives of women teachers who had been largely ignored by historians in the past. This method was grounded in feminist historiography with a focus on the ‘mother-teacher’ role of nurturing young children. Of the sixty respondents interviewed for the study, most were women who had become emergency teachers, but some were Education Department Officers who had been responsible for the training and supervision of these teachers. The interviews, recorded and transcribed by the researcher, were based on a number of questions that elicited concrete and cultural data. Analysis of the extensive data gathered was interpreted using the humanistic sociological approach of Polish-American sociologist, Florian Znaniecki. Initially, a chronological account of the Department’s emergency or ‘pressure cooker’ short courses of teacher training, their gradual modification in the face of teacher criticism and their eventual demise is presented. The subsequent analysis of the women’s comments gives the study a human aspect to provide a far more comprehensive picture of what actually took place in the training courses and in the classrooms of the period, than could be gleaned from official documentation or the objections of critics. The analysis of the memoir data is presented in five chapters that discuss the women’s reasons for applying to be emergency teachers, their experiences in being interviewed, trained and subsequently appointed to schools. In addition, their position in the Education Department hierarchy and the educational debate of whether the pressure cooker women were natural teachers or harmful interlopers are both considered at some length. From the data it was apparent that, while the <b>emergency</b> <b>scheme</b> was not an ideal solution, for the Education Department the <b>emergency</b> <b>scheme</b> achieved its objective in addressing the teacher shortage problem and enabled them to secure the services of the extra teachers required at the minimum wage level. Although some of the worst emergency teachers resigned quickly, in the case of the women interviewed, work compatible with their domestic arrangements which eliminated the need for child care and provided a sufficient and secure income, led to a satisfying long term teaching career until retirement. The long term outcomes of this period can be seen in changes to State legislation in 1972 that resulted in married women, previously excluded from permanency, being granted full status as professional teachers. As well, the 1976 Teacher Registration requirements in South Australia that all teachers have adequate professional training and qualifications, ensured that it would not be easy for emergency schemes to be used again.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an index for judging {{the severity of}} transient events of power systems in simulation. The proposed transient stability index, known as the area-based COI-referred rotor angle index, is developed by {{considering the fact that}} a large-sized power system is divided into several areas according to the coherency of generators in a particular area. It can be assumed that an equivalent single large machine can represent all the generators in that area. Thus, the assessment of rotor angles for all generators can be simplified by only assessing the index of areas in a power system. The effectiveness of the proposed index in assessing the stability of power systems and its ability in pinpointing the weakest area in the power system is analyzed. Furthermore, this paper developed an <b>emergency</b> control <b>scheme</b> known as the combined UFLS and generator tripping in order to stabilize the system when unstable faults occurred in a power system. The proposed index is used to identify the generator to be tripped when the developed <b>emergency</b> control <b>scheme</b> operates.
