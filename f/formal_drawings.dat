40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{ten years}} of effort at Purdue University to improve the technical communication skills of engineering and technology students. While there are many forms of communication that must be mastered by engineers and technologists, the preparation and interpretation of technical drawings and associated process documentation is essential for design concepts to be successfully transferred to actual products. It is also essential that students be able to function effectively in cross-disciplinary teams. With these needs in mind, the authors have experimented with several types of cross-class projects that require engineering students from the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics to communicate technically with students in the Department of Aviation Technology. These projects generally entail preparation of a structural design by engineering students that is then conveyed through <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> {{in a manner that}} results in hardware constructed by the technology students. The various projects have involved several different course interactions at the sophomore, junior, and senior level in the two separate academic units...|$|E
50|$|In {{an oblique}} projections, the {{parallel}} projection rays are not {{perpendicular to the}} viewing plane, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees. In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for <b>formal,</b> working <b>drawings.</b> In an oblique pictorial drawing, the displayed angles among the axes {{as well as the}} foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique projections include military, cavalier and cabinet projection.|$|R

This result is known as Pohlke's theorem, from the German mathematician Pohlke, who published it in the early 19th century. The resulting distortions make the [...] unsuitable for <b>formal,</b> working <b>drawings.</b> Nevertheless, the distortions are partially overcome by aligning one plane of the image parallel to the plane of projection.

40|$|Closed {{or nearly}} closed regions are an {{important}} form of perceptual structure arising both in natural imagery and in many forms of human-created imagery including sketches, line art, graphics, and <b>formal</b> <b>drawings.</b> This paper presents an effective algorithm especially suited for finding perceptually salient, compact closed region structure in hand-drawn sketches and line art. We start with a graph of curvilinear fragments whose proximal endpoints form junctions. The key problem is to manage the search of possible path continuations through junctions {{in an effort to}} find paths satisfying global criteria for closure and figural salience. We identify constraints particular to this domain for ranking path continuations through junctions, based on observations of the ways that junctions arise in line drawings. In particular, we delineate the roles of the principle of good continuation versus maximally turning paths. Best-first bidirectional search checks for the cleanest, most obvious paths first, then reverts to more exhaustive search to find paths cluttered by blind alleys. Results are demonstrated on line drawings from several sources including line art, engineering drawings, sketches on whiteboards, as well as contours from photographic imagery...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{has been}} a natural way for humans to express their {{thoughts}} and ideas since ancient times. People got used to create and understand illustrations. Many wellde ned formal notations have evolved including technical drawings, musical scores, and various diagrams. On the other hand, people use free-form sketches or ad hoc intuitive notations often. Electronic devices equipped with a touch screen take part in our daily lives and make {{it is easier to}} create and share drawings. Naturally, it is more and more desired to have methods for automatic recognition and understanding of drawings. It is much easier and desired in the case of <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> consisting of well de ned entities. A computer system can work further with such recognized drawing { beautify the drawing, rearrange a diagram, perform some actions according to a diagram, or manufacture something according to a technical drawing. On the other hand, it is extremely di cult and potentially unnecessary in the case of free-form sketches. It is often enough to provide the user with tools for easier creation and manipulation with sketches. The reason is that these sketches are meant to be understood by humans only and the computer system serves for their creation, storage, and sharing. Obviously, we can classify drawing into <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> and free-from sketching. This thesis deals with two tasks: recognition of formally de ned diagrams and segmentation of object of interest in free-form sketches. These two apparently di erent topics are strongly related. We assume that the drawing is created on an electronic device and thus it is in form of a sequence of strokes rather than a raster image. We propose a recognition framework for arrow-connected diagrams. We introduce a model for recognition by selection of symbol candidates, based on evaluation of relations between candidates using a set of predicates. It is suitable for simpler structures, in which the relations are explicitly given by symbols, arrows in the case of diagrams. Knowledge of a speci c diagram domain is used. The two domains are owcharts and nite automata. We created a benchmark database of diagrams from these two domains. Although the individual pipeline steps are tailored for these, the system can be readily adapted for other domains. The recognition pipeline consists of the following major steps: text/non-text separation, symbol segmentation, symbol classi cation, and structural analysis. We performed a comparison with state-of-the-art methods for recognition of owcharts and nite automata and veri ed that our approach outperforms them. We also analysed our system thoroughly and identi ed most frequent causes of recognition failures. The situation is more complicated {{in the case of a}} free-from sketching where the user can draw and write anything freely. We cannot expect any particular structure. We can often nd a combination of pictorial drawing with more structured gures and text in form of labels. The classical segmentation by recognition can not be used here. In some cases, the understanding of a sketch might be di cult even for humans. Speci cally, the identi cation of an individual object in a drawing may di er from user to user, case to case. Recent research showed that a single linkage agglomerative clustering of strokes with trainable distance function can be used for segmentation of objects from prede ned symbol classes in <b>formal</b> <b>drawings.</b> The proper distance function can be learned from annotated data. It requires a lot of data and time. We propose an approach combining several pre-trained distance functions for particular structures together to segment object in free-form sketches. We show that the desired segmentation can be achieved in many cases by combining together distance functions trained for very general object types like rows, columns, words, or compact images. We also show that the best combination of distance functions can be found from a very limited data in real time. We propose a segmentation approach, which estimates the optimal combination of clustering distance functions from an initial selection of one object. It results in segmentation of objects, which have similar characteristics to the initial one. Based on this approach, we designed a selection tool bringing additional functionality allowing to select and manipulate the segmented objects seamlessly. The method is suitable for fast rearrangement of sketches during collaborative content creation (brainstorming). Katedra kybernetik...|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of the {{conceptual}} design process, designers start to give tangible form to their thoughts by sketching. This helps with reasoning and communicates ideas to other members of the team. Sketches are gradually worked up into more <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> which are then passed to the other stages of the design process. There are however some problems with basing early ideas on sketching. For example, due to their ad-hoc nature, sketches tend only to be diagrammatic representations and so designers cannot be sure that their ideas are feasible and what is being proposed meets the constraints described in the client brief. This can result in designers wasting time working up ideas which prove to be unsuitable. Also the process of constraint checking is complex and time consuming and so designers tend limit their search of possible options and instead choose satisfying rather than good solutions. This paper describes the INTEGRA project which examines the role of sketching in early conceptual design and how this can be linked to other aspects of the process and particularly automated constraint checking using an IT based approach. The focus for the work is the design of framed buildings. A multi-disciplinary approach has been adopted and the work has been undertaken in close collaboration with practising designers and clients. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{globalisation}} of manufacture {{has forced}} {{many developing countries}} in Asia {{to respond to the}} exacting requirements of quality and interchangeability that involve complex and diverse conventions for graphical and geometrical product specifications. Competing pressure for international recognition of engineering qualifications has reduced the time available in Malaysian universities to teach a range of practical skills, including those of reading and interpreting engineering drawings (RIED), although Malaysian industry has identified inadequacies in the RIED skills of recent graduates. This paper reports the deliberate use of incidental learning to increase RIED skills in groups of undergraduate engineeringstudents byreplacing the familiarline illustrations of parts and machines in the learningtasks of a conventional analytical subject with sets of <b>formal</b> engineering <b>drawings.</b> Participants who were engaged for 14 hours of practical problem solving work in the subject and a parallel CAD-modelling subject, gained measurable skills in RIED.

5000|$|ADLs {{have been}} {{classified}} into three broad categories: box-and-line informal <b>drawings,</b> <b>formal</b> architecture description language, and UML-based notations.Box-and-line {{have been for}} a long time the most predominant means for describing SAs. While providing useful documentation, the level ofinformality limited the usefulness of the architecture description. A more rigorous way for describing SAs was required. Quoting Allen and Garlan (1997), [...] "while these box-and-line descriptions may provide useful documentation, the current level of informality limits their usefulness. Since it is generally imprecise what is meant by such architectural descriptions, it may be impossible to analyze an architecture for consistency or determine non-trivial properties of it. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} check that a system implementation is faithful to its architectural design." [...] A similar conclusion is drawn in Perry and Wolf (1992), which reports that: [...] "Aside from providing clear and precise documentation, the primary purpose of specifications is to provide automated analysis of the documents and to expose various kinds of problems that would otherwise go undetected." ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{computer-based}} design {{tools for}} mechanical engineers are not {{tailored to the}} early stages of design. Most designs start as pencil and paper sketches, and are entered into CAD systems only when nearly complete. Our goal is to create a kind of “magic paper ” capable of bridging the gap between these two stages. We want to create a computer-based sketching environment that feels as natural as sketching on paper, but unlike paper, understands a mechanical engineer’s sketch as it is drawn. One important step toward realizing this goal is resolving ambiguities in the sketch — determining, for example, whether a circle is intended to indicate a wheel or a pin joint—and doing this as the user draws, so that it doesn’t interfere with the design process. We present a method and an implemented program that does this for freehand sketches of simple 2 -D mechanical devices. 1 Sketching Conceptual Designs Engineers typically make several drawings {{in the course of a}} design, ranging from informal sketches to the <b>formal</b> manufacturing <b>drawings</b> created with drafting tools. Drawing is far more than an artifact of the design process; it has been shown to be essential at all stages of the design process [Ullman et al., 1990]. Yet almost all early drawings are still done using pencil and paper. Only after a design is relatively stable do engineers take the time to use computer aided design or drafting tools, typically because existing tools are too difficult to use for the meager payoff they provide at this early stage. Our aim is to allow designers to sketch just as they would on paper, e. g., without specifying in advance what component they are drawing, yet have the system understand what has been sketched. We want to have the input be as unconstrained as possible, in order to make interaction easy and natural; our route to accomplishing this is to build a sufficiently powerful sketch recognizer. It is not yet obvious that a freehand sketching interface will be more effective in real use than a carefully designed menubased system. In order to do the comparison experiments, however, we must first build powerful sketch-based systems...|$|R
40|$|Engineering is to a {{large degree}} about problem solving and {{communicating}} solutions to problems effectively. Despite this, most engineering undergraduate programmes focus largely on technical matters with little time devoted to teaching problem solving skills. This paper describes developing, delivering and assessing a novel course designed to equip students to solve open-ended, ill-defined problems. These kinds of problem are not solvable by computer or easily “outsourced” around the world. Hence graduates with skills at solving them will be well-placed to compete in future employment. Through problem-based and self-led learning the course enabled students to develop expertise at problem definition, option evaluation, engineering communication and conceptual design. To encourage free exchange of ideas and rapid development of design solutions, informal sketching and approximate calculations were emphasised over <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> and precise calculations. Use of Excel as means to communicate, as much as to calculate, was highlighted. The authors recognised that learning through failure is intrinsic to developing problem solving skill so assessment was heavily loaded towards rewarding engagement with the material rather than “correct” solutions. Moreover, early cycles though the design process attracted few marks so that students could build knowledge and ability without fear of being marked down due to poor initial attempts. Staff found that while many students were initially flummoxed by the unfamiliar, non-prescriptive nature of the course, over time the value and purpose were recognised. End of course student feedback was exceptionally positive with many comments recognising the value of the content and style of the course...|$|E
40|$|For {{my senior}} project in drawing, I want {{to record the}} {{creative}} process {{of being in a}} band and making music. I will create a working band with myself playing guitar and writing most of the music. I will also have a drummer, bassist, keyboardist, and another guitar player. The band will practice, have performances and ultimately make a recording. This entire process will be documented through sketches, journals, recordings, and photos. From the very beginning stages, the writing of songs will be recorded by writing down chords, notes, and lyrics. Practices and brainstorming sessions will be recorded on tape. By comparing the early stages of songs with the final recordings, I hope to greater understand my own creative process. Events, feelings, conflicts, ideas, and goals of the band will be written down in a journal. This will show how the band evolves over time. Another part of the documentation will include more <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> and paintings. This visual art will be created {{as a response to the}} music being written or experiences gained by being in the band. Portraits of the band members, videos of performances, photographs and flyers from the shows will add to the visual explanation of the creative process. The goal is to attract an audience for the band through a visual presentation. Hopefully,someone who would not normally like the music of a hard rock band will be intriguedinto listening by the visual component. I am also interested to learn how the drawingswill affect the music and vice versa. By keeping careful and thorough records, I hope tounderstand and share my creative process as well as the final product. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{informal}} visually controlled drawing {{processes are}} seen as traces of wanted, voluntary visual expressions. This aspect of informal drawing processes is stressed by all six students/ children interviewed about similarities and differences. The compulsory aspect {{of what happens in}} the formal arena can not be disregarded, compulsory public school being bound to the national curriculum at all times. But the learning goals in the national curriculum can be attained in different ways, and learning goals can change as discourses in art education change. This can possibly gives room to work within a compulsory school context and still aim for “the flow”. The flow being where students feel they work on gaining a wanted skill {{and at the same time}} are given challenges and help that makes these wanted skills attainable (Csikszentmihalyi, 2002). The web database The Vega files exhibits the <b>formal</b> <b>drawings</b> made in a case seen as exemplary visually controlled drawing teaching, with goals being within the compulsory national curriculum in art & crafts in Norway, and can be seen as a reflection of concepts found in the inquiry. In my opinion, this qualitative inquiry would not be that interesting in an art education context if the informal VC-drawing activities in this age-group were not to be quantified to a certain extent. If informal VC drawing learning/teaching was a rare or practically nonoccurring activity, the comparison, based on qualitative methods of inquiry, with the aim of describing the qualities of formal and informal VC-drawing teaching/learning activities, would not rest on one of several features of informal drawing activity. The drawing web database is one reference for detecting the informal VC processes (see The Vega files and page 92 in Chapter 2). What has been detected as VC processes and semi-VC-processes - resting on the drawing database, the interviews and the observations shows that substantial informal VCdrawing learning (but also teaching) activities are taking place. The third research question can be the basis for the summary, rounding up this inquiry’s main results when comparing the two previously presented cases by structuring the comparisons using the comparative dimensions: What are the similarities and differences between these formal and informal visually controlled drawing processes...|$|E

Using drawing technique, we carried out a systematic investigation on primary school pupils’ conceptions about air breathing and smoking (tobacco and hashish smoking) either before their first formal learning or after it, {{in order to identify}} their alternative conceptions, to monitor the conceptual change and to identify learning obstacles. Results showed no significant differences (p> 0. 05, χ 2 test) between boys and girls. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) were found between before and after teaching. Children’s <b>drawings</b> before <b>formal</b> teaching showed large variety of alternative conceptions (one or two lungs with no links; one lung with one tube; two lungs with two tubes). One week and one year after <b>formal</b> teaching pupils’ <b>drawings</b> were mostly correct and precise (98 % and 95 %, respectively), but pupils made no links with circulatory system. In all grades, children differentiated the tobacco and hashish smoking effects from the air breathing effects by representing the lungs in dark colour.

This study also suggests that teachers may be more efficient in their teaching process if being aware of the patterns of children’s alternative conceptions.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} general problem of {{constructing}} meaningful drawings of abstract graphs, {{in particular the}} application of axial and rotational symmetry, collectively known as geometric symmetry, to achieving this goal. ^ The problem of algorithmically constructing these visually-informative drawings presents two distinct challenges: firstly, a set of explicit and objective drawing criteria must be identified to direct their construction, and secondly, efficient computational techniques must then be developed to actually implement these criteria. ^ Accordingly, a comprehensive list of criteria is introduced, and conflicts between various criteria are revealed. An extensive survey of existing work is then presented, making use of this list {{as a means of}} categorizing and comparing these known results. The construction of symmetric drawings is identified as one of the foremost criteria, since such drawings enable an understanding of the entire graph to be built up from that of a smaller subgraph, replicated a number of times. ^ <b>Formal</b> definitions of <b>drawings</b> and geometric symmetry of graphs are presented, and some of their more important features are discussed. The fundamental problems of determining if a graph has any geometric symmetry, along with several variations, are all shown to be NP-complete in the case of general graphs. ^ Consequently, attention focuses on symmetry in planar graphs. In the case of trees, outerplanar graphs, and embedded graphs, algorithms are successfully developed for detecting geometric symmetry and constructing related drawings, exhibiting the maximum number of simultaneously-displayable symmetries. All these algorithms run in time which is linear {{in the size of the}} graph, and hence are optimal. ^ The thesis concludes by examining several open problems and potential directions for future research in graph drawing. In particular, the problem of drawing graphs which have no geometric symmetry is discussed, and modifications to the algorithms developed here are put forward to handle such cases. ...|$|R
