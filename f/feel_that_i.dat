5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E

25|$|Crews {{was born}} in {{suburban}} Philadelphia in 1933. Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been extremely important to them personally, in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got a little something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E

Hendrix {{was an avid}} fan of Bob Dylan, and especially liked [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". [...] "It made me <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't the only one who'd ever felt so low..." [...] Hendrix said. After the second verse, Hendrix skipped to the fourth. Hendrix played the electric guitar, and music critic Greil Marcus described {{the atmosphere of the}} Hendrix recording thus: ...|$|E

There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{dropped into}} mid-table {{throughout}} the 1973–74 season, with McLintock's departure signalling {{the demise of}} the Double-winning team. Kennedy failed to score from 6 October to mid-January, and speculation rose of possible moves to Sunderland, Newcastle United, or Aston Villa. In February, he released a statement saying that [...] "my game has gone downhill since I got married but has started to pick up again now I am in bachelordom... I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am better off without her". He ended the season in good form, though Mee had already decided to move him on and replace him with Brian Kidd.|$|E

Before it happens you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... Look like this you're gonna be happy. Drive this car you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna wanna fuck you. It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

500|$|Though Lawson {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} career in cookery, {{she is not a}} trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a [...] "celebrity chef". Furthermore, she does not see herself as a cook or an expert in her field. Throughout Lawson's television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, [...] "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ... I have to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to cook the thing again".|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly do not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|On May 17, 2007, Peter Lindgren {{announced}} he would be leaving Opeth after 16years. [...] "The decision has been the toughest I've ever made {{but it is the}} right one to make at this point in my life," [...] Lindgren said. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry." [...] Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained [...] "Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although multi-faceted and complex, Casanova's personality, as he {{described}} it, was dominated by his sensual urges: [...] "Cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life; I never found any occupation more important. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could to make myself loved by it." [...] He noted that he sometimes used [...] "assurance caps" [...] to prevent impregnating his mistresses.|$|R

500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E

500|$|The game is {{generally}} known for fixing problems {{found in the}} first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, {{and the ability to}} carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version's difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a [...] "Healall" [...] spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game [...] "the most difficult Dragon Quest". After Dragon Quest III released, director Koichi Nakamura said [...] "In result, Dragon Quest II received favourable from everybody, but as me creator's side, I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did about only half what I wanted to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Collins, who has {{competed in}} every Games that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, {{was set to}} run the 100 meter dash. Collins {{was not allowed to}} compete by his Olympic {{committee}} after they found out he stayed with his wife, outside of the Olympic village. Collins required to get permission to stay outside the village for multiple nights in a row, and the committee stated he violated team discipline rules. On the issue of not being allowed to compete, Collins said [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should stay in a hotel with my wife, with or without their permission, that’s the honest to God truth whether they like it or not." [...] He planned to never race for the country again, stating, [...] "This is how it ends, it ends on a really sad note. I should have been allowed to run. I don’t see what is the big deal, I am a grown man, I’m just about to become a grandfather." [...] Collins would later compete in the 2016 Olympics under the same flag.|$|E
500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E
