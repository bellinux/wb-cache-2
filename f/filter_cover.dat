40|$|International audienceWe {{design a}} {{variation}} of the Karp-Miller algorithm to compute, in a forward manner, a finite representation of the cover (i. e., the downward closure of the reachability set) of a vector addition system with one zero-test. This algorithm yields decision procedures for several problems for these systems, open until now, such as place-boundedness or LTL model-checking. The proof techniques to handle the zero-test are based on two new notions of cover: the refined and the <b>filtered</b> <b>cover.</b> The refined cover is a hybrid between the reachability set and the classical cover. It inherits properties of the reachability set: equality of two refined covers is undecidable, even for usual Vector Addition Systems (with no zero-test), but the refined cover of a Vector Addition System is a recursive set. The second notion of <b>cover,</b> called the <b>filtered</b> <b>cover,</b> is the central tool of our algorithms.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a method for {{computation}} of persistent homology that performs well at large filtration values.

Finally, we introduce a particular δ-filtered cover, the divisive cover. The special feature of the divisive cover is that it is constructed top-down. If we disregard fine scale structure and X is a finite subspace of euclidean space, then we obtain a filtered simplicial complex whose size is bounded by an upper bound independent of the cardinality of X. The time needed to compute this filtered simplicial complex depends linearly on the cardinality of X. Comment: Added complexity result...|$|R

40|$|Orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets {{became very}} popular image {{processing}} tools but exhibit major drawbacks, namely a poor resolution in orientation {{and the lack}} of translation invariance due to aliasing between subbands. We propose here the construction of log-Gabor wavelet transforms which allow exact reconstruction and strengthen the excellent mathematical properties of the Gabor filters. Two major improvements on the previous Gabor wavelet schemes are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. Secondly, the set of <b>filters</b> <b>cover</b> uniformly the Fourier domain including the highest and lowest frequencies and thus exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible).

40|$|The numerically reconstructed {{images in}} digital {{holography}} contain two undesirable features. After reconstruction, the zero order diffraction {{as well as}} the complex conjugate image will be present in pictures and drastically reduce their qualities. Practical applications of digital holography in the context of characterization and measuring the physical properties of objects require the suppression of these two features, before starting the reconstruction phase. In this work, using the required mathematical functions for suppressing the zero order diffraction and by transforming them to their discrete form, numerical filters for passing over the CCD images have been constructed. After passing these filters over the experimentally recorded CCD images, the reconstruction phase has been completed applying the discrete Fresnel transform. Carefully investigating the quality of various reconstructed images, we {{came to the conclusion that}} if a <b>filter</b> <b>covers</b> a smaller neighborhood of the recorded CCD images, it will have a better performance in suppressing the zero order diffraction.

40|$|Leukocyte extravasation is {{mediated}} by multiple interactions of adhesive surface structures with ligands on endothelial cells and matrix components. The functional role of beta 1 (CD 29) integrins (or very late antigen [VLA] proteins) in eosinophil migration across polycarbonate filters was examined under several in vitro conditions. Eosinophil migration {{induced by the}} chemoattractant C 5 a or platelet- activating factor was fully inhibited by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8 A 2, a recently characterized "activating" CD 29 mAb. However, inhibition by mAb 8 A 2 was observed only under filter conditions that best reflected the in vivo situation, i. e., when the eosinophils migrated over filters preincubated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin (FN), or when the <b>filters</b> were <b>covered</b> with confluent monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). When bare untreated filters were used, mAb 8 A 2 had no effect, whereas the C 5 a- directed movement was prevented by CD 18 mAb. Studies with alpha-subunit (CD 49) -specific mAbs indicated that the integrins VLA- 4 and - 5 mediated migration across FN-preincubated filters, and VLA- 2, - 4, - 5, and - 6 were involved in eosinophil migration through <b>filters</b> <b>covered</b> with HUVEC. In contrast with the activating CD 29 mAb 8 A 2, a combination of blocking CD 49 mAbs or the nonactivating but blocking CD 29 mAb AIIB 2 failed to inhibit completely eosinophil migration over FN-preincubated or HUVEC-covered filters. mAb 8 A 2 stimulated binding to FN but not to HUVEC. Moreover, eosinophil migration over FN-preincubated or HUVEC- <b>covered</b> <b>filters</b> was significantly inhibited by anti-connecting segment 1 (CS- 1) mAbs, {{as well as the}} soluble CS- 1 peptide (unlike migration across bare untreated filters). Thus, inhibition of eosinophil migration by mAb 8 A 2 depended upon the presence of ECM proteins and not upon the presence of HUVEC per se. In conclusion, "freezing" adhesion receptors of the beta 1 integrin family into their high-avidity binding state by the activating CD 29 mAb 8 A 2 results in a complete inhibition of eosinophil migration under physiological conditions. Hence, activation of beta 1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion may represent a new approach to prevent influx of inflammatory cells...|$|R

40|$|Rapid thermal {{processes}} {{are used in}} various key stages in the microelectronics industry. In this study, the heat transfer in a rapid thermal system is modelled with the finite volume method. The influence of the radiative properties of the quartz window on the thermal profile of the silicon wafer is first investigated. The obtained temperatures are interpreted by analyzing the radiative properties according to wavelength and temperature. The wafer temperature profile for a non-optimized heating in steady-state is explained by a four-phase scheme where the radiative heat fluxes are depicted. From this scheme, a filter {{on the underside of}} the quartz window is envisaged to achieve temperature uniformity for the wafer. Two configurations are tested, one where the <b>filter</b> <b>covers</b> the entire lower surface of the quartz window and another where it is placed in a ring close to the reactor wall to confine the infrared radiations with wavelengths beyond 2. 6 μm in order to raise the temperature at the edge of the wafer.
