50|$|In 1999, {{these were}} the first retail {{brokerage}} accounts where every communication and business process was conducted electronically. New account applications, account approvals, monthly customer statements and trade confirmations were all processed over the internet and/or sent electronically. ShareBuilder’s automatic investing system was the first commercial program that employed an in-house share accounting system that accepted customer orders for any stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a dollar-denominated basis, instead <b>of</b> specified <b>share</b> amounts. This enabled the investor to set a pre-determined dollar amount for monthly investing and accumulate both whole and <b>fractional</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> as the program executed. Most importantly, this form of investing is based on aggregating customer orders across all stocks being bought, enabling the trade cost to be spread across a multitude of buyers and allowing efficient order execution for even small orders. For example, a customer investing only $50 each in Google and Microsoft every month would have their order grouped with thousands of dollars' worth of other orders, enabling better order execution, <b>fractional</b> <b>share</b> purchases and a commission as low as $1 per transaction.|$|R

Part III begins with a review of pre-Internet case law pertaining to the use of corporate spin-offs as a means <b>of</b> distributing free <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> It then analyzes the response by the SEC to a number of companies that sought permission to distribute (and in some cases did in fact distribute) <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> in exchange for the provision of personal information. Finally, Part IV analyzes other laws that companies should consider before offering these Internet-based share distribution programs, and concludes that, based upon the value attributed to personal information, certain share distribution programs could violate state pyramid and gambling laws...|$|R
