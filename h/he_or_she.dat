5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E

If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, some {{research}} (Fleeson, 2001) {{suggests that the}} Big Five should not be conceived of as dichotomies (such as extraversion vs. introversion) but as continua.

40|$|Extract] You {{might think}} that a lot of strange things turn up in my backyard, if you didn't {{actually}} live in Ibisville. For the tropics, though, the yard itself is pretty ordinary: picket fence, big hibiscus shrubs, golden cane and fan palms, banks of military ferns, shade-houses at the back and sides. Spreading over it all, the quandong and fiddlewood and African mahogany trees. But an ibis comes, of course, one or several, I can never tell, though <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she's</b> there every year, as soon as it gets dry: striding and jabbing wherever the hoses ran. There are honey-eaters, too, three or four sorts, and once a Wompoo pigeon, orange and green and sumptuous purple bosom, a bulky vision in the quandong tree. And a few times, a black-and-yellow treesnake, getting a bit too close to the windows, in pursuit of poorly cached green frogs...|$|R
