5|$|One of {{the private}} {{investigators}} was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired {{on the recommendation of}} the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.|$|E

5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E

25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with {{approach}} control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} cross-wind over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.|$|E

25|$|At 16:00, the CVR {{showed that}} Captain Tsu left the cockpit; five seconds later, the CVR stopped recording. Tests {{indicated}} that a click would be heard on the CVR recording if the CVR circuit breaker had tripped normally, but not {{if it had been}} pulled out manually. As there was no click, it is likely that Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR circuit breaker before leaving the cockpit. The NTSC and NTSB investigators thought that if Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he must have made up some excuse to get the First Officer to leave the flightdeck prior to disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots' control panels), so his actions would not be noticed. Several minutes later, as recorded by Indonesian <b>ground</b> <b>radar,</b> the aircraft entered a rapid descent, disintegrated, and crashed into the Musi River.|$|E

500|$|Much {{speculation}} {{regarding the}} cause of the accident circulated afterwards. Accusations of foul play circulated widely in the Soviet Union. An investigation was undertaken in the United States and the official report—which did not show evidence of foul play—was made public. As stated in the report, the accident occurred at about 22:05 EDT, the ground impact point located one mile (1.6km) south-west of the airport, at [...] The report goes on to say, [...] "The relatively steep flight path angle and the attitude (the orientation of the aircraft relative to the horizon, direction of motion etc.) and speed of the airplane at ground impact precluded the occupants from surviving the accident." [...] The main point of the report was that it was a rainy night, the pilots were inexperienced, and an accidental, but not uncommon and not usually critical, <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> failure occurred.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} blind bombing in Flagpole led to Grandy {{deciding}} {{to use the}} blind radar technique again. Hubbard was less sure.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, the head of Bomber Command, wished O'Connor luck; his XD827 would make the drop, with Squadron Leader Tony Caillard in XD827, the grandstand aircraft. The aircraft took off at 07:15 on 11 September 1958. Once in the air, though, a fault developed in the <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> transmitter. Grandy then authorised a visual drop.

500|$|By 1 July, the {{regiment}} had 18 Pe-8s for deployment {{during the early}} phase of the Battle of Kursk. The long-range aviation units continued to attack targets in the German rear areas at night, supporting the Soviet ground offensive in the Orel Bulge, called Operation Kutuzov, that began on 12 July. The Germans had transferred the nightfighters of the Fourth Group of Nightfighter Wing 5 (IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 5), flying a mix of Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217 aircraft, to counter the Soviet raids near the Orel area. Initially, the night fighters were ineffective against the Soviet raids, until the deployment of their <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> [...] "eyes". Once the Germans had use of their radar, after the night of 17–18 July, Soviet losses increased sharply. Although the Germans flew only fourteen sorties that night, they claimed eight kills. On the night of 20–21 July, Captain (Hauptmann) Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, commander of IV./NJG 5, shot down three himself. The exhaust plume of the ASh-82 engine {{may have been a}} contributing factor; the engines lacked flame dampening exhausts, making their plume visible from a distance. Despite its losses, the 746th was re-designated as the 25th Long-Range Guards Aviation Regiment (GAPDD) on 18 September 1943 in recognition of its achievements.|$|E
