5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights {{to keep and bear arms}} and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the <b>economic</b> <b>transformation</b> in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions— has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's <b>Economic</b> <b>Transformation</b> Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000m2-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression brought {{low prices}} for farmers and {{unemployment}} for workers. Social tensions increased, including rising antisemitism.

25|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>transformation</b> also altered income structure. A {{noticeable}} {{shift was}} {{the reduction in}} wage differentials. The increased wealth produced by an advanced economy was distributed to wage earners via the system of broad income agreements that evolved in the postwar era.

As a result, blue-collar workers' income came, in time, to match more closely the pay of lower level white-collar employees, and the income of the upper middle class declined in relation to that of other groups.|$|E

500|$|Political and <b>{{economic}}</b> <b>transformation</b> in post-Soviet Russia caused deep {{economic decline}} in the 1990s and particular financial struggles for women. Although many held jobs, women were also expected to be homemakers. Soviet working women often received extensive employment benefits, such as long child-care leaves, which pushed women {{into the role of}} housewife. In the 1990s domestic work grew increasingly demanding as acquiring goods became more time-consuming in the restructured economy. Women’s benefits also made them less attractive employees, and during privatization many companies fired women. While 90% of women were in the labor market in the 1980s, by 1991 women made up 70–80% of unemployed Russians. Those jobs available to women in the 1990s were often in low-wage sectors, and many job descriptions specified that only young, attractive women need apply. [...] Employed women often received significantly less pay than men doing the same work.|$|E
