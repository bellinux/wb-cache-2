40|$|AbstractContrast <b>enhancement</b> is an {{important}} issue in the field of mammographic image processing. It can be classified into two categories: direct contrast <b>enhancement</b> and in direct contrast <b>enhancement.</b> Indirect contrast <b>enhancement</b> involves in modifying histogram of the image. Histogram equalization (HE) is the simplest indirect contrast <b>enhancement</b> technique which is widely used for contrast <b>enhancement.</b> Many variants of HE are proposed so far. Comparison of these techniques is significantly essential in deciding a suitable algorithm for <b>enhancement</b> and further processing. In this paper we applied few indirect contrast <b>enhancement</b> techniques namely histogram equalization, CLAHE, BBHE, RMSHE, MMBEBHE to preprocess the mammographic images. The performance of the methods is measured using effective measure of <b>enhancement</b> (EME) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) ...|$|R
30|$|The image <b>enhancement</b> of {{the image}} is mainly to make the image part of {{interest}} {{of the image}} clearer by image processing, thereby facilitating subsequent image processing. For specific problems, different image components need to be enhanced, and {{the ultimate goal is}} to make the image more suitable for human visual characteristics or machine reading characteristics. Image <b>enhancement</b> cannot increase the amount of information, but simply amplifies a certain type of information of interest. At the cost, many irrelevant and weakly related information is ignored. Image <b>enhancement</b> techniques mainly include arithmetic, logic processing <b>enhancement,</b> space, frequency domain filtering <b>enhancement,</b> histogram conversion processing, and mixed space <b>enhancement.</b> When performing image <b>enhancement,</b> not only an <b>enhancement</b> technique can be applied, but also multiple <b>enhancement</b> techniques can be selected for a better processing effect. There are two main methods of image enhancement: image <b>enhancement</b> in the spatial domain and image <b>enhancement</b> processing in the frequency domain. The spatial domain <b>enhancement</b> technique mainly deals with image bitmap pixels as the processing target, while the frequency domain method achieves the goal by performing Fourier transform on the image pixel stream [14].|$|R

40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} {{is to find out}} if the pattern of delayed myocardial <b>enhancement</b> can be used as a key to diagnose and specify different types of cardiomyopathies. Patients and methods: Fifty-four patients with suspected cardiomyopathy were enrolled in this study. Patients’ age ranged from 3 to 68  years. All patients were subjected to history taking, laboratory investigations, 2 D echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Images were evaluated for presence, distribution, pattern and site of delayed myocardial <b>enhancement.</b> Results: Seven types of cardiomyopathies were diagnosed in this study. Each type had a characteristic pattern of myocardial <b>enhancement.</b> Ischemic cardiomyopathy showed subendocardial up to transmural <b>enhancement</b> within the territory of the coronary arteries. Dilated cardiomyopathy showed midwall linear <b>enhancement,</b> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed patchy midwall <b>enhancement</b> and restrictive cardiomyopathy showed subendocardial circumferential <b>enhancement.</b> Arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia showed <b>enhancement</b> of the dilated right ventricle. Non-compaction showed <b>enhancement</b> of the non-compacted area. Sarcoidosis showed midwall patchy <b>enhancement</b> while Behcet’s disease showed right ventricular subendocardial <b>enhancement.</b> Conclusion: The pattern of myocardial <b>enhancement</b> can be used as a key to diagnose all types of cardiomyopathies.

40|$|This {{pilot study}} determines fast dynamic {{gadolinium}} enhanced MRI contrast <b>enhancement</b> parameters (onset of <b>enhancement</b> {{and time to}} peak <b>enhancement)</b> before and after radiotherapy in 10 cervical carcinoma patients. Before radiotherapy, onset of <b>enhancement</b> and time to peak <b>enhancement</b> were early, with a median of 4. 5 and 5. 2 seconds, respectively. High-grade tumors showed early <b>enhancement,</b> compared with low-grade. After radiotherapy, contrast <b>enhancement</b> patterns differed. In survivors, onset of <b>enhancement</b> after radiotherapy was later than before radiotherapy. In non-survivors, onset of <b>enhancement</b> after radiotherapy was still early. The median difference in onset of <b>enhancement</b> before and after radiotherapy in survivors and non-survivors was an increase of 3. 2 and a decrease of 1. 1 seconds, respectively. Early onset of <b>enhancement</b> after radiotherapy was a better predictor for survival than a high-signal intensity zone on post radiotherapy unenhanced T 1 /T 2 -weighted MRI. It is concluded that <b>enhancement</b> parameters from fast dynamic Gd-enhanced MR images can provide additional functional information with regard to tumor vascularization, and may have prognostic significance.

40|$|Stringent {{radiological}} follow-up {{is essential}} after renal tumor ablation. Drawbacks of postablation follow-up by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are the associated ionizing radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agent. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has shown potential to demonstrate microvasculature without using either ionizing radiation or toxic contrast agent. We assessed the concordance of <b>enhancement</b> patterns of CEUS and CECT/MRI in cryolesion assessment after laparoscopic renal cryoablation (LCA). From 01 / 2006 to 01 / 2009, a CEUS was performed {{before and after}} LCA (3 and 12 months) in addition to regular CECT/MRI. Using an <b>enhancement</b> score (0 =no <b>enhancement,</b> 1 =rim <b>enhancement,</b> 2 =diffuse <b>enhancement,</b> 3 =localized <b>enhancement,</b> 4 =no <b>enhancement</b> defect), the cryolesion was assessed by both modalities, and concordance of <b>enhancement</b> score was assessed. In total, 45 tumors were included (29 biopsy proven renal cell carcinoma (RCC), mean size 2. 66 cm). One cryoablation failed, resulting in a nonenhancing cryolesion apart from the persisting renal tumor. There were no postablation recurrences during the study period. Pre-LCA: Both modalities were available in 26 cases. In 20 out of 26, there was concordance of <b>enhancement</b> score (77 %, all cases score 3 or 4). Three months: Both modalities were available in 32 cases. <b>Enhancement</b> score corresponded in 23 out of 32 cases (72 %). Seven cases showed <b>enhancement</b> on CECT/MRI (" 1 " in six cases, " 4 " in one case) with <b>enhancement</b> score " 0 "on CEUS. Two cases showed <b>enhancement</b> on CEUS without <b>enhancement</b> on CECT/MRI (specificity 92 %, negative predictive value [NPV] 77 %). Except one case, all <b>enhancement</b> resolved on subsequent imaging. Twelve months: Both modalities were available in 21 tumors. <b>Enhancement</b> score corresponded in 19 out of 21 cases (91 %).
