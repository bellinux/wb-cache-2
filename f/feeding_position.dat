40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the removal of gases from paper mill circulation waters experimentally and to provide data for CFD modeling. Flow and bubble size measurements were carried out in a laboratory scale open gas separation channel. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique {{was used to measure}} the gas and liquid flow fields, while bubble size measurements were conducted using digital imaging technique with back light illumination. Samples of paper machine waters as well as a model solution were used for the experiments. The PIV results show that the gas bubbles near the <b>feed</b> <b>position</b> have the tendency to escape from the circulation channel at a faster rate than those bubbles which are further away from the <b>feed</b> <b>position.</b> This was due to an increased rate of bubble coalescence {{as a result of the}} relatively larger bubbles near the <b>feed</b> <b>position.</b> Moreover, a close similarity between the measured slip velocities of the paper mill waters and that of literature values was obtained.

50|$|Petroxestes is a shallow, {{elongate}} boring (a type of trace fossil) originally found excavated in carbonate skeletons and hardgrounds of the Upper Ordovician of North America (Wilson and Palmer, 1988, 2006).

50|$|One of {{the last}} new clip-fed, fixed-magazine rifles widely adopted that wasn't a {{modification}} of an earlier rifle was the M1 Garand rifle. The first semi-automatic rifle that was issued in large numbers to the infantry, the Garand was fed by a special eight-round en-bloc clip. The clip itself was inserted into the rifle's magazine during loading, where it was locked in place. The rounds were fed directly from the clip, with a spring-loaded follower in the rifle pushing the rounds up into <b>feeding</b> <b>position.</b> When empty, the bolt would lock open, and a spring would automatically eject the empty clip, leaving the rifle ready to be reloaded. The M14 rifle, {{which was based on}} incremental changes to the Garand action, switched to a detachable box magazine. However, the M14 could also be loaded via 5-round stripper-clips.|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} {{reflector}} Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs) were built with four <b>feed</b> arms <b>positioned</b> at Â± 45 Â° {{to the dominant}} polarization (usually vertical).

50|$|The rotary or spool {{magazine}} {{consists of}} a star-shaped rotor, or sprocket, actuated by a torsion spring. The magazine may be fixed or detachable.

John Smith patented a rotary magazine in 1856. Another rotary magazine was produced by Sylvester Roper in 1866 and was also used in the weapons by Anton Spitalsky and the Savage Model 1892.

The influence of the excess air, the degree of the air staging, the biomass share and the <b>feeding</b> <b>position</b> of the fuels on the emissions of SO 2, NO and N 2 O were studied. The results showed that {{an increase in the}} biomass shares resulted in an increase of the CO concentration in the flue gas, probably due to the high volatile content of the biomass. In co-firing, the emission of SO 2 increased with increasing biomass share slightly, however, non-linear increase relationship between SO 2 emission and fuel sulfur content was observed. Air staging significantly decreased the NO emission without raising the SO 2 level. Although the change of the fuel <b>feeding</b> <b>position</b> from riser to downer resulted in a decrease in the NO emission level, no obvious change was observed for the SO 2 level. Taking the coal <b>feeding</b> <b>position</b> R as a reference, the relative NO emission could significantly decrease during co-firing coal and biomass when feeding fuel at position D and keeping the first stage stoichiometry greater than 0. 95.
