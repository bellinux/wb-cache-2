5|$|The gate {{formed by}} the Î± {{subunits}} prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering {{the interior of the}} 20S particle. The ATP molecules bound before the initial recognition step are hydrolyzed before translocation. While energy is needed for substrate unfolding, it is not required for translocation. The assembled 26S proteasome can degrade unfolded proteins {{in the presence of a}} non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, but cannot degrade folded proteins, indicating that energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for substrate unfolding. Passage of the unfolded substrate through the opened gate occurs via <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> if the 19S cap is in the ATP-bound state.|$|E
5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E

25|$|An {{increased}} intracellular ATP:ADP ratio {{closes the}} ATP-sensitive SUR1/Kir6.2 potassium channel (see sulfonylurea receptor). This prevents potassium ions (K+) from leaving the cell by <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion,</b> {{leading to a}} buildup of intracellular potassium ions.

25|$|Organisms, and {{all other}} {{metabolic}} systems, require some input of nutrients. Typically the rate of uptake of nutrients is dictated by their availability (a nutrient that is not present cannot be absorbed), their concentration and diffusion constants (higher concentrations of quickly-diffusing metabolites are absorbed more quickly) and the method of absorption (such as active transport or <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> versus simple diffusion).|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{however, the}} number of armed {{conflicts}} in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, {{the civil war in}} Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016.

50|$|Oxygen is a polar {{molecule}} which binds with {{red blood cells}} in the blood stream. The oxygen affinity with hemoglobin on red blood cell surfaces enhances this bonding ability. In a system of <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> of oxygen, there is a tight relationship between the ligand which is oxygen and the carrier which is either hemoglobin or myoglobin. This mechanism of <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> of oxygen by hemoglobin or myoglobin was discovered and initiated by Wittenberg and Scholander. They carried out experiments to test for the steady-state of diffusion of oxygen at various pressures. Oxygen-facilitated diffusion occurs in a homogeneous environment where oxygen pressure can be relatively controlled. For oxygen diffusion to occur, {{there must be a}} full saturation pressure (more) {{on one side of the}} membrane and full reduced pressure (less) on the other side of the membrane i.e. one side of the membrane must be of higher concentration. During <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion,</b> hemoglobin increases the rate of constant diffusion of oxygen and <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> occurs when oxyhemoglobin molecule is randomly displaced.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> is {{the passage}} of {{molecules}} or ions across a biological membrane through specific transport proteins and requires no energy input. <b>Facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> is used {{especially in the case}} of large polar molecules and charged ions; once such ions are dissolved in water they cannot diffuse freely across cell membranes due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that make up the bilayers.The type of carrier proteins used in <b>facilitated</b> <b>diffusion</b> is slightly different from those used in active transport. They are still transmembrane carrier proteins, but these are gated transmembrane channels, meaning they do not internally translocate, nor require ATP to function.
