5|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{developed}} in the 19th century the trade guilds became <b>irrelevant,</b> and their regulatory powers were removed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was <b>irrelevant</b> to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was <b>irrelevant,</b> and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy {{responded that}} {{what people do}} is <b>irrelevant.</b> He argued that what is really needed are {{machines}} that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.|$|E
5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as <b>irrelevant,</b> persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of that century, some {{boarding}} schools like Eton College and Winchester College thrived educating {{the sons of the}} aristocracy, but most endowed grammar schools were in decline, their classical curricula seen as <b>irrelevant</b> to the industrial age.|$|E
5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that he could get a grasp of the situation without wading through <b>irrelevant</b> court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|In this case, {{the fact}} that the value on the left of OR is unknowable is <b>irrelevant,</b> because the outcome of the OR {{operation}} would be True regardless of the value on the left.|$|E
5|$|It {{lost its}} {{position}} when {{the roads were}} improved, making it practical for factors from Liverpool and elsewhere to travel into Wales and purchase cloth directly from the makers, and became <b>irrelevant</b> when the Industrial Revolution made trade guilds obsolete. Today it survives as a charity that runs almshouses in Shrewsbury.|$|E
5|$|Lenyadri {{is one of}} {{the eight}} revered Ganesha temples collectively called Ashtavinayaka. While some believe that order of visiting the temples in an Ashtavinayaka pilgrimage is <b>irrelevant,</b> Lenyadri is usually visited as the 6th temple.|$|E
5|$|No {{surviving}} Greek texts written {{after the}} year 100 can be securely {{identified as having}} a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became <b>irrelevant</b> to Christians, who were thus unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of medieval Jewish culture has preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March, Rodzianko sent {{guards to}} Putyatina's {{apartment}} to ensure Michael's safety, and Michael signed a document {{drawn up by}} Rodzianko and Grand Duke Paul proposing {{the creation of a}} constitutional monarchy. The newly formed Petrograd Soviet rejected the document, which became <b>irrelevant.</b> Calls for the Tsar's abdication had superseded it.|$|E
5|$|Steve and Miranda Parker adopted Bridget {{when she}} was 6 years old, along with her older brother Riley. Being adopted never worried Bridget and it was <b>irrelevant</b> to her day-to-day life as Steve and Miranda were the only parents she had ever known.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} promulgated by Thomas Jefferson in 1801, in {{reference}} to a 1796 address by George Washington. Despite its enduring influence on U.S. foreign-policy discussions, Washington said privately that the view on which his pronouncements were based would probably be <b>irrelevant</b> in 20 years due to a changing geopolitical situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} guns, armor, ordnance, and design was {{changing}} rapidly, so experience could quickly become <b>irrelevant.</b> Combat {{experience in the}} Spanish–American War had shown the value of many smaller guns at close range, where the larger guns had been inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|After the war, coastal defences became {{increasingly}} <b>irrelevant</b> as nuclear weapons came {{to dominate the}} battlefield. The remaining Device Forts still in military use were initially garrisoned with reservist units and then closed as military establishments. St Catherine's and Portland were decommissioned in the late 1940s, Hurst, Pendennis and Yarmouth in the 1950s, Southsea in 1960 and, after, the closure of its air base, Calshot followed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott {{predicted}} that battleships {{would soon be}} made <b>irrelevant</b> by aircraft. By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled The Command of the Air, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.|$|E
5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were <b>irrelevant</b> {{to the business of}} selecting fiction.|$|E
5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as <b>irrelevant</b> and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is <b>irrelevant.</b> On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated as <b>irrelevant</b> by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather {{than those of the}} mainstream and eschew formal modeling in favor of more abstract theoretical work.|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is <b>irrelevant</b> to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Bavarian Administrative Court {{ruled that}} a woman working in a children's daycare centre, whose {{employment}} had been terminated when her ex-husband identified her as a Scientologist, should be reinstated. The woman had demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that her Scientological beliefs were <b>irrelevant</b> to her work. According to the agreement that concluded the case, she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work, and to inform the children's parents of her membership in Scientology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were <b>irrelevant</b> started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{diamonds}} {{are valued}} mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly <b>irrelevant.</b> About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20tonnes annually) are unsuitable {{for use as}} gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as bort). synthetic diamonds, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3billion carats (600tonnes) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the {{youngest}} {{was seven years}} old. The prosecutors found Kids Can Say No! on YouTube and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled <b>irrelevant</b> to the case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{case was}} that Johor had {{original}} title to Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. Johor had not ceded Pedra Branca to the United Kingdom, but had merely granted permission for the lighthouse {{to be built}} and maintained on it. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. Further, the 1953 letter had been unauthorised and the official reports and maps it had issued were either <b>irrelevant</b> or inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Michael Weyland's {{ambiguous}} {{humanity is}} a subject of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of a theme of the Alien franchise: what matters is a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is <b>irrelevant</b> whether he is a human or an android.|$|E
5|$|Skelton {{was bitter}} about CBS's {{cancellation}} {{for many years}} afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be <b>irrelevant,</b> he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion <b>irrelevant.</b> They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} scenery and overall {{production}} quality, considering the film {{an improvement over}} staged adaptations of the novel. Others found the scenery <b>irrelevant</b> and the story confusing. Despite mixed reviews, the film was financially successful, reportedly setting box office records. The following year, a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel, Beulah, was marketed as a sequel. As with most Balboa films, St. Elmo is now believed lost.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While <b>irrelevant</b> during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed {{a limit of}} 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years treaty battleships were commissioned to build up to this limit. Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, {{and the arrival of}} the Second World War, eventually made this limit <b>irrelevant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} {{considered}} using specialised Vietnamese language {{skills as a}} means of gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it, citing that infiltration and clandestine anti-colonial techniques were rendering them <b>irrelevant.</b> The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence, and that a degree of expertise – to improve command skills – was all that one would need.|$|E
5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and <b>irrelevant</b> because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{was created}} {{the border between}} Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern {{boundary}} of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language {{would continue to be}} spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as Cambria irredenta. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was <b>irrelevant</b> to the purposes of its framers.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming <b>irrelevant</b> sophistry.|$|E
