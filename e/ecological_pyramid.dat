2500|$|It is {{the case}} that the biomass of each trophic level {{decreases}} {{from the base of the}} chain to the top.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the relationships between food intake, biomass and production of a population of the upland bully, Philypnodon breviceps Stokell, in a small Canterbury lake. Early studies of fish populations were confined essentially to descriptive aspects of a species' biology (food habits, growth, life history and reproductive biology). However the inadequacy of this type of information for a complete understanding of the ecology of a fish population, particularly with respect to management of fisheries, was soon realised (Ricker, 1946), and in recent years increasing emphasis has been placed on the more functional aspects of aquatic ecosystems. This approach has been stimulated by the early contributions of such workers as Thienemann (1926) and Elton (1927), who first introduced the concepts of trophic levels, ecological niches and <b>ecological</b> <b>pyramids.</b> With the application of the laws of thermodynamics to ecological theory {{at about the same time}} (for example, Lotka, 1925), it became possible to consider the dynamic processes associated with the flow of energy through successive levels of a food chain. This trophic-dynamic approach was clearly outlined in the classic paper of Lindemann (1942), which provided a basic model for subsequent research in ecological energetics...|$|R

Literature survey reveals that even adaptive organisms such as algae which have proved to tolerateadverse and fluctuating environmental conditions are prone to nanotoxicity as a result of defective photosyntheticsystem. The microbes such as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and other beneficial soil microorganismshave been reported to be inhibited in its functionalities by nanoparticles but their relative toxicities are quiteinconclusive and warrant further investigations. Despite plants have evolved tolerance mechanisms to deterxenobiotics, they expressed their sensitivity to some of the nano-particles as a consequence of physical andchemical routes of action. In animal models (rodents), the data have vividly shown that the nanoparticles havecaused significant inflammatory effects while in aquatic system (fish) nanoparticles are found to accumulate invarious organs besides causing morphological dysfunctions. In the case of humans, nano-particles enter primarilythrough inhalation which causes inflammation and ultimately cancer. Overall, the nanotoxicity in biologicalsystems is mainly caused by the excessive production of reactive oxygen species that damages the living cells. Despite this mechanism has been unequivocally demonstrated in some case studies, scientists are still workingharder to establish a clear relationship between nanoparticles and its toxicity impacts...|$|R

Environmental education is the interdisciplinary field of study that aims to increase understanding of ecology for sophisticated individuals who are sensitive about it. Raising such individuals has developed positive behavioural changes in attitudes towards the environment and it is an important step in understanding both the relationships and integrity of nature. Integrity begins with a level of realizing and appreciating the fact that each human being is a part of nature. Therefore each human being must take on certain responsibilities. It is defined in the motto as “damage to nature, damage to yourself”. In environment-human interaction, ecological-literate individuals realize and appreciate the “maximum harmonization minimum damage” principle.

It has always been looked on as a key source of stability, {{survival}} and evolution of the oasis agro-system since it constitutes the basic features of the <b>ecological</b> <b>pyramid</b> in desert regions. Determining genetic variability and cultivars identification in date palm are two major important factors in breeding programs, characterization of germplasm, and conservation purposes. The genetic variation of seed proteins was assayed by SDS-PAGE for 9 cultivars in Shahdad region in Iran. A total of 16 alternative protein bands with different mobility rates were identified within a molecular weight range of 11 KDa to 350 KDa. Then, electrophorogram for each cultivar was scored, and Jaccard‘s Similarity Index was calculated. Relying on UPGMA and NJ methods, genetic diversity of cultivars was evaluated by constructing the dendrogram for protein bands. Moreover, genetic distance was calculated {{for all of the}} cultivars.   It is concluded that seed storage protein profiles could be useful markers in genetic diversity studies and classification of cultivars. The cultivars from Shahdad were well separated from each other. This might have been done due to their unique genetic build-up. The cluster analysis displayed five major classes. In order to precise this assumption, data were computed to perform a PCA. Cluster analysis and PCA demonstrated their validity in establishing genetic diversity.

40|$|Abstract Background The energy {{requirement}} of species at each trophic level in an <b>ecological</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{is a function}} of the number of organisms and their average mass. Regarding human populations, although considerable attention is given to estimating the number of people, much less is given to estimating average mass, despite evidence that average body mass is increasing. We estimate global human biomass, its distribution by region and the proportion of biomass due to overweight and obesity. Methods For each country we used data on body mass index (BMI) and height distribution to estimate average adult body mass. We calculated total biomass as the product of population size and average body mass. We estimated the percentage of the population that is overweight (BMI[*]>[*] 25) and obese (BMI[*]>[*] 30) and the biomass due to overweight and obesity. Results In 2005, global adult human biomass was approximately 287 million tonnes, of which 15 million tonnes were due to overweight (BMI > 25), a mass equivalent to that of 242 million people of average body mass (5 % of global human biomass). Biomass due to obesity was 3. 5 million tonnes, the mass equivalent of 56 million people of average body mass (1. 2 % of human biomass). North America has 6 % of the world population but 34 % of biomass due to obesity. Asia has 61 % of the world population but 13 % of biomass due to obesity. One tonne of human biomass corresponds to approximately 12 adults in North America and 17 adults in Asia. If all countries had the BMI distribution of the USA, the increase in human biomass of 58 million tonnes would be equivalent in mass to an extra 935 million people of average body mass, and have energy requirements equivalent to that of 473 million adults. Conclusions Increasing population fatness could have the same implications for world food energy demands as an extra half a billion people living on the earth. </p...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{scholarship}} in early medieval studies and other allied fields has increasingly addressed {{the representation of}} relationships between humans and non-humans. The latter category has included actors of various kinds, including those we would most often think of as active (mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, insects, and so on), and those which we would be less accustomed to attribute any independent life {{at all in the}} modern world, such as human-made or naturally-occurring objects and phenomena, to which we would be less accustomed to attribute any independent life at all in the modern world. Plant life, which has also received some attention, sits somewhere between these broad categories. Plants can move and grow, on the one hand, but on the other they cannot see or hear or walk {{in the same way as}} other animals – or at least, we are not accustomed to think of them as doing so in the modern developed West. Instead, plant life appears either as an element of landscape, or as a backdrop for the more important things that humans and animals do, or in commodified form at the base of an <b>ecological</b> <b>pyramid.</b> Notwithstanding, literatures both ancient and modern indicate human knowledge and understanding of plants as beings comparable with humans, with a similar capacity to endure pain, suffering, and loss, in both metaphorical and literal terms. This chapter will offer a case study of the ways in which trees and other plants are represented in Old Norse Eddic poetry. It will examine their presentation as beings who possess sensory and emotional qualities, starting with a discussion of the hardships of the central pillar of Norse cosmology, Yggdrasill, before considering the ways in which the suffering of trees is used as a means of portraying the suffering of humans, and concluding with some reflections on what this evidence suggests about interactions between humans and plants in early medieval Scandinavia...|$|E
40|$|The {{spotlight}} should soon {{shine on}} organic agriculture, {{according to its}} backers. They believe {{that the future of}} food consumption and agricultural practices is organic. True, consumers in industrialised countries have learned to their cost that for years they have been eating veal from calves stuffed full of hormones, beef and beef products from 'mad cows' and chickens that had fed on dioxin; the current craze for organic food is driven in part by a desire to eat safely, and well. But there is also a belief, is there not, that organic practices will save the planet for future generations to feed themselves? Will, and should, ACP farmers and consumers be swept along by the organic wave? In the beginning, all agriculture was organic. Then came the pressure sprayer, the sack of fertiliser and the Green Revolution. And agriculture became intensive, to meet the challenge of feeding mankind. In the end, the <b>ecological</b> <b>pyramid</b> got skewed and pushed off-balance. Any farmer in the world who knows her or his land can tell you that, as Joël de Rosnay 1 put it, 'an ecosystem which is off-balance will spontaneously seek to become more complex, increasing its load of insects and weeds, which farmers in turn will seek to control by increasing their use of pesticides and weed-killers'. Not all farmers do it though. Four out of five farmers in the world, mainly in the South, are subsistence farmers and only have the means to plant their crops and hope that their harvest will feed their family. And one farmer in a hundred, mainly in the North, has deliberately chosen not to use chemical inputs and to sell their organic output to a few well-to-do and well-informed consumers. A question of definition Organic agriculture means that the use of chemically-produced fertilisers and of pesticides against weeds, insects, fungi and bacteria is strictly controlled, if not entirely forbidden. Going organic means going along with the recent guidelines issued by the Codex Alimentarius commission of the FAO: 'organic agriculture which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. In this regard, the greatest possible use of cultivation methods, whether biological or mechanical, is preferred to the application of synthetic products, in order for the overall system to function fully. ' Could it be that many ACP farmers are farming organically anyway, given their lack of resources or information? Could they indeed, naturally, have access to an interesting market opportunity? It is not as clear-cut as that there are several paradoxes and obstacles on the way. Eat more soundly, when you can afford it Eating organically, or put another way, more soundly, is an important concern of consumers in the West. But where do things stand in ACP countries? There are signs of a shift towards organic. The opening of an organic produce market in Dakar, Senegal (see Spore 83) points to a promising niche for some. But such initiatives are very local. The reality is elsewhere : the domestic and regional ACP food market is driven relentlessly by a basic need : people need to eat soundly, but above all in sufficient quantities and cheaply. The export market for organic products is in practice really for the big guys who can invest in the certification process {{that will allow them to}} sell well, and well labelled. You cannot just sell a crop of maize as organic simply because it was grown without chemical fertilisers! To be able to sell organic, you need to have the entire production certified, by an independent body. Such procedures are almost always carried out by organisations in the North, and are costly. Produce more soundly, when you can But the costs of certification are not the only problem to be overcome. A survey by FAO showed that 63 % of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa mentioned the lack of information as the greatest obstacle to adopting organic production. In some cases the techniques are known, but they are too expensive. In 1998, the banana producers of Santo Antão, a small island in the Cape Verde archipelago, met to see how they could increase their production of organic bananas (see Spore 74). They left their meeting disappointed: they would have to invest heavily in importing germplasm which was resistant to viruses, and they could not find any scientific body which had developed a method to biologically control the mil pès, a local insect which attacks the pseudo-stem of the banana plant. Similarly, organic methods are not always compatible with socio-economic aspects of production. In Ghana, coconut production has been significantly increased with the application of mineral fertilisers, at relatively low cost. The same result could be obtained, and in a much more sustainable way, by placing wads of coir around the foot of the coconut trees, instead of selling the coir to mat-makers as is the tradition. Another method which has literally borne fruit is to place animal hornmeal at the foot of young fruit trees. However, there are few farmers who can go without the immediate income they get from selling coir or buffalo horns. The long-term is a luxury indeed Organic agriculture is a long-term affair, but few farmers can wait the two to three years needed for removing chemical residues from their land, for recycling vegetable and animal wastes and for setting up crop rotation systems. Furthermore, tenant farmers are not keen to switch over to organic methods if they are unsure of having access to the land in years to come, when the advantages of organic production will have become tangible. These problems were raised during the fifteenth meeting of the Agricultural Committee of the FAO in January 1999. That body proposed setting up networks for researchers to communicate, promoting regional certification bodies and starting farm schools which could undertake field trials to assess the contribution of organic agriculture to food security. Overtly organic, or simply sound ? In any event, many of the best cultivation methods practised in organic farming (mixed cropping, crop rotation, mulching with organic waste, and combining crops and animal production) are routinely recommended by most agricultural scientists as ways to maximise the sustainability of crop yields. In the north of Côte d Ivoire, for example, the GEPRENAF project for the participatory management of natural resources and fauna has encouraged the local community to build and use compost pits, without explicitly going organic. In the same vein, it makes sense to try to minimise and improve the use of synthetic fertilisers and chemical insecticides. This makes for an agriculture and a range of products which is sound. It is an attractive approach, based simply on a set of best farming practices, and one which appeals to more and more farmers, and to consumers. In many cases, the quality of the products is guaranteed by a system of labelling that states that they have been produced in an area where farmers have committed themselves to certain practices which enhance the hygiene quality, and the taste, of the product. Whether the talk is of organic or of sound, what matters is that there is a clear movement towards an agriculture which is more respectful of all living species, and towards real food. The best news would be to receive confirmation that these methods can indeed feed six billion people on the planet today, with more to come. What has to be permanently kept in mind is the message of André Lwoff, winner of the Nobel prize for medicine in 1965 : 'Something is good when it helps to maintain the entirety, stability and beauty of the biotic community (i. e. the living part of the ecosystem), and when it helps something other than that, it is not good. ' [summary points] Put simply The market for organic produce is a promising one, but it is limited. Organic farming methods carry no miracles, but they do, by and large, help sustainability. Sound agriculture is a way of applying these methods pragmatically, and profitably, for the benefit of the largest possibe number of farmers [...] For further information: Codex Alimentarius Secretariat of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme Food and Agriculture Organization Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 00100 Rome, Italy Fax : + 39 06 5705 4593 Website : www. fao. org IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) c/o Ökozentrum Imsbach 66636 Tholey-Theley, Germany Fax : + 49 6853 - 30110 E-mail : IFOAM@t-online. de Website : [URL] Director of Development at the Centre for Science and Industry of La Villette, France 2 Based on the draft guidelines for the production, processing, labelling and marketing of organically produced foods, 23 rd session of Codex Alimentarius of the FAO, June 1999 The spotlight should soon shine on organic agriculture, according to its backers.
