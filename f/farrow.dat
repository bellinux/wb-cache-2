On 1 April 1942, after training in various places around the United States, the crews and their respective aircraft departed from San Francisco aboard the USS Hornet (CV-8). The mission took place on 18 April. The B-25 which <b>Farrow</b> piloted, named Bat out of Hell, was the sixteenth and final aircraft to depart from the Hornet. After the aircraft's targets in Nagoya, which included an oil tank and aircraft factory, had been bombed, <b>Farrow</b> intended to land in Chuchow.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} and genetic effects on the <b>farrowing</b> interval in Dalland (C- 40) sows in the Southeast of Brazil was studied. Data consisting of 1, 013 <b>farrowing</b> intervals recorded in two herds were analyzed, using a model that included the sire and the dam as random effects and the year of <b>farrowing,</b> the herd and the <b>farrowing</b> season as fixed effects, plus the covariables sow's age at <b>farrowing,</b> litter size at birth, lactation length and weaning-estrus interval. For the <b>farrowing</b> interval first only, variance components were estimated by REML, with an animal model that included, as fixed effect, a contemporary group and, as random effects, the additive genetic variance and the error. The mean <b>farrowing</b> interval was 140. 9 + 5. 7 days, with a 4. 0 % coefficient of variation. Variance analysis showed no effect of either year, season of <b>farrowing</b> or herd on the <b>farrowing</b> interval. The sire effect was not important for the <b>farrowing</b> interval, but the dam represented {{an important source of}} variation. The total number of piglets born and the sow's age at <b>farrowing</b> had no influence on the <b>farrowing</b> interval. The length of lactation exerted an influence on the <b>farrowing</b> interval, accounting for 19. 4 % of the total variation of this trait. Likewise, the linear regression of the weaning-estrus interval in relation to the <b>farrowing</b> interval was highly significant, accounting for 51. 7 % of the total variation. The heritability estimate was 0. 00, suggesting that no genetic gain can be obtained by selection for a shorter <b>farrowing</b> interval...|$|R

The theory of the Duke of Norfolk-based origins of the Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James <b>Farrow,</b> a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the origins of the breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. The letter from the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether pigs with different genetic merit for survival differed in birth weight, progress of <b>farrowing,</b> early postnatal behavior, or rectal temperature within 24 h after birth. On a nucleus farm in Rio Verde, Brazil, information was collected on 280 pigs, originating from 25 litters with known estimated breeding values for pig survival (EBVps). Litters were selected in such a way that a continuous range of EBVps with a maximum genetic contrast was achieved. Birth weight was recorded for all pigs. Indicators for progress of <b>farrowing</b> were birth intervals and duration of <b>farrowing.</b> Behavioral indicators of pig vitality were time until first upright standing (FUS), time until first udder contact (FUC), time until first teat in mouth (FTM), and time until first colostrum uptake (FCU). Rectal temperature was measured within 24 h after birth. <b>Farrowing</b> survival and early postnatal survival (within 3 d after <b>farrowing)</b> were registered. <b>Farrowing</b> survival and early postnatal survival both increased with increasing EBVps (<b>farrowing</b> survival: P = 0. 007; early postnatal survival: P = 0. 027). Birth weight decreased with increasing EBVps (P = 0. 01). Birth intervals tended to increase with increasing EBVps (P = 0. 10) and duration of <b>farrowing</b> was not related to EBVps. Time until first teat in mouth increased with increasing EBVps (P = 0. 05), but the other behavioral indicators of pig vitality were not related to EBVps. Rectal temperature within 24 h after birth was not related to EBVps. Pigs with a higher genetic merit for survival have a lower birth weight but nevertheless have an increased <b>farrowing</b> survival and early postnatal survival. Their increased survival cannot be explained by differences in progress of <b>farrowing,</b> early postnatal behavior, or rectal temperature within 24 h after birth...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} extent of seasonal variation in <b>farrowing</b> rate on commercial pig breeding farms in New Zealand and the influence of some environmental factors on reproductive efficiency. The data comprised monthly <b>farrowing</b> rates covering a two year period and involving five breeding units located in each of four climatic regions ('hot and stable'; 'hot and variable'; 'warm'; and 'cool'). The latter were identified on the basis of mean monthly maximum temperature and mean monthly diurnal temperature fluctuation prevailing during the summer months. Examination of 11, 379 observations revealed an overall <b>farrowing</b> rate of 77. 1 % with the presence of some seasonal variation. Only within the 'hot and stable' region did month of mating significantly influence the <b>farrowing</b> rate. However, in all regions some farms exhibited a considerable decrease in <b>farrowing</b> rate from late spring and summer matings compared with other times of the year. Any possible effect of the regional differences in climate on <b>farrowing</b> rate was overshadowed by marked within-region variation in <b>farrowing</b> rate associated with farms. In support of a farm influence on <b>farrowing</b> rate a subjective classification of housing standards for breeding stock generally placed those with the highest <b>farrowing</b> rate, irrespective of season or location, in the top category, and 'vice versa'.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of different induction protocols when applied on d 114 of gestation. We randomly assigned 118 sows to four treatment groups: single injection of prostaglandin (1 Chi PG), prostaglandin combined with oxytocin 24 hours later (PG+OT), half the dosage of prostaglandin twice with six hours interval (2 Chi 1 / 2 PG), and a control group of which <b>farrowing</b> wasn't induced. All injections were administered intramuscularly in the neck on day 114 of gestation. A significantly higher percentage of sows started <b>farrowing</b> between 22 and 32 hours after induction in the PG+OT-group (68 per cent) and the 2 Chi 1 / 2 PG-group (52 per cent) compared to the control group (23 per cent).
