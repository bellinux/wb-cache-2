Thou shalt perceive the simple shows, the [...] delicate miracles of earth, [...] Dandelions, clover, the <b>emerald</b> <b>grass,</b> the early scents and flowers, [...] The arbutus under foot, the willow's yellow-green, the blossoming [...] plum and cherry; [...] With these the robin, lark and thrush, singing their songs--the [...] flitting bluebird; [...] For such the scenes the annual play brings on.|$|R
5000|$|According to lead vocalist Ivan Moody, {{the song}} was {{inspired}} by rumors that he found on the internet. The rumors purported that Moody committed suicide, that his band broke up, {{and that he was}} a drug addict with fourteen children. At the band's August 27, 2011 Pain in the <b>Grass</b> concert in <b>Emerald</b> City, Washington Moody pointed out that he was alive, his band was still together, and stated that [...] "the kid part might be true, I'm waiting on blood tests, but the only drug I do is green".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Nitrogen (N) is {{the main}} {{nutrient}} responsible for the green coloration of lawns but also stimulates {{the growth of the}} aerial portion of grass, thus increasing mowing expenses. Therefore, herbicides may be used as a growth regulator. The ideal herbicide will reduce lawn height without affecting esthetics. Toward this end, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the green coloration of <b>Emerald</b> <b>grass</b> (Zoysia japonica Steud.) under the effect of different N doses or herbicides used as growth regulators. The study site consisted of randomized blocks containing 20 treatments arranged in a 5 Ã— 4 factorial design with four treatment groups: four herbicides (glyphosate, imazaquin, imazethapyr, and metsulfuron-methyl, accounting for 200, 420, 80, and 140 g ha- 1 of the active ingredient, respectively) and the control sample (no herbicide); and three doses of N in the form of urea (5, 10, and 20 g m- 2), divided into five applications per year, in addition to a treatment without N. Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) was assessed and the aerial portion of the lawn was measured with digital image analysis. Doses of N ranging from 10 to 20 g m- 2, divided into five applications a year, provided the lawn with intense green coloration, and the herbicides glyphosate (200 g ha- 1), imazaquin (420 g ha- 1), and imazethapyr (80 g ha- 1) were reported to be suitable for use as growth regulators of the study species, considering maintenance of esthetic quality (green coloration). The digital image analysis of the aerial portion provided more accurate results than use of a chlorophyll meter with regard to the recommendation of both N dose and herbicides to be used as growth regulators of <b>Emerald</b> <b>grass...</b>|$|R
50|$|Pseudoterpna coronillaria, the Jersey emerald or gorse emerald, is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is known from Spain, Portugal, the Pyrenees, western and {{southern}} France, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Italy, Samos, Rhodes, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, northern Jordan and North Africa. It has not been reported from mainland Great Britain, but is present on Jersey, where it was previously overlooked {{as a form of}} the <b>grass</b> <b>emerald,</b> until 2001 when it was correctly identified.|$|E
6000|$|Sordello now {{undertook}} {{to accompany the}} great Roman poet and his friend to a certain distance on their ascent towards the penal quarters of the mountain; but as evening was drawing nigh, and the ascent could not be made properly in the dark, he proposed that they should await the dawning {{of the next day}} in a recess that overlooked a flowery hollow. The hollow was a lovely spot of ground, enamelled with flowers that surpassed the exquisitest dyes, and green with a <b>grass</b> brighter than <b>emeralds</b> newly broken.[12] There rose from it also a fragrance of a thousand different kinds of sweetness, all mingled into one that was new and indescribable; and with the fragrance there ascended the chant of the prayer beginning [...] "Hail, Queen of Heaven,"[13] which was sung by a multitude of souls that appeared sitting on the flowery sward.|$|R
6000|$|Torbay is a {{place which}} should be as much endeared to the naturalist as to the patriot and to the artist. We cannot gaze on its blue ring of water, and the great {{limestone}} bluffs which bound it {{to the north and}} south, without a glow passing through our hearts, as we remember the terrible and glorious pageant which passed by in the glorious July days of 1588, when the Spanish Armada ventured slowly past Berry Head, with Elizabeth's gallant pack of Devon captains (for the London fleet had not yet joined) following fast in its wake, and dashing into the midst of the vast line, undismayed by size and numbers, while their kin and friends stood watching and praying on the cliffs, spectators of Britain's Salamis. The white line of houses, too, {{on the other side of}} the bay, is Brixham, famed as the landing-place of William of Orange; the stone on the pier-head, which marks his first footsteps on British ground, is sacred in the eyes of all true English Whigs; and close by stands the castle of the settler of Newfoundland, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Raleigh's half-brother, most learned of all Elizabeth's admirals in life, most pious and heroic in death. And as for scenery, though it can boast of neither mountain peak nor dark fiord, and would seem tame enough in the eyes of a western Scot or Irishman, yet Torbay surely has a soft beauty of its own. [...] The rounded hills slope gently to the sea, spotted with squares of <b>emerald</b> <b>grass,</b> and rich red fallow fields, and parks full of stately timber trees. Long lines of tall elms run down to the very water's edge, their boughs unwarped by any blast; here and there apple orchards are bending under their loads of fruit, and narrow strips of water-meadow line the glens, where the red cattle are already lounging in richest pastures, within ten yards of the rocky pebble beach. The shore is silent now, the tide far out: but six hours hence it will be hurling columns of rosy foam high into the sunlight, and sprinkling passengers, and cattle, and trim gardens which hardly know what frost and snow may be, but see the flowers of autumn meet the flowers of spring, and the old year linger smilingly to twine a garland for the new.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have spoken}} of two {{openings}} into the vale. From {{the one to}} the northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on {{a little to the}} north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the <b>emerald</b> <b>grass</b> already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arose from the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light--looking and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards, finally passed through the [...] "depression" [...] (already described) {{in the middle of the}} southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.|$|R
