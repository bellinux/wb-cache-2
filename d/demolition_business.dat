50|$|Goldtooth was {{enrolled}} {{as a student}} at Arizona State University in 1971. with goals towards earning a degree in Industrial Design within the Department of Engineering. He left school enlisting into the U.S. Army in 1973 becoming a Finance and Accounting Specialist within the Army's payroll division. Tom was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington later becoming active in the Army's Human Relations program, with a goal of undoing racism. Tom became a leader organizing Native soldiers to build solidarity in the post-Vietnam era. Tom was honorable discharged in 1976 and already became active in the Puget Sound Native communities in sports, pow-wows and social activities. Tom earned his Associates of Arts (AA) degree from Tacoma Community College (TCC) in Human Services. He was also a Peer Counselor at TCC helping Native students pursue their higher education goals. As a young man, he volunteered as {{a board member of the}} Tacoma Indian Center. It was during this time of his life he made a decision to pursue a social work degree that would help him to work with the social welfare needs of Native American families. After obtaining his AA degree from TCC, he enrolled into the Social Work (Welfare) Program of Pacific Lutheran University, but did not finish his degree upon a decision to move to the Navajo Nation (NN). He was hired as Fort Defiance Regional Bi-State Social Services Director of the NN. His experience in the Puget Sound region of Washington State in American Indian Child Welfare Act hearings and learning from Northwest Coast Native women in the needs for the protection of children and families, Tom provided leadership in strengthening casework in domestic and sexual abuse cases on the Navajo reservation. Following working on the Navajo reservation, Tom moved with his family to the Lower Sioux Community in southwest Minnesota in 1981. He later became the Executive Director of the St. Paul American Indian Center, commuting back and forth from rural Minnesota to St. Paul. Under his leadership he developed the American Indian Family Services program including an Indian foster care program. It was Wilford Gurneau, Red Lake Anishinaabe, that is credited with helping Tom develop Minnesota States' first all-Indian urban foster care program. It was at the St. Paul American Indian Center that Tom developed the Back to Mother Earth Program that would provide opportunity for Native children and parents to re-learn indigenous agricultural ways with urban gardening and taking families into the country to learn cultural ways of building lodges, skinning game animals and tanning and sweat lodge ceremonies. In the mid-80's Tom later formed a residential/commercial small-scale <b>demolition</b> <b>business</b> that recycled deconstruction materials. In 1991 Tom became the Coordinator of the Red Lake Nation environmental program focusing on closing three open landfill dumps. It was during this time that Tom discovered the serious issues with Tribes not having the capacity for implementing needed environmental protection programs on Native lands. In 1991, Tom was selected by Native people attending the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit held on October 24-27, 1991, in Washington DC as the Native spokesperson in the Summit's plenary sessions. This launched Tom's leadership role for years to come in environmental and economic justice within Native lands.Goldtooth currently serves as the Executive Director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, based in Bemidji, Minnesota.|$|E
40|$|New {{products}} are {{launched in the}} market every day, {{this means that the}} companies have to first prepare the launch strategy and then implement it. As a consequence, {{due to the lack of}} experience or a lack of awareness of the importance of the product launch, the product hits the market with a very low impact and of course not bringing profit to the company. Knowing the importance of the product launch, in this project we analyze how the company Hilti, launches the new products with the objective to find out areas of improvement. In order to have the best chances and opinion about Hilti’s product launches, I worked 7 month within the Marketing Team in the Drilling and <b>Demolitions</b> <b>Business</b> Unit. Thus, first of all, we start this project by setting the targets of the product launch which helps to locate the important outputs of a product launch in a direct sales environment. Afterwards, we present all the important topics within a product launch under the theoretical point of view. We believe that knowing what the experts are saying about the different aspects of the product launch will help us to be more consistent during the Hilti product launch analysis. Once the theory is known, we analyze the Hilti product launch process with the objective to compare theory against reality. All the information presented in this project is taken from the launch of one new Hilti product, TE-CX drill bit. Therefore, the quality of the data is assured and together with all the interviews to the Product Managers, the project presents a really realistic product launch. When theory and reality come together, immediately we have to comparison, and consequently the improvement suggestions. Finally, we go back to the beginning and check if the Hilti product launch with the improvement suggestions meet the targets settled in the beginning of the project...|$|R

40|$|The {{demolition}} of building structures produces {{enormous amounts of}} waste materials. In most current demolition projects, {{a great number of}} demolished materials are directly sent to landfill after their primary usage due to the difficulties in finding their next usage immediately. At the same time, because of limited supply of second-hand materials, new and high quality materials are used in construction projects whose design standards can be fitted using the secondary or used materials. However, this is an inefficient method to reduce waste because off the flow nature of the current waste-exchange systems and the demolition procedure. The recent concept using deconstruction rather than destruction for demolishing a constructed facility fails to achieve widespread understanding or acceptance due to various practical limitations. In this paper, for the purpose of envisaging the deconstruction implementations in practice and promoting cascading usages of construction materials, the concept of electronic demolition (e-Demotion, eDemolition) is put forward for the first time. E-demolition is a virtual demolition approach by which the demolition information, progress and outputs are operated before the physical demolition. Furthermore, the authors set up the essential models to implement electronic {{demolition of}} buildings from the viewpoints of <b>demolition</b> progress, <b>business,</b> and information. Each model is demonstrated in accord with the conventional demolition practice and subject to the ideal deconstruction implementation. Following the electronic demolition of a real project, the physical demolition can be anticipated with a minimum of construction waste emission. <br /...|$|R
30|$|To {{elaborate}} the conjectural {{influence of}} institutional framework and protest frames on protest success, we will analyse an anti-demolition case in detail. In this case, {{a teacher who}} was to be relocated {{as a result of}} residential demolition was suspended from job without pay in 2010. From January 25 to 27, 2011, this case was reported by Eastern Morning Post, Xinhua Daily Telegraph, and People’s Court News. Among these reports, Xinhua Daily Telegraph pointed out that demolition of “Zhulian” 7 style is not only an invasion of citizens’ civil rights but also a violation of laws (Shan 2011). On February 1, 2011, People’s Court News pointed out that this event was a covert forced demolition, which violated “Regulations on the Expropriation and Compensation of Houses on State-owned Land (draft)”—a bill that was passed on January 19, 2011; it also contended that such a covert forced demolition had caused tensions between cadres and those affected by the demolition, which had further created grievances among the masses (Wang 2011). At the same time, a new district management committee began investigating this event and later advised that the victim’s salary should be reinstated, an apology be issued, and self-criticism be conducted about the demolition. In relation to this case, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Supervision made an announcement in March 2011. The announcement demanded the strengthening of the supervision of demolition policies, as well as the curbing and correcting of demolition projects that were in violation of rules and regulations. This case shows that mass media are more likely to report anti-demolition protests {{from the perspective of the}} rule of law and their violation following the promulgation of new laws and regulations. It also confirms that the co-presence of the discourse of socialism such as cadre-mass relations and legal discourse (Lee 2000; Tong 2006). Similarly, a case in Jiangxi province clearly demonstrates the effects of protest frames. During an investigation by China Youth Daily, one staff member confidently bragged that “this kind of news regarding demolition incidents would never be publicly reported” (Tu 2008). Yet, when Legal Daily synthesized anti-demolition protestors’ discourse and raised questions about whether the local government should use political resources to service <b>demolition</b> for <b>business</b> development, whether threatening civil servants related to the demolished house units (see “Zhulian”) has any legal base, and the relationship between housing demolition regulations and property law, the local government swiftly responded to such questions (Chen and Li 2008).|$|R
5000|$|In June 1968, {{even before}} the plans from Yale Properties had been finalized, the city gave King Street {{business}} owners six months to vacate the buildings they owned. This came as a shock, since the initial construction start date had been pushed back for years. <b>Demolition</b> of the <b>businesses</b> on the eastern portion of King Street West bounded by James Street North began in late 1968 and was completed by the early summer of 1969. After a hasty ceremony on the barren site that spotlighted local politicians and reiterated the Yale Properties commitment to the modernization of the city, construction hoarding was erected and pillars of concrete quickly followed. Throughout {{the construction of the}} first phase of the civic square, renamed Lloyd D. Jackson Square a year later, unfavourable reviews frequently appeared, some labelling the square [...] "a people's place." [...] Representatives of local disabled organizations also criticized the developer's refusal to add in wheelchair ramps. Yet, on August 22, 1972, thousands of people climbed to the complex's plaza roof and engaged in a massive ceremony that included live music, food and a fireworks show signalling the grand opening of the mall and adjacent Bank of Montreal's commercial pavilion. Although Hamiltonians were absolutely enthralled by the wide selection of trendy new stores and restaurants, and by the sheer size of the space, the optimism was swiftly dampened by operational mismanagement. The treatment of the mall's patrons only worsened when on March 1, 1973, the washrooms were discovered to be a hangout for drug dealers and users. The operations manager Charlie Friedman declared, [...] "There's no law that washrooms must be provided…If the situation doesn't improve we may lock them up." [...] He proceeded to do just that, four days later until, after a week, public outcry forced them open again. Then on October 17, 1973, a woman was jailed for several days after walking her dog inside the mall and becoming belligerent after being forced out. Capitalizing on the growing public disdain towards the rigid management of the plaza, The Hamilton Spectator, which had always favoured the original plan for the city's redevelopment, opened fire on the square's construction with columnist Jim Campbell labelling it a [...] "pigeon place" [...] crowded with too many buildings and bounded by a useless rooftop plaza. The verbal assault continued in the spring of 1974 with opinion columnist Tami Paikin criticizing the lack of grass and open green space, and an unknown writer calling the already rusting buildings [...] "complete eyesores." [...] Soon the complex's high walls of barren concrete and its bland stone rooftop plaza began to generate a feeling of disconnection between the citizens and the square. The initial sense of pride in the project soon withered and paved the way for vandalism as the square continued to expand throughout the 1970s.|$|R
