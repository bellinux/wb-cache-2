40|$|The loss of {{telomere}} function {{can result}} in the fusion of telomeres with other telomeric loci, or non-telomeric double-stranded DNA breaks. Sequence analysis of fusion events between short dysfunctional telomeres in human cells has revealed that fusion {{is characterized by a}} distinct molecular signature consisting of extensive deletions and micro-homology at the <b>fusion</b> <b>points.</b> This signature is consistent with alternative error-prone end-joining processes. We have examined the role that Mre 11 may play in the fusion of short telomeres in human cells; to do this, we have analysed telomere fusion events in cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) patients that exhibit hypomorphic mutations in MRE 11. The telomere dynamics of ATLD fibroblasts were indistinguishable from wild-type fibroblasts and they were proficient in the fusion of short telomeres. However, we observed a high frequency of insertion of DNA sequences at the <b>fusion</b> <b>points</b> that created localized sequence duplications. These data indicate that Mre 11 plays a role in the fusion of short dysfunctional telomeres in human cells and are consistent with the hypothesis that as part of the MRN complex it serves to stabilize the joining complex, thereby controlling the fidelity of the fusion reaction...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, the {{findings}} of the present study revealed a complex but constant architecture of a three-layered quadriceps tendon which is formed by six elements. These are 1. lateral aponeurosis of the vastus intermedius, 2. deep and 3. superficial medial aponeurosis of the vastus intermedius, 4. vastus lateralis, 5. tensor vastus intermedius and 6. rectus femoris. These elements of the extensor apparatus join each other proximal to the patella in a complex onion-like architecture. Its two-layered intermediate layer shows variable <b>fusions</b> <b>points.</b> The vastus medialis contributes to the quadriceps tendon with its medial insertion into all layers of the quadriceps tendon. Further studies are needed to translate the anatomical findings into clinical relevance in patellofemoral pathology or knee surgery.|$|R
50|$|Chamotte {{is made by}} {{calcining}} {{fire clay}} (Al2O3-SiO2) above 1100 C. Its <b>fusion</b> <b>point</b> is 1750 C and has low thermal expansion. It is the second cheapest sand, however it is still twice as expensive as silica. Its disadvantages are very coarse grains, which result in a poor surface finish, and it is limited to dry sand molding. Mold washes are used to overcome the surface finish problem. This sand is usually used when casting large steel workpieces.|$|E

Because of these good properties {{it is commonly used}} when casting alloy steels and other expensive alloys. It is also used as a mold wash (a coating applied to the molding cavity) to improve surface finish. However, it is expensive and not readily available.|$|E
50|$|Artificial glass {{sometimes}} crystallizes {{and contains}} spherulites {{that may be}} {{as large as a}} marble. As the glass has little similarity in chemical composition to volcanic obsidians, these spherulites when analyzed throw little light on the mineral nature of spherulites in rocks. They show, however, that in viscous semi-solid glasses near their <b>fusion</b> <b>point</b> crystallization tends to nucleate at certain centers and to spread outwards, producing spherulitic structures. Many salts and organic substances exhibit the same tendency, yielding beautiful spherulite crystallizations when melted and cooled rapidly on a microscopic slide.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the timing of DNA replication is coordinated across megabase-scale domains in metazoan genomes, yet the importance of this aspect of genome organization is unclear. Here we show that replication timing is remarkably conserved between human and mouse, uncovering large regions that may have been governed by similar replication dynamics since these species have diverged. This conservation is both tissue-specific and independent of the genomic G+C content conservation. Moreover, we show that time of replication is globally conserved despite numerous large-scale genome rearrangements. We systematically identify rearrangement <b>fusion</b> <b>points</b> and demonstrate that replication time can be locally diverged at these loci. Conversely, rearrangements are shown to be correlated with early replication and physical chromosomal proximity. These results suggest that large chromosomal domains of coordinate...|$|R

During each data gathering cycle, the sensor nodes use multihopping to communicate with their respective cluster heads, while the cluster heads perform data fusion, and transmit the aggregated data directly to the aircraft. We formulate and solve a cost based optimization problem to determine the optimum number of sensor nodes (n 0), cluster head nodes (n 1) and the battery energy in each type of nodes (E 0 and E 1 respectively) to ensure at least T data gathering cycles. We observe that the number of cluster heads required, n 1, scales approximately as n 0 1 â k 4 where k is the propagation loss exponent. ...|$|R
