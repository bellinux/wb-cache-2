5|$|Because the A82 is a main through route, {{tourists}} are suggested {{to use the}} older Military Road instead, {{so as to avoid}} the coach and <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic.</b> Cyclists and walkers can use the Great Glen Way between Fort Wiilam and Inverness. This is part of National Cycle Route 78 (The Caledonia Way) from Campbeltown to Inverness.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} on the A340 road, and has nearby access to the A4 road and the M4 motorway. Newbury Buses route 104 serves the village, with {{services}} terminating in Newbury, Calcot and Reading. The 2005 Parish Plan identified {{a need for a}} relief road near the village. A report was presented in 2009 evaluating the problems caused by <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> through the village, and described solutions which included support from Newbury MP Richard Benyon.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December 2006 the Port Tunnel {{which carries}} traffic {{from the port}} and onto the {{motorway}} close to the M50/M1 interchange was opened {{as the first step}} of an eastern bypass to Dublin, making the M1 junctions 1 to 3 part of the M50. Though originally intended to be a two-lane single-bore system catering specifically to <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic,</b> the Port Tunnel was built to motorway standard as two separate tunnels to cater for all traffic (although <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> is not tolled). The tunnels are deeper than originally planned to reduce disturbance to residential areas, and were built one kilometre longer and with more ancillary works to facilitate this. Since February 2007, 5-axle vehicles are prohibited from travelling within the city centre cordon between 7:00 and 19:00 Monday to Sunday (unless the vehicle has obtained a valid permit for necessary deliveries from the [...] ).|$|E
50|$|In 1996 the UK Cyclists' Touring Club and the Institute of Highways and Transportation jointly {{produced}} {{a set of}} Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure guidelines that placed segregated cycling facilities {{at the bottom of}} the hierarchy of measures designed to promote cycling. Planners at the Directorate Infrastructure Traffic and Transport in Amsterdam place cyclists and motorists together on roads with speed limits at or below 30 km/h, and segregate them through bicycle lanes at higher limits. This is in a context where most of the measures prioritised by Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure (<b>HGV</b> restrictions, area-wide <b>traffic</b> calming, speed limit enforcement etc.) are already in place - see Utility cycling for more detail.|$|R
40|$|In {{urban areas}} where {{roadworks}} are required, single lane shuttle operation is applied, especially {{where there is}} limited road space. There are operational problems relating to the site such as site geometry, visibility, length of roadworks zone, position of signs with other traffic control devices and signal timing. Other problems are mainly related to drivers ‟ behaviour and their compliance with traffic controls on site. The reduced road width caused by the works will interrupt {{the free flow of}} traffic and it can also add to the risks to road users. In addition, shuttle operation may introduce long queues and increase delays especially during peak periods. There is a need to identify those parameters and behaviours which might influence traffic performance in terms of safety and capacity. An investigation of four roadworks sites in urban roadworks within the Greater Manchester area was undertaken for this purpose. Parameters included in the examination were position of the STOP sign, signal timing, weather conditions, time headway, vehicle speed and percentages of heavy goods vehicles (<b>HGV)</b> in the <b>traffic</b> stream. Statistical analysis and comparisons between sites were conducted. Other factors related to the operation of the shuttle-lane were provided based on site observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) on merging behaviour and on mental workload of motorists during filtering in and out of traffic were studied. Participants drove in a driving simulator in a total of 12 conditions; twice in each of two weather conditions and in three traffic conditions. The weather conditions were clear weather and foggy weather. The traffic conditions were without HGVs (i. e. only private cars), the current mix of HGVs and private cars, and a condition with a 70 % increase of HGVs leading to an HGV column in the slow lane. The focus of the study was on assessing effects on behaviour and mental workload during filtering into traffic, and during exiting from the motorway. During the experiment driving performance was registered, behaviour was observed, self reports were collected, and the participant's heart rate was recorded. The results showed that directly after filtering into traffic the variation in driving speed increased and the minimum time headway decreased with an increase in the proportion of <b>HGVs.</b> Joining motorway <b>traffic</b> was considered to involve greater effort and risk in the condition with a column of HGVs. The effects of the conditions on heart rate are less clear, although the moment when the participants joined the traffic is clearly visible. The effects of weather conditions were limited, drivers adapting their driving behaviour in adverse weather by reducing speed. To exit the motorway is not a difficult manoeuvre. For that reason the lane change from the left hand to the fight hand lane that preceded the exit was analysed. Although increased mental effort was reported and the lane change was visible in the heart rate record, no critical changes as a result of increase in proportion of HGVs were found for this manoeuvre. However, in the condition with a column of HGVs, the exit that had to be taken was most frequently missed as HGVs obstructed the view of the exit signs. It is concluded that an increase in HGVs will make merging into traffic more mentally demanding and will decrease safety margins...|$|R

The road {{is an essential part of}} the transport infrastructure of King's Lynn as it links King's Lynn Docks and its industrial estates to the A149 Queen Elizabeth way King's Lynn by-pass, allowing <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> to reach the A47 main trunk road without passing through the centre of King's Lynn.|$|E
50|$|The rate of {{corrosion}} and {{weakening of}} the main cables would have required the bridge to close to <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> some time around 2014 and then close to all traffic by 2019, so plans were drawn up to build a replacement crossing, to run parallel to the existing road bridge between Lothian and Fife. Dehumidification equipment was installed to remove moisture {{from the inside of}} the main suspension cables, in an attempt to slow or halt the corrosion, but with no guarantee of success, the Forth Estuary Transport Authority and Scottish Government were left with no option but to plan {{the construction of a new}} crossing.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of traffic is local, agricultural and, in season, holiday traffic. North of the A40 {{there is more}} <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> owing to restrictions preventing large vehicles from exiting Fishguard to the north; this traffic must leave Fishguard {{to the south and}} use the A40/A478 to access the A487 for Cardigan and points north. In 2012 Pembrokeshire County Council said the A478 at New Hedges, near Tenby, carried an average of 9,900 vehicles a day. There were 10 deaths as a result of road accidents on the A478 between 1999 and 2010, more than 10% of the road deaths in Pembrokeshire (80) in that period.|$|E
50|$|On 24 June 2015 Operation Stack was {{implemented}} due to industrial action taken by French {{employees of the}} MyFerryLink company, {{as a result of}} disagreements regarding the imminent takeover of the company by DFDS. This has been the first ever incident which has seen the implementation of Phase 4 of Operation Stack, which involves closing the M20 from Junctions 9 to 11 coast-bound, meaning that continent-bound <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> was stacked all the way from Junction 8 at Hollingbourne, southeast of Maidstone, to Junction 12 at Cheriton, near Folkestone. Operation Stack began to be removed from 3 July onwards, with more than 30 miles of parked HGVs needing to be cleared. The cost to the United Kingdom economy was estimated at around £250 million.|$|E
50|$|Ardfert has {{developed}} around a crossroads of local roads and the Tralee-Ballyheigue regional road. There is therefore, a considerable level of through traffic, and its infrastructure {{needs to be}} better planned and developed. This situation {{is compounded by the}} quarry to the north east of the village which generates significant <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> movements through the village. During the summer months the situation is exacerbated by through traffic to coastal locations. The Tralee-Ballyheigue Road at the northern end of the village is too narrow to allow traffic to flow freely and the consequent bottleneck delays traffic {{into and out of the}} village. The building line of existing development does not allow for the widening of the road. In order to reduce traffic congestion, through traffic must be diverted around the village. Existing footpaths are segmented and piecemeal and pavements are not provided throughout the entire plan area. The majority of the plan lands are within 800 metres or ten minutes walk of the village centre. There is therefore excellent potential to encourage pedestrian and cyclist activity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research aiming to forecast the course of business-as-usual (BAU) trends in logistics and related environmental impacts within the UK. A series of seven focus group discussions with supply chain experts has resulted in the identification of the key logistics trends likely to affect the supply chains in the future. A spreadsheet model has been developed which simulates the relationship between economic growth and a series of freight transport-related externalities, including CO 2 emissions, air pollution, noise and congestion and attaches the monetary values to them. The total external costs of road freight transport in the UK have been estimated at £ 7. 2 billion. Furthermore, the taxes paid by the HGV-users in Britain should increase by around 10 per cent to internalise the externalities associated with air pollution, noise, accidents and damage to the infrastructure caused by the lorry transport. However, an increase by as much as 79 per cent would be needed to fully cover all the externalities, including congestion, related to the <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic...</b>|$|E
40|$|Lane {{utilization}} represents how {{the rate}} of traffic flow is distributed among the available number of lanes in a given section. This utilization or split is affected by several factors including traffic flow rates {{as well as the}} presence and amount of heavy goods vehicles within the traffic. The importance of studying lane utilization {{comes from the fact that}} it is one of the input parameters for any traffic micro-simulation models which are increasingly being used in order to assess and suggest solutions for traffic problems. This paper uses two sources of data to model lane utilization including "Motorway Incident detection and Automatic Signaling" MIDAS data and individual vehicles raw data. The latter source of data is specifically used to model how heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are distributed between motorway lanes as flow increases since MIDAS data does not specify the proportions of HGVs by lanes. It is found that the developed models could represent real data in a more efficient way than other previous models. The development of lane utilization models for <b>HGV</b> <b>traffic</b> will help in providing more realistic predictions of traffic behavior when represented by micro-simulation models and in the assessment of such commercial vehicles using the lanes when it comes to pavement design...|$|E
