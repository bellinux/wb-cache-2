40|$|This interpretive {{qualitative}} study investigated why open and distance learning (ODL) within some <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> universities seemingly {{failed to achieve}} high participation rates, compared to the face-to-face mode of delivery in the same institution. Its scope was the Botswana higher education sector. The University of Botswana (UB), the only public <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> university in Botswana, was closely studied. The main question explored why some <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> universities in southern Africa enrolled lower figures through ODL than the face-to-face mode of delivery, though ODL had more potential to increase access substantially than the face-to-face mode. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Purposive selection drew participants from UB, the Tertiary Education Council (TEC) and the Ministry of Education and Skills Development (MOESD), based on their experience in education planning, policy formulation and ODL delivery. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis. The study confirmed internal and external attitudes that create equivalency challenges and impede ODL growth in <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> universities, resulting in its limited contribution to participation. It established that <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> institutions need relevant policies, structures and enhanced resources for ODL, in order to significantly increase participation. The study consequently advocates thorough planning for a <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> setup, commitment of resources, monitored implementation and appropriately trained staff. gv 201...|$|R

We show that a <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> system can significantly outperform a single mode (infrastructure) system when the degree of locality is high.

40|$|International audienceAIM: To compare muscle {{activity}} of lower limb muscles between <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> whole-body vibration (WBV) and the commonly used side-alternating mode. METHODS: Thirty physically active volunteers performed static squats at a knee angle of 60 ° (0 °: knee fully extended) on the WBV platform while surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured of the vastus lateralis (VL), the biceps femoris (BF), and the soleus (SOL). The side-alternating WBV trial was induced at a frequency of 6 Hz and an amplitude (displacement from baseline to peak) of 2. 5 mm. <b>Dual</b> <b>mode</b> WBV consisted of side-alternating vibration with additional circular vibration in the horizontal plane with frequencies of 14 Hz and 43 Hz. Root mean {{square of the}} sEMG signals (sEMGRMS) was calculated after withdrawal of the excessive spikes in the sEMG spectrum via linear interpolation. Then, sEMGRMS was normalized to the sEMGRMS during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Finally, sEMGRMS during a control trial without vibration was subtracted from the trials with WBV in order to isolate the increase in muscle activity due to the vibration. RESULTS: Increase in sEMGRMS of the VL and BF was significantly greater during <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> compared to side-alternating WBV when the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> trial consisted of the high circular frequency (43 Hz, P < 0. 01, Figure 1). In the SOL, the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> enhanced muscle activity significantly compared to the side-alternating mode for both circular vibration frequencies (14 Hz, 43 Hz, P < 0. 01, Figure 1). CONCLUSION: <b>Dual</b> <b>mode</b> WBV resulted in significantly higher muscle activity in select lower limb muscles than the commonly used side-alternating mode. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> platforms be considered for future WBV protocols in order to optimize the training stimulus in the lower limbs...|$|R

40|$|CANA) is an {{efficient}} way to support <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> systems, [1]. A <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> of operation has been introduced in the traditional 5 GHz HiperLAN/ 2 to allow data off-loading by using resources of an ad-hoc network created at 60 GHz (the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> concept was introduced by the IST BroadWay project, IST- 2001 - 32686). The off-loading is possible using CANA but certain changes in the standard HiperLAN/ 2 protocol stack are required and certain algorithms need to be incorporated. In this paper, the new enhanced protocol stack of HiperLAN/ 2 that supports CANA is presented as well as key algorithms that need to be developed and whose performance is crucial for the efficient utilization of the system resources. These algorithms can also be implemented for any other WLAN in order to support a second mode of operation. Simulations shed light into the trade-offs induced by the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> of operation and the way the network resources may efficiently be utilized under certain conditions...|$|R
