40|$|High-rise {{buildings}} {{require the}} installation of complex elevator group control systems (EGCS). In vertical transportation, when a passenger makes a <b>hall</b> <b>call</b> by pressing a landing <b>call</b> <b>button</b> installed at the floor and located near the cars of the elevator group, the EGCS must allocate one of the cars of the group to the <b>hall</b> <b>call.</b> We develop a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm {{to deal with this}} car-call allocation problem. The PSO algorithm is compared to other soft computing techniques such as genetic algorithm and tabu search approaches that have been proved as efficient algorithms for this problem. The proposed PSO algorithm was tested in high-rise buildings from 10 to 24 floors, and several car configurations from 2 to 6 cars. Results from trials show that the proposed PSO algorithm results in better average journey times and computational times compared to genetic and tabu search approaches...|$|R

40|$|Traditional <b>call</b> <b>button</b> {{networks}} that control elevator systems utilize a wired connection for communication. The communication cables are {{run through the}} elevator shaft from one <b>call</b> <b>button</b> to another and finally to the controller on the roof. Installing this wired link is highly time consuming. In this thesis, we propose the design for a wireless <b>call</b> <b>button</b> network. Two important features of this wireless network design are low cost and low power consumption. Controller Area Network (CAN) is a widely used protocol for wired networks and has been proposed for use in next generation elevator control systems. A modified CAN for wireless (MCANW) protocol has been developed for the wireless <b>call</b> <b>button</b> network. The wireless link will be implemented via the use of data radios. A modified form of traditional Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation scheme for the radios is proposed. The proposed modulation scheme, like differential BPSK, can be detected non-coherently but it offers better performance than differential BPSK. Its implementation includes an innovative tracking algorithm to maintain synchronization at the receiver...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} problem in {{vertical}} transportation using elevator group appears when a passenger wants {{to travel from}} a floor to other different floor in a building. The passenger makes a <b>hall</b> <b>call</b> by pressing a landing <b>call</b> <b>button</b> installed at the floor and located near the cars of the elevator group. After that, the elevator controller receives the call and identifies {{which one of the}} elevators in the group is most suitable to serve the person having issued the call. In this paper, we have developed different elevator group controllers based on genetic and tabu search algorithms. Even though genetic algorithm has been previously considered in vertical transportation problems, the use of tabu search approaches is a novelty in vertical transportation and has not been considered previously. Tests have been carried out for high-rise buildings considering diverse sizes in the group of cars. Results indicate that the waiting time and journey time of passengers were significantly improved when dealing with such soft computing approaches. Also, a quickly evaluable solution quality function in the algorithms allows suitable computational times for industry implementation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an optimal control strategy for elevator group in large buildings. An elevator group controller allocates different elevators to {{up and down}} <b>hall</b> <b>calls</b> that coming from different floors. The control strategy is a precondition to minimize mainly the average waiting time of <b>hall</b> <b>calls.</b> In this paper, two genetic algorithms are developed to treat efficiently the elevator group problem. The first one handles the set of up and down <b>hall</b> <b>calls</b> while their destination floors are unknown at this moment. The second one handles the <b>hall</b> <b>calls</b> in assuming that their destination floors are known. The simulation results of the proposed algorithms gave a superior performance to that obtained with a traditional control in the industry (duplex algorithm). Copyright © 2005 IFA...|$|R
