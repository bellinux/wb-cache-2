500|$|The green-head ant {{is known}} for its rarity of virgin queens, with some nests {{occasionally}} producing winged females; queens are able to establish their own colonies in captivity, but out in the wild they have never been seen to establish a colony, suggesting that the species is losing its queen caste. The majority of observations show males mating with workers, but not queens. One factor further suggesting the loss of the queen caste is that the green-head ant is going through an evolutionary process where queens are a rare morphological form with little significance, so workers usually replace the queens and take on the reproductive role. Queens still undertake the role of nuptial flight as some have been seen mating with males. They are known to release a sex pheromone from the pygidial gland, an exocrine gland found between the last two abdominal segments. The ergatoid (wingless reproductive females) queens emerge from their nest and, like the workers, appress their head onto the ground and elevate their gaster, from which the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membrane</b> {{at the back of the}} abdomen extends. The queens then release the sex pheromones, which attracts the males, who frantically search for the queens through agitated locomotion. The males may attempt to copulate with workers that did not [...] "call" [...] for them, suggesting that workers might be able to release these pheromones. When a male makes contact with a queen, the male touches her with his antennae and grasps the female's thorax with his mandibles. A queen is ready to mate when she turns her abdomen to the side, where the male will search for the genitalia with his copulatory apparatus (parts of the organ involved with copulation). The pair may copulate for several minutes.|$|E

50|$|The {{lifecycle}} of V. jacobsoni in A. cerana {{begins with}} a mature mated female entering a larval cell of a honey bee. Once the cell is capped, the adult female mite hides for five days inside the larval food {{near the bottom of}} the cell. After about five hours, the mite is released from the food, where it then begins feeding on the host's haemolymph. After 60 hours, the adult female mite lays its first egg on the wall of the cell. Unfertilised mite eggs produce male offspring, that are able to mate with the female offspring. The adult mated female then emerges from the cell with the emerging bee. Once mites are released to the environment, they are transferred to other bees through close contact. The adult female mites then feed through the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membrane</b> on honeybee haemolymph. The cycle is then completed.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{parasitic}} nature, D. adulterina possesses a modified stinger {{that contributes to}} its needs. Specifically upon examination of female specimens, {{it was noted that}} their capacity for combat was higher than the average host species. The cuticle of the stinger is thicker than average and is curved. These modifications allow for D. adulterina to effectively penetrate the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes</b> of the host. D. adulterina are better equipped defensively as well. The abdominal sclerites are closer together, providing a smaller gap for incoming stingers to penetrate, thereby decreasing chances of injury.|$|R
50|$|X. pubescens have glands {{that are}} vital in their exocrine system {{and play a}} large part in communication. One {{category}} of glands is the intersegmental glands, {{also known as the}} yellow glands. The intersegmental glands are made up of several gland pairs in the abdomen, which open up into the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes.</b> These glands distinguish non-nesting bees from bees that are actively breeding. In non-nesting bees they are compact and white. They increase in size and turn from white to yellow as breeding season progresses. Unicellular secretory elements in these glands empty through a duct into the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes,</b> from which the chemicals are released. The other important glands, especially for communication, is the Dufour's gland. The original role of these glands in various bee species was to produce the brood cell lining, but this function does not exist in Xylocopa species. Instead, these glands are responsible for the production of scent marking pheromones. These are strictly hydrocarbons in X. pubescens, and are used to mark flowers that have been previously visiting on foraging trips in order to avoid them. These scent markings on previously visited flowers are recognized both by X. pubescens and X. sulcatipes, which allows the two species to be more efficient in foraging. This system of scent marking is also involved in nest recognition.|$|R
50|$|P. annularis is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to P. bahamensis. To distinguish P. annularis from P. bahamensis, one should notice that P. annularis has no yellow mark on its mesopleuron and usually also has no yellow apical tergum band. In addition, its mesosomal yellow markings show less development. Within the P. annularis species, reproductives and foundresses can be readily distinguished, as well. Reproductive females can be recognized visually because their wings are unworn, since they do not forage much (unlike the workers). In their abdominal cavities, large amounts of white-colored fat are stored beneath the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membrane.</b> Foundresses can be discriminated from workers {{on the basis of}} their differential behaviors. Nests can be identified by their paper material and the way their cells are openly exposed to the external environment. P. annularis is also classified as a primitively eusocial wasp, which means that all individuals develop the capacity to reproduce over their lifetimes, whether or not they actually do so.|$|E

30|$|Most entomopathogenic fungi {{enter in}} the host by {{penetrating}} through the host cuticle. In the course of fungal infection, the fungi are adsorbed on the host cuticle in the first step before penetration (Urquiza and Keyhani 2013). Dong et al. (2009) proposed adhesion to occur at three successive stages: (1)adsorption of the fungi propagules to the cuticular surface; (2)adhesion or consolidation of the interface between pre-germinant propagules and the epicuticle; (3)fungi germination and development at the insect cuticular surface, until appressoria are developed to start the penetration stage. Infection will proceed after a successful penetration being achieved. In addition, we found <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membrane</b> and hair was the first spot invaded by M. anisopliae when R. ferrugineus larvae were infected by this entomopathogenic fungus (Fig.  1). This {{could be attributed to}} relatively thin chitin layers in the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membrane,</b> which favored infection by germ tubes. During the cultivation of dead larvae on moist sterile filter paper, white hypha first occurred at the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membrane</b> and hair associated with most abundant conidia, as well as longest germ tubes and hyphae.

50|$|Cataglyphis ants {{are wary}} of these minute {{parasitoid}} wasps and, when detected, fend them off using mandibles or with the middle and rear pairs of legs as the wasps appear from the rear. On their part, Kollasmosoma wasps fly rapidly and approach from behind. Cataglyphis ants typically hold their metasoma at an angle which ranges from the horizontal to vertically upward, the latter position being characteristic for the genus. The wasps oviposit on the dorsal or ventral surface of the metasoma, and rarely on the abdominal apex, manoeuvring their body so that the ovipositor thrusts along the posterior-anterior axis of the ant body, a behaviour {{which suggests that the}} wasp aims to pierce through the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Adult {{males of}} most species acquire an inflated, bladder-like abdomen {{at the final}} molt. Their {{abdominal}} segments consist of a thin, semitransparent integument, and are enlarged in length and width, while the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes</b> are much reduced. Males are capable of producing loud calls, a long and very deep rasping noise, which members of their species can detect from 2 km away. Males call by stridulating the rasp on the inner surface of their rather weak hind femur against an opposing rasp on the third tergite of the inflated, hollow abdomen. These sclerotized abdominal ridges form a crescent-like row, and their exact number has some value in distinguishing between taxa. In species without an inflated body, these characters are only vestigial. The wings of males have a primitive morphology, and are not suited to producing sound.

40|$|Reflex {{bleeding}} is {{an effective}} defensive mechanism against predators. When attacked, some insects emit hemolymph, which coagulates, quickly entangling their aggressor. Bleeding occurs at weak <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes</b> or through dedicated organs, which can be associated or not with glandular cells.

50|$|Soon after a fly dies from {{infection}} with this pathogenic fungus, large primary conidia are produced {{at the apex}} of a conidiophore which emerge from the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes.</b> When the spores are mature they are forcibly ejected and may fall onto flies resting nearby.

The mycelium of the fungus may grow into an area of the brain that controls the behaviour of the fly, forcing it to land on a surface and crawl upwards. The hyphae gradually grow through the whole of the body, digesting the guts, and the fly dies in about five to seven days. When it is critically ill, it tends to crawl to a high point, straighten its hind legs and open its wings, a behaviour that ensures that the fungal spores are dispersed as widely as possible. Some three hours later, conidiophores start to develop and a new shower of conidia is initiated.|$|R

Abnormal patterns {{were examined in}} the puparial stage: 75 (Series AA) larvae with dorsal or lateral abnormality were classified and the larval abnormality compared with the pattern of abdominal segmentation in the emerging adult fly; another 75 (Series aa) larvae were examined in dorsal, lateral and ventral aspect with respect to segmental abnormality and again in relation to abnormality in the adult. It was observed (i) that the pattern of abdominal <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes</b> is not necessarily maintained through metamorphosis and may regulate to normal; (ii) that tergal abnormalities in the adult result from a failure of correct bilateral fusion of corresponding contralateral hemitergites; (iii) that reduction or displacement of scleral structures in an adult abdominal segment is correlated with deficiency or displacement of epidermal muscle insertions, and hence presumably with the histoblast anlagen which are normally associated with them. In the case of dorsal abnormalities, hemitergite differentiation is normal. Larval abdominal abnormality patterns point to the mode of bilateral morphogenesis of the germbands in embryogenesis. The relation of adult to larval abnormalities suggests some similar independence of contralateral hemisegments at metamorphosis.

Nanocladius (P.) sp. has a univoltine life cycle in Catamaran Brook, with emergence occurring nearly simultaneously with the stonefly host in late May and early June. The chironomid larva constructs a silken case on the stonefly nymphs and feeds on hemolymph by piercing the gill tissue or the <b>intersegmental</b> <b>membranes.</b> Stoneflies were {{collected from}} different habitat types in 4 stream reaches from the headwaters to the mouth, and the position and number of attached chironomids was recorded for each nymph. The frequency and density of parasitic chironomids {{was not related to}} habitat type, but was related to reach; significantly more larvae/host were found in mid-catchment reaches than at the headwaters or mouth (p < 0. 05). No parasitized stoneflies were found in the headwater reach, but between 80 and 100 % of mature stonefly nymphs collected from the mid-catchment and mouth reaches were parasitized. Mean chironomid densities ((x) over bar +/- SE) were 6. 7 +/- 0. 4 chironomids/mature host in the fail of 1994 and 3. 5 +/- 0. 44 in the summer and fall of 1995. Both frequency and density of chironomids were highest on the oldest stonefly age class present; younger stoneflies were also parasitized, but at significantly lower levels. Larval positioning on stoneflies differed with age of larvae; early instar chironomids attached mainly to the thoracic pleura, just under the wingpads, but most migrated to femora by early fall (September), and overwintered on the femora...|$|R
