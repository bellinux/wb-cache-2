40|$|Closed form {{analytical}} expressions {{are obtained}} for predicting the limited rate of reactant conversion in a binary {{reaction of the}} type F + rO yields (1 + r) Product in unpremixed homogeneous turbulence. These relations are obtained {{by means of a}} single point Probability Density Function (PDF) method based on the Amplitude Mapping Closure. It is demonstrated that with this model, the maximum rate of the reactants' decay can be conveniently expressed in terms of definite integrals of the Parabolic Cylinder Functions. For the cases with complete initial segregation, it is shown that the results agree very closely with those predicted by employing a Beta density of the first kind for an appropriately defined Shvab-Zeldovich scalar variable. With this assumption, the final results can also be expressed in terms of closed form analytical expressions which are based on the <b>Incomplete</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>Functions.</b> With both models, the dependence of the results on the stoichiometric coefficient and the equivalence ratio can be expressed in an explicit manner. For a stoichiometric mixture, the analytical results simplify significantly. In the mapping closure, these results are expressed in terms of simple trigonometric <b>functions.</b> For the <b>Beta</b> density model, they are in the form of Gamma Functions. In all the cases considered, the results are shown to agree well with data generated by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). Due to the simplicity of these expressions and because of nice mathematical features of the Parabolic Cylinder and the <b>Incomplete</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>Functions,</b> these models are recommended for estimating the limiting rate of reactant conversion in homogeneous reacting flows. These results also provide useful insights in assessing the extent of validity of turbulence closures in the modeling of unpremixed reacting flows.
