5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century.

Although 17th-century midwives recommended {{to men and women}} that women should aspire to achieve orgasms to help them get pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, notably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E
5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased {{with the emergence of}} a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on {{the contents of the}} human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

5|$|In music, birdsong has {{influenced}} composers and musicians in several ways: {{they can be}} inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi and Beethoven did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Ottorino Respighi; or as Beatrice Harrison did in 1924 with a nightingale, and David Rothenberg did in 2000 with a laughingthrush, they can duet with birds.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's primary {{obligation}} as imperial mathematician {{was to provide}} astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took {{a dim view of}} the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines.

5|$|The {{early years}} of the twentieth century saw tone {{clusters}} elevated to central roles in pioneering works by ragtime artists Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin. In the 1910s, two classical avant-gardists, composer-pianists Leo Ornstein and Henry Cowell, were recognized as making the first extensive explorations of the tone cluster. During the same period, Charles Ives employed them in several compositions that were not publicly performed until the late 1920s or 1930s. Composers such as Béla Bartók and, later, Lou Harrison and Karlheinz Stockhausen became proponents of the tone cluster, which feature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> many 20th- and 21st-century classical composers. Tone clusters play a significant role, as well, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> free jazz musicians such as Cecil Taylor and Matthew Shipp.|$|E
5|$|The {{hermeneutic}} {{style is}} {{a style of}} Latin in the later Roman and early Medieval periods characterised by the extensive use of unusual and arcane words, especially derived from Greek. The style is first found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Apuleius in the second century, and then in several late Roman writers. In the early medieval period, some leading Continental scholars were exponents, including Johannes Scotus Eriugena and Odo of Cluny.|$|E
