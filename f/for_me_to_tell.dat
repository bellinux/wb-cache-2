I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble—she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you.|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV in 2006, vocalist Taylor said that Come What(ever) May was {{a return to the}} roots of the band, stating it is [...] "a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992". He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor. Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album, saying that they are [...] "about never forgetting where you came from, who you are and why you do this." ...|$|E

In mid-July, McCain, regarding whether states such as California {{should be permitted to}} set tough greenhouse gas limits on vehicles, that [...] "It's hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> states that they can't impose ... whatever standards that would apply within their own states."

5000|$|The German {{rock group}} Unloved uses the phrase [...] "heading nod" [...] in the {{corresponding}} {{song from the}} 2006 album Killersongs {{as a metaphor for}} dealing with unpardonable guilt.

2500|$|The {{number of}} auditioners {{increased}} significantly after {{the success of}} the Season 1, and arenas and stadia started to be used to hold the first auditions from this season onwards when the Rose Bowl in Pasadena was used this season instead of the hotel originally planned. [...] Around 70,000 attended the auditions this season and 234 were selected to proceed on to the Hollywood round. [...] Radio DJ Angie Martinez was originally signed up as a fourth judge, but quit after a few days, stating that [...] "it became too uncomfortable <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> someone else to give up on their dream".

2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long enough <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and {{my job is to}} enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added hope that if the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg you to send me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you to keep it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress {{you want to}} get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20/20 {{also asked}} Black Swan editor Andy Weisblum for {{his take on}} the math. He responded that [...] "there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, {{and then the rest}} are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. I mean, she did most of the other shots. It was {{sometimes}} hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
