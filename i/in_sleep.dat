5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds <b>in</b> <b>sleep,</b> it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> quality.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder {{wrote about}} the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii. He {{documented}} Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve vision ailments, aid <b>in</b> <b>sleep,</b> and heal everything from mouth sores and toothaches, to dog bites, lumbago and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after it was buried in a volcanic explosion found gardens of Pliny's detailed narratives, where onions had grown.|$|E

5|$|The affective {{subscale}} contains eight items: pessimism, past failures, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal {{thoughts or}} wishes, and worthlessness. The somatic subscale {{consists of the}} other thirteen items: sadness, loss of pleasure, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, loss of energy, change <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> patterns, irritability, change in appetite, concentration difficulties, tiredness and/or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0.57, suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct.|$|E
5|$|Characters can {{continue}} to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer {{is limited to a}} few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E

5|$|In , Sora and Riku {{undertake}} a Mark of Mastery exam {{in response to}} Xehanort's return. The two are sent to awaken several worlds submerged <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> after the defeat of Ansem, but once the task is complete, Sora's heart is damaged by Xemnas, whose companions plan to turn him into a vessel for Xehanort's heart. Riku and his friends save Sora and {{bring him back to}} Yen Sid's tower, where Riku dives into Sora's body and repairs his heart, awakening him from his coma. As Yen Sid promotes Riku as a Keyblade Master, Sora congratulates him and continues to train elsewhere. In the ending of Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage for Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, Yen Sid reveals Sora lost most of his powers when Xehanort tried to take over his body. After advising Sora to seek out one who already went through a similar experience, Sora, Donald, and Goofy go to Olympus Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E

25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} sleep mode {{in which the}} processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption {{is one of the}} advantages of sleep mode over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode results in data loss, while cutting the power of a system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the power is restored. Both shut down and hibernated systems may consume standby power unless they are unplugged.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} a new Hybrid Sleep power-saving mode that combines hibernation and sleep mode functionality. When active, Hybrid Sleep saves {{information from a}} computer's memory to a hibernation file on disk, but instead of turning off the computer, it initiates sleep mode. Traditionally, systems that lose power while <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode will also lose all data resident in memory. However, since systems that resume from Hybrid Sleep do so by retrieving information from a hibernation file on disk, they offer the benefits of quickly resuming when <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> mode and improved reliability {{in the event of}} power loss.|$|E
