5|$|The Polo Historical Society {{erected a}} {{memorial}} to Durley on May 19, 1910, the 78th anniversary of the attack. At that time, Durley's remains were moved from where St. Vrain's party buried him, near where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen,</b> and interred beneath the memorial. The Buffalo Grove ambush historical marker and memorial to Durley are located west {{of the city of}} Polo, Illinois along Eagle Point Road.|$|E

5|$|Later, in the Central Asian campaign, {{a second}} plot against {{his life was}} revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> out of favour by leading {{the opposition to the}} attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E
5|$|Akash {{attends the}} bank {{settlement}} and reconciles with several friends with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> out, {{as well as}} with his estranged father. Meanwhile, Kiara cannot stop thinking about Akash, and on the 31st she realises that she has fallen for him. Kunal discovers this and drops Kiara off at the airport. She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash again. Just then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer bottle with a note in it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her. Surprised, she accepts, and the couple share a kiss while the Coast Guard rescues them. As the credits roll, Akash and Kiara are shown two years later, married with their baby boy.|$|E
5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> in love with Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E

5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> in love with.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on December 19, {{there were}} troop {{movements}} in the capital as the junta deposed the civilians. The operation was commanded by Thi—who had travelled into Saigon from I Corps in the far north—and Kỳ. The national police, which was {{under the control of}} the army, moved through the streets, arresting five HNC members, other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to their aims. Minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to Pleiku, a Central Highlands town in a Montagnard area, while other officers were simply imprisoned in Saigon. The junta's forces also arrested around 100 members of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of Le Khac Quyen; the NSC was a new party active in central Vietnam in the I Corps region and opposed to the expansion of the war. It was aligned with Thi and the Buddhist activist monk Thích Trí Quang, but as Thi was active in the purge, it was believed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> out with Quyen.|$|E
5|$|Following his retirement, Killebrew was a {{television}} broadcaster for the Twins at WTCN TV from 1976 to 1978, the Oakland Athletics from 1979 to 1982, the California Angels in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988. While with Oakland, {{he also served}} as a major- and minor-league hitting instructor. In the late 1980s, Killebrew had financial problems. In July 1988, his house went into foreclosure and, in 1989, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> $700,000 into debt. He also divorced his first wife of over 30 years, Elaine, who he had married in 1955. Soon after, Killebrew's health failed. In May 1990, he {{was rushed to the hospital}} with a collapsed lung and damaged esophagus. Together with a subsequent abscess and staph infection, Killebrew endured three surgeries and nearly died. He used a wheelchair for some time post-surgery. By December 1990, his health was improved and he was remarried to Nita.|$|E

5|$|Halliday's loan was {{extended}} {{for the rest}} of the season ahead of his return from a three-match suspension, having establish himself at right back ahead of McCoy before his sending off against Accrington. Having made only five appearances for York Mooney was loaned to Conference Premier club Alfreton Town {{for the rest of}} the season. York entered their home match against Stevenage with the visitors on a five-match unbeaten run, and lost 2–0 with the away team scoring in each half. Striker Emile Sinclair was signed on a one-and-a-half-year contract after having his contract at Northampton cancelled, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> down the pecking order. Walsall's Malvind Benning was signed on a one-month loan to provide competition for Ilesanmi at left back. Sinclair scored in the 70th minute of his debut against Burton with a close range finish, before the away team equalised late in the match through Adam McGurk. Straker joined Scottish Premiership club Motherwell on loan {{for the rest of the}} season having played infrequently under Wilcox. York created a number of chances away to Southend before losing 1–0, Shaq Coulthirst scoring an 88th-minute penalty.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Crowley {{travelled}} to Mexico via the United States, {{settling in}} Mexico City {{and taking a}} local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later {{claimed to have been}} initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested {{that the purpose of the}} trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery (1903).|$|E
5|$|Henry of Huntingdon, {{the medieval}} chronicler, {{wrote a letter}} {{entitled}} De contemptu mundi where he related a story from right before Bloet's death that Bloet felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> from King Henry's favour. Bloet allegedly told Huntingdon that the bishop had lost two lawsuits. However, the whole letter is concerned with setting out examples of prominent men who suffered a fall from grace, so possible bias on Huntingdon's part must be kept in mind. There are also records of two legal proceedings involving Bloet {{at the end of}} Bloet's life, and although Bloet lost both cases, neither was a loss of much income or prestige. In one, he was allowed to continue to hold the property, although instead of it being judged as his land alone, the settlement was that Bloet held it of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. The other lawsuit involved Bloet's attempt to hold a manor free of dues owed to Westminster Abbey, which was settled in the Abbey's favour, although Bloet continued to hold the land. Nor is there any lessening of the rate of Bloet's witnessing to royal documents. It appears that Bloet's lost lawsuits were decided by other royal justices, and while he may have lost some favour with the king, he did not fall completely out of favour either.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada's {{legislative}} assembly approved confederation by 91 votes to 33. None of the Maritimes, however, had approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald {{and his colleagues}} financed pro-confederation candidates in the New Brunswick general election, resulting in a pro-confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, Nova Scotia's premier, Charles Tupper, pushed a pro-confederation resolution through that colony's legislature. A final conference, {{to be held in}} London, was needed before the British parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers. In December 1866, Macdonald both led the London Conference, winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and wooed and won his second wife, Agnes Bernard. Bernard was the sister of Macdonald's private secretary, Hewitt Bernard; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856. In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire to the chair <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> asleep in, but Macdonald refused to miss any sessions of the conference. In February, he married Agnes at St George's, Hanover Square. On 8 March, the British North America Act, which would thereafter serve as the major part of Canada's constitution, passed the House of Commons (it had previously passed the House of Lords). Queen Victoria gave the bill Royal Assent on 29 March 1867.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> in love with Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to {{play a significant role in}} the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the back room of The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E
