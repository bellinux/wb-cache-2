40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} current or future shortages of qualified U. S. elementary and secondary teachers. Data come from the 1987 - 1988 and 1990 - 1991 waves of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), a nationally representative study by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The SASS includes four sets of integrated questionnaires for schools, central districts, principals, and teachers. This analysis includes selected historical and other data from several other large scale surveys; class size data from the National Education Association's Status of the American Public School Teacher Survey; salary and supply data from the NCES ' Recent College Graduates Survey; and data on student enrollment, teachers employed, and pupil-teacher ratios from NCES ' Common Core of Data Survey. Results indicate {{that large numbers of}} principals have trouble finding qualified candidates to fill positions. For both public and private schools, the most common methods of handling difficulties in <b>filling</b> <b>opening...</b>|$|E

40|$|The quantum {{states in}} metal {{clusters}} bunch into supershells with associated orbitals having shapes resembling those in atoms, {{giving rise to}} the concept that selected clusters could mimic the characteristics of atoms and be classified as superatoms. Unlike atoms, the superatom orbitals span over multiple atoms and the filling of orbitals does not usually exhibit Hund’s rule seen in atoms. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing exchange splitting in superatom shells via a composite cluster of a central transition metal and surrounding nearly free electron metal atoms. The transition metal d states hybridize with superatom D states and result in enhanced splitting between the majority and minority sets where the moment and the splitting can be controlled {{by the nature of}} the central atom. We demonstrate these findings through studies on TMMgn clusters where TM is a 3 d atom. The clusters exhibit Hund’s <b>filling,</b> <b>opening</b> the pathway to superatoms with magnetic shells...|$|E

Regulations 1, 2 (2), 7 and 8 of these Regulations make appropriate safety provisions for such vehicles, and Regulation 6 (1) is consequential. Regulation 2 (1) makes more detailed provision for preventing the accumulation of a static charge of electricity during filling or emptying. Under the amendments effected by Regulation 3 the maximum permitted capacity of a tank wagon is increased and more detailed provision is made as to the approval of tbe design of articulated vehicles of a capacity exceeding 1, 500 gallons, and under Regulation 5 the maximum permitted capacity of the compartments into which larger tank wagons must be divided is increased.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is about}} a method for <b>filling</b> an <b>opening</b> in an insulating layer in a fast and highly reliable way {{and can be used}} to <b>fill</b> <b>openings</b> such as trenches and via holes simultaneously. This method is based on the principle of reaction enhanced wetting and simultaneous seed layer formation. The idea is, in contrast to trying to avoid the TiAl 3 formation, to use this reaction to its advantage for the creation of an ultra-thin continuous Al-containing seed layer. The latter allows a bottom to top fill during the subsequent Al-containing metal deposition. As a consequence, the filling process proceeds much faster and is production worthy...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] If {{there is}} a lack of {{qualified}} workers to <b>fill</b> <b>openings,</b> the problem lies in the pipeline. Although it is possible to retrain employees and potential candidates to have the necessary skills that a business requires, this can often be costly and cumbersome. To reliably find workers who are qualified for any job, companies will need to start earlier in the education system. And by early, I mean preschool. America is one of the few advanced industrialized countries in the world that does not have subsidized, government funded, or widely available child care for working parents. This creates a strain on families who often struggle to care for a child when both parents are working...|$|R
