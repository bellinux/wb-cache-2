The measured Young's modulus (≈ 1. 8 GPa) is comparable with that of hard plastic. We also observe fatigue and breakage of capsids after probing them repetitively.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{effect of}} {{unsteady}} thermocapillary convection on the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of a solute between two immiscible liquids within a rectangular microscale channel with differentially heated sidewalls was numerically investigated. A {{computational fluid dynamic}} code in Fortran 77 was developed using the finite volume method with Marker and Cell (MAC) technique to solve the governing equations. The discrete surface tracking technique was used to capture {{the location of the}} moving liquid-liquid interface. The code produced results consistent with those reported in published literature. The effect of the temperature gradients, the aspect ratio, the viscosity of liquid, and the deformation of the interface on the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of a solute were studied. The mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> increases with increasing temperature gradient. The improvement of the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> by the thermocapillary convection was found to be a function of the Peclet number (Pe). At small Pe, the improvement of the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> increases with increasing Pe. At high Pe, increasing the Pe has no significant effect on increasing the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> Increasing the aspect ratio of the cavity up to 1 increases the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> When the aspect ratio is higher than 1, the vortex moves only near the interface, resulting in decreasing the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> By increasing the viscosity of the liquid in top phase, the maximum tangential velocity at the interface decreases. As a result, the improvement of the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> decreases. The deformation of the interface has no significant effect on the improvement of the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> By placing the heating source at the middle of the cavity, two steady vortices can be induced in a cavity. As a result, the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> is slightly enhanced than that in the system with one vortex. By reversing the direction of the temperature gradient, the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> decreases due to the decrease in the velocity of bulk fluid. The thermocapillary convection also promotes the overall reaction process when the top wall of the cavity is served as a catalyst...|$|R
