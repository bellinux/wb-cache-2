This versatility <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> played a part in the continued cultural relevance that this character has enjoyed across the centuries and continues to hold in contemporary culture as well.|$|E

25|$|Among early 20th-century English {{artists who}} have more {{specially}} {{paid attention to the}} devising of bookplates, may be mentioned C. W. Sherborn, G. W. Eve, Robert Anning Bell, J. D. Batten, Erat Harrison, J. Forbes Nixon, Charles Ricketts, John Vinycomb, John Leighton and Warrington Hogg and Frank C. Papé. The development in various directions of process work, by facilitating and cheapening the reproduction of beautiful and elaborate designs, <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> helped much to popularize the bookplate—a thing which in older days was almost invariably restricted to ancestral libraries or to collections otherwise important. Thus the great majority of plates of the period 1880–1920 plates were reproduced by process. Some artists continued to work with the graver. Some of the work they produce challenges comparison with the finest productions of bygone engravers. Of these the best-known are C. W. Sherborn (see Plate) and G. W. Eve in England, and in America J. W. Spenceley of Boston, Mass., K. W. F. Hopson of New Haven, Conn., and E. D. French of New York City.|$|E
25|$|Poirot tells Lord Charles of Lady Julia's offer {{but that}} she is mistaken, as {{she does not know}} that her son was busy with Leonie at the time in question. Poirot {{explains}} that Mrs. Macatta was heard snoring in her room, Mrs. Vanderlyn was heard to call for Leonie from upstairs, and Sir George was with Lord Charles on the terrace. Everyone is accounted except for Carlile and Lord Charles. As Carlile has access to the safe at all times and could have taken tracings at his leisure, only Lord Charles is left. Poirot has no doubts that Lord Charles put the plans in his own pocket. His motive is linked back to a denial given some years earlier that he was involved in negotiations with a belligerent foreign power. As he was indeed involved in such activities he must now have been blackmailed to hand over the plans via Mrs. Vanderlyn. Poirot <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the plans she holds are subtly altered so as to make the design unworkable. Lord Charles confesses to the deception but insists that his motive, refusing to be derailed from leading Britain through the coming world crisis, is pure.|$|E

500|$|The {{rationale}} behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain. [...] Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that [...] "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda {{out of touch}} with the subtleties of the book world." [...] Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: [...] "For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its Harry Potter offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> been entrenched in a few more minds." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press {{believes}} Ellis' {{version of}} events that day, {{although he did not}} witness the game in person. Smizik was the reporter who first broke the story in 1984. Bill Christine, also of the Pittsburgh Press, does not believe Ellis' claim and was at the game that day. Christine was a beat reporter who [...] "practically lived with the team that year". Christine said that he did not notice anything unusual, and says that if Ellis had reported to the stadium only 90 minutes before his scheduled start, reporters would have been told. John Mehno, a reporter who had [...] "extensive interactions" [...] with Ellis over his career, was skeptical about many stories told by Ellis, including the LSD no-hitter. Mehno said that he has not found a teammate who would corroborate the story. However, one of his close friends, Scipio Spinks, a pitcher for the Astros, has said he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> Ellis was telling the truth about his LSD use as he was very familiar with Dock's drug habits, including the use of LSD.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{is known}} that the charity had been in {{operation}} as early as 1656, an anonymous article in The Gentleman's Magazine in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids. This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age. The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the [...] "Maids of Biddenden". The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and {{goes on to say that}} despite the antiquity of the events described, he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> as to their authenticity. As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a broadside published in 1790. The Antiquarian Repertory of 1775 says that the sisters had lived [...] "as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago". Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.|$|E

500|$|In autumn 499 BC, Aristagoras held {{a meeting}} with the members of his faction in Miletus. He {{declared}} that in his opinion the Milesians should revolt, to which all but the historian Hecataeus agreed. At the same time, a messenger sent by Histiaeus arrived in Miletus, imploring Aristagoras to rebel against Darius. Herodotus suggests that this was because Histiaeus was desperate to return to Ionia, and thought he would be sent to Ionia if there was a rebellion. Aristagoras therefore openly declared his revolt against Darius, abdicated from his role as tyrant, and declared Miletus to be a democracy. Herodotus <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that this was only a pretence on Aristagoras's part [...] of giving up power. Rather it was designed to make the Milesians enthusiastically join the rebellion. The army that had been sent to Naxos was still assembled at Myus and included contingents from other Greek cities of Asia Minor (i.e. Aeolia and Doris) as well as men from Mytilene, Mylasa, Termera and Cyme. Aristagoras sent men to capture all the Greek tyrants present in the army and handed them over to their respective cities in order to gain the cooperation of those cities. Some of the tyrants were executed by their cities, but most were simply banished. It has also been suggested (Herodotus does not explicitly say so) that Aristagoras incited the whole army to join his revolt, and also took possession of the ships that the Persians had supplied. If the latter is true, it may explain the length of time it took for the Persians to launch a naval assault on Ionia, since they would have needed to build a new fleet.|$|E
500|$|Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, {{that the}} Duke {{had been thrown}} out of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early 1830, a number of {{newspapers}} printed articles hinting that Ernest {{was having an affair}} with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide—or guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been [...] "accused of every crime in the decalogue". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intent to return to Britain that [...] "a campaign of unparalleled viciousness" [...] began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest's unpopularity, [...] "there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, or a friend with his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them." [...] According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.|$|E

2500|$|The spark that {{ignited a}} flurry of {{prospecting}} and mining activity along the Clearwater River was probably provided by H.R.

Professor of administrative law at the University of Aarhus Jens Peter Christensen, who is now a member of the Danish Supreme Court has described this as [...] "a mess" [...] and as an [...] "overly clever" [...] way for then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to signal that the government [...] will oppose any other changes to the constitution. At the same time Christensen emphasizes, that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> that the procedure is legal.|$|E

It <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind." [...] Adding, “Sometimes all I see is darkness; it's overpowering. So this record is about venting out a lot of that stuff, the gloom, but it also represents some kind of quiet acceptance. Like this is how the situation is, and you're just gonna have to live with it. Use it for what it's worth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{book and}} theory were {{reviewed}} with much skepticism {{by the foreign}} scholars to whom they were addressed. L'Année Psychologique journal, which noted that Sanielevici was reviving the ideas of Napoleonic era naturalist Georges Cuvier, concluded with irony: [...] "One evidently needs a rich imagination such as [...] to pierce through the mysteries of paleontological life for animals and humans that have vanished for so long. The author, who has full confidence in his intuition to guide him, <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> as to the certitude of his convictions." [...] Jean Piveteau, the vertebrate paleontologist, wrote: [...] "To me, {{it does not seem}} worth discussing this new biological theory at length. For sure [...] the reader will identify in it quite a few Lamarckian reminiscences; but [...] will be precisely the most annoying passages from Lamarck". Biologist Georges Bohn also asked rhetorically: [...] " [...] excessive imagination, might it not also be the result of spiritual intoxication from the plants and the soil?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pliny {{gives an}} account of how the trials are {{conducted}} and the various verdicts (sections 4-6). He says he first asks if the accused is a Christian: if they confess that they are, he interrogates them twice more, {{for a total of}} three times, threatening them with death if they continue to confirm their beliefs. If they do not recant, then he orders them to be executed, or, if they are Roman citizens, orders them to be taken to Rome. Despite his uncertainty about the offences connected with being Christian, Pliny says that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that, whatever the nature of their creed, at least their inflexible obstinacy (obstinatio) and stubbornness, (pertinacia) deserve punishment. This shows that, to the Roman authorities, Christians were being hostile to the government and were openly defying a magistrate who was asking them to abandon an unwanted cult. [...] Most notably, the Christians present at these trials Pliny is inquiring about were accused by a privately published anonymous document and not by Pliny nor the empire.|$|E
