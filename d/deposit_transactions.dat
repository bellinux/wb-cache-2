50|$|Mobile banking is {{a service}} {{provided}} by a bank or other financial institution that allows its customers to conduct financial transactions remotely using a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. Unlike the related internet banking it uses software, usually called an app, provided by the financial institution for the purpose. Mobile banking is usually available on a 24-hour basis. Some financial institutions have restrictions on which accounts may be accessed through mobile banking, {{as well as a}} limit on the amount that can be transacted. Transactions through mobile banking may include obtaining account balances and lists of latest transactions, electronic bill payments, and funds transfers between a customer's or another's accounts. Some apps also enable copies of statements to be downloaded and sometimes printed at the customer's premises; and some banks charge a fee for mailing hardcopies of bank statements. From the bank's point of view, mobile banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing the need for customers to visit a bank branch for non-cash withdrawal and <b>deposit</b> <b>transactions.</b> Mobile banking does not handle transactions involving cash, and a customer needs to visit an ATM or bank branch for cash withdrawals or deposits. Many apps now have a remote deposit option; using the device's camera to digitally transmit cheques to their financial institution. Mobile banking differs from mobile payments, which involves the use of a mobile device to pay for goods or services either at the point of sale or remotely, analogously to the use of a debit or credit card to effect an EFTPOS payment.|$|E

40|$|This note {{considers}} {{the application of}} electronic cash to transactions in which many small amounts must {{be paid to the}} same payee and in which {{it is not possible to}} just pay the total amount afterwards. The most notable example of such a transaction is payment for phone calls. If currently published electronic cash systems are used and a full payment protocol is executed for each of the small amounts, the overall complexity of the system will be prohibitively large (time, storage and communication). This note describes how such payments can be handled in a wide class of payment systems. The solution is very easy to adapt as it only in uences the payment and <b>deposit</b> <b>transactions</b> involving such payments. Furthermore, making and verifying each small payment requires very little computation and communication, and the total complexity of both transactions is comparable to that of a payment of a xed amount. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the onset}} of the {{financial}} turmoil in August 2007, pricing references on the money market interest rates have been shocked. The segment of unsecured <b>deposit</b> <b>transactions,</b> which represent the cornerstone of capital markets, and is used as basis for the setting of money market benchmark essential to the indexing of trillions of derivative contracts and loans, has been particularly damaged by the surge in counterparty risk. The lack of confidence between traders and the growing fear of counterparty’s bankruptcies have led progressively to a drying out of the unsecured market turnover. After a relative improvement in early 2008, market activity in the unsecured market has again dried up with the reinforcement of the financial crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Although there are good reasons to think that the market activity in the cash unsecured segment of the money market has remained distorted, in particular for maturities beyond the very short-term, the OIS-LIBOR spreads have been declining extremely steadily since January 2009, both in major currencies and at various maturities, seemingly pointing to a normalization of the money market. On the basis of a simple econometric supported by statistical evidence applied to the euro area date, this paper analyses whether recent developments in the unsecured interest rates actually support a diagnosis of renewed market activity, and of normalization of the unsecured market.

40|$|Liquidity risk {{in banking}} has been {{attributed}} to <b>transactions</b> <b>deposits</b> and their potential to spark runs or panics.

40|$|Viewed from a {{practical}} definition of money, the banking system appears {{to be engaged in}} a significant monetary inflation. The use of reserve-sweep programs, which started in 1994, has allowed banks to reduce the effective reserve requirement on <b>transaction</b> <b>deposits</b> (demand and other checking deposits), freeing up high-powered money for other purposes. This activity has effectively lowered the reserve ratio of banks. While this is old news, this paper examines the monetary evidence over the past decade of sweeps programs and finds there is ample reason for concern that monetary inflation is accelerating because of these programs. The sweeps programs produce distortions in reported monetary components that tend to hide this fact. The symptoms have been a low growth rate of <b>transaction</b> <b>deposits</b> and M 1 from 1995 through 2001 coupled with an abnormally large increase in reported savings deposits since 1995. The growth rate of reported savings deposits has accelerated further since early 2001. Two correction methodologies are used to estimate the true level of savings accounts, <b>transaction</b> <b>deposits,</b> and M 1. One method uses sweeps estimates from the Federal Reserve, and the other uses an extrapolation of the growth rate of savings accounts from a period before the initiation of sweeps programs. Both methods show a large increase in <b>transaction</b> <b>deposit</b> money. The author concludes that a significant monetary inflation is taking place and is laying the foundation for price inflation in the years ahead...|$|R

The first is the Barnet/Donovan user cost approach which is based on the difference between the effective rate and a reference rate representing the pure cost of the funds borrowed without allowance for risk. The other is the effective interest rate. As a whole, we find that transaction products do not change importantly the productivity growth. The main reason is that these products represent quite a small share in the aggregate output (between 6, 8 % and 21, 4 %).

40|$|Credit life insurance, which repays {{some or all}} of a borrower's {{outstanding}} debt in the event of death, has been a controversial subject for many years. Critics assert that, despite regulations that limit tied sales, pressure on loan officers to generate fee income through cross selling creates an incentive for coercion of borrowers. Allegedly, some sales techniques leave the consumer with the false impression that the purchase of credit insurance was necessary to obtain the loan. This article measures the frequency with which creditor efforts to sell credit insurance transform the sales message from persuasive to coercive. A methodology is developed for measuring the impact of coercive selling pressure applied to borrowers at the point of sale. Data used to measure the effect of coercive pressure are taken from an extensive survey of borrowers conducted during 1993. Not only are public policy concerns about coercion in the selling of credit insurance addressed, but more generally the article offers a methodology to quantify the influence of the customer's point-of-sale experience on the decision to purchase any financial service. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
