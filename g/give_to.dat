5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or {{psychiatric}} hospitals received regular wages, which {{they were required to}} <b>give</b> <b>to</b> the federal government. Objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war. A compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until {{after the end of the}} war. At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men's dependents.|$|E

5|$|Numismatic author Dean Albanese {{considers}} the legend that Washington provided the gold {{for the first}} 400 eagles to be improbable; holding $4,000 in coin would have tied up much of Washington's capital in unproductive cash. Albanese suggests that as many surviving 1795 eagles are found with little wear, Washington may have had the government purchase pieces to <b>give</b> <b>to</b> dignitaries. By some reports, one eagle was presented to Washington, though whether it was from this first coinage is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|A family {{goes to a}} {{hotel with}} their gran, (which would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family {{so much that she}} wants them to {{disappear}} as they then do.

But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891.

People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could <b>give</b> <b>to</b> those people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall to <b>give</b> <b>to</b> the group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain {{with one of the}} group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|At Whitsun in 1189, Coutances was {{a member}} of a {{commission}} appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to <b>give</b> <b>to</b> his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister Alice, that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing to <b>give</b> <b>to</b> the runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes.
