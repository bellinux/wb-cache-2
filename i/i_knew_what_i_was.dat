500|$|The first issues Lowndes was {{responsible}} for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had over Hornig, vetoing {{five of the seven}} stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, and [...] didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
500|$|Newman was, {{according}} to Nilsson, [...] "tired {{of the album}} when we were finished making it." [...] "For him it was just doing piano and voice... over and over." [...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take down, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to do with}} it later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he was such a great singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E
500|$|Eddie Van Halen, lead guitarist of {{hard rock}} band Van Halen, {{was asked to}} add a guitar solo. When {{initially}} contacted by Jones, Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call. Having established that the call was genuine, Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge. [...] "I did it as a favor", the musician later said. [...] "I was a complete fool, according {{to the rest of}} the band, our manager and everyone else. I was not used. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing – I don't do something unless I want to do it." [...] Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist's house with a [...] "skeleton version" [...] of the song. Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled, [...] "Initially, we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo—but Quincy thought it was too tough. So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released." [...] The song was among the last four completed for Thriller; the others were [...] "Human Nature", [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" [...] and [...] "The Lady in My Life".|$|E

500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here to do", Strickland said.|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] When {{he had worked}} for Gernsback, Silberkleit had suggested [...] "Future Fiction" [...] as a possible title for the magazine Gernsback was planning to launch. [...] Gernsback eventually chose [...] "Amazing Stories" [...] instead, and Silberkleit now decided to use his original suggestion {{for one of the}} new magazines. [...] In November 1939 the first issue of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig received his military draft notice; he was a pacifist, and decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector. [...] He continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards [...] "I would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim heard of the offer and prompted Robert W. Lowndes to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that {{it might be a good}} idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. [...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E

Christopher would pay tribute to his father's contribution to the war: [...] "Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done." [...] He also stated that [...] "the remark that most summed him [...] up was the flat statement that the war of 1939 to 1945 had been 'the only time when I really felt <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing'." ...|$|E

Four of these were issued as singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October), [...] "Heaven on a Stick" [...] (February 1988), [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June) and [...] "Always the Way" [...] (November). James later told Debbie Kruger that [...] " [...] was not {{necessarily}} about me, but let's say I thought <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking about.

2500|$|Born near Alexanderplatz in Berlin to {{a middle-class}} Jewish family, {{he began his}} musical {{education}} at the Stern Conservatory {{at the age of}} eight, making his first public appearance as a pianist when he was nine; he performed a concerto movement with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1889 and a full concerto with them in February, 1890. He studied composition at Stern with Robert Radecke, and remained active as a composer until about 1910 (see list of compositions below). But it was hearing a concert in 1889 by the Berlin Philharmonic led by Hans von Bülow, he wrote, that [...] "decided my future. Now <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> meant for. No musical activity but that of an orchestral conductor could any longer be considered by me." [...] He made his conducting début at the Cologne Opera with Albert Lortzing's Der Waffenschmied in 1894. Later that year he left for the Hamburg Opera to work as a chorus director. There he first met and worked with Gustav Mahler, whom he revered and with whose music he later became strongly identified.|$|E

I had no chance to move. I looked and the ball was in my glove. I made like <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing." [...] In 1990, Al Newman {{was a part of}} setting a major league record as the Minnesota Twins turned 2 triple plays in one game against the Boston Red Sox, making the final throw in both. Also during the 1990 season, teammate and future Hall of Famer, Kirby Puckett, was moved around the field from his normal centerfield position to play right field, third base, shortstop, and second base in a single game. Newman jokingly remarked to the press following the game, [...] "I'm glad Puck's one of us utility guys now. Maybe he'll raise the salary structure a little." ...|$|E
