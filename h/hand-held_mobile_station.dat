50|$|Any {{use of a}} <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> {{phone or}} similar device while driving, or supervising a learner driver, is illegal. This {{includes}} when stopped at traffic lights. The only exceptions are emergency calls to 999 or 112.|$|R
50|$|Laws {{have not}} led to {{consistent}} driver compliance. <b>Hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phone usage fell in New York {{in the five}} months after the hands-free law took effect. However, it returned to near the prior level by the 16-month mark.|$|R
50|$|Librestream {{is notable}} in that its technology, {{consisting}} of unique <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> devices and accompanying software, extends traditional video conferencing and collaborative services to places previously unreachable {{such as an}} off-shore oil rig or a manufacturing plant floor a continent away.|$|R
50|$|Videoconferencing on <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> devices (mobile {{collaboration}} technology) {{is being}} used in industries such as manufacturing, energy, healthcare, insurance, government and public safety. Live, visual interaction removes traditional restrictions of distance and time, often in locations previously unreachable, such as a manufacturing plant floor a continent away.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{collaboration}} systems {{combine the}} use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> devices to enable multi-party conferencing in real-time, independent of location.

40|$|Using a <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phone whilst driving {{has been}} linked to an {{increased}} risk of being involved in a road crash. Little research, however, has been done on actual road exposure rates to this potential safety problem. The main aim of this study was therefore to establish the number of drivers who use <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phones while driving, and to discover if this number had increased as compared to similar observations obtained one year earlier. 40 roadside observations were made at major roads during daylight hours. On average approximately 1. 5 % of all vehicle drivers were observed using <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phones. No significant difference was found between the percentage of drivers observed to be using phones in an earlier study and this current study. In addition, separate observations were undertaken at four sites at four periods of the 'normal' working day to establish if a possible time of day effect existed. The data found that the level of mobile phone use did not significantly differ during the day, however, as a percentage of vehicle flow, the highest use period was between 11. 00 and 12. 00. Finally, for the same four sites, supplementary measures were taken to establish personal characteristics of the phone users. It was found that phone users were predominantly male (78 %) and less than 40 -years old (64 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Information systems {{consist of}} {{multiple}} <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> and fixed stations communicating with each other. Mission critical applications {{are required to}} be executed fault-tolerantly in these systems. However, <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> support neither enough volume of storage and processing power nor enough capacity of battery to do reliable communication for a long period. Moreover, wireless communication channels are less reliable. Hence, the communication channels with the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are often disconnected. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> to take checkpoints synchronously since the communication channels with the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> may be disconnected even during taking the checkpoints. We have proposed hybrid checkpointing where checkpoints are taken asynchronously by the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> and synchronously by the fixed stations.

5000|$|Internal Roaming: The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> (MS) {{moves from}} one access point (AP) to another AP within a home network if the signal {{strength}} is too weak. An authentication server (RADIUS) performs the re-authentication of MS via 802.1x (e.g. with PEAP). The billing of QoS {{is in the}} home network. A <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> roaming from one access point to another often interrupts the flow of data among the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> and an application connected to the network. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station,</b> for instance, periodically monitors the presence of alternative access points (ones that will provide a better connection). At some point, based on proprietary mechanisms, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> decides to re-associate with an access point having a stronger wireless signal. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station,</b> however, may lose a connection with an access point before associating with another access point. In order to provide reliable connections with applications, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> must generally include software that provides session persistence.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} data {{confidentiality}} for wireless broadband (WiBro) networks. In WiBro, as the channel is wireless in nature, it suffers from passive and active attack. Passive attack, for example is to decrypt traffic based on statistical analysis and active attack is to modify traffic or inject new traffic from unauthorized <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> Due to high mobility, frequent session key distribution is a bottleneck for the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> In aspect of WiBro, {{there is a}} communication between <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> to base station, and also in <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> to <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> It is expected to ensure data confidentiality while maintaining minimum overhead for the resource constrained <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> In this paper, we proposed a security framework based {{on the concept of}} hyper-encryption to provide data confidentiality for wireless broadband networks. 1...|$|R

50|$|The first {{telephones}} {{were directly}} connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards. This gave rise to landline telephone service in which each telephone is connected {{by a pair of}} dedicated wires to a local central office switching system, which developed into fully automated systems starting in the early 1900s. For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> on ships and automobiles in the middle 20th century. <b>Hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. By the late 1970s several mobile telephone networks operated around the world. In 1983, the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was launched, offering a standardized technology providing portability for users far beyond the personal residence or office. These analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with better security, greater capacity, better regional coverage, and lower cost. The public switched telephone network, with its hierarchical system of many switching centers, interconnects telephones around the world for communication with each other. With the standardized international numbering system, E.164, each telephone line has an identifying telephone number, that may be called from any authorized telephone on the network.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phone use {{while driving}} is illegal {{throughout}} Australia yet many drivers persist with this behaviour. This study aims {{to understand the}} internal, driver-related and external, situational-related factors influencing drivers’ willingness to use a <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phone while driving. Sampling 160 university students, this study utilised the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to examine a range of belief-based constructs. Additionally, drivers’ personality traits of neuroticism and extroversion were measured with the Neuroticism Extroversion Openness-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). In relation to the external, situational-related factors, four different driving-related scenarios, which were intended to evoke differing levels of drivers’ reported stress, were devised for the study and manipulated drivers’ time urgency (low versus high) and passenger presence (alone versus with friends). In these scenarios, drivers’ willingness to use a mobile phone in general was measured. Hierarchical regression analyses across the four different driving scenarios found that, overall, the TPB components significantly accounted for drivers’ willingness to use a mobile phone {{above and beyond the}} demographic variables. Subjective norms, however, was only a significant predictor of drivers’ willingness in situations where the drivers were driving alone. Generally, neuroticism and extroversion did not significantly predict drivers’ willingness above and beyond the TPB and demographic variables. Overall, the findings broaden our understanding of the internal and external factors influencing drivers’ willingness to use a <b>hand-held</b> <b>mobile</b> phone while driving despite the illegality of this behaviour. The findings may have important practical implications in terms of better informing road safety campaigns targeting drivers’ mobile phone use which, in turn, may contribute to a reduction in the extent that mobile phone use contributes to road crashes...|$|R
