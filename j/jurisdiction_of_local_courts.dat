5000|$|Adolphus Ballard {{argued that}} the {{interpretation}} of the word [...] "soke" [...] as jurisdiction should be accepted only where it stands for the fuller phrase, [...] "sake and soke", and that [...] "soke" [...] standing by itself denoted services. Certainly, many passages in the Domesday Book support this contention, but in other passages [...] "soke" [...] seems to serve merely as a short expression for [...] "sake and soke".

50|$|At first, new writs were drafted to fit {{each new}} situation, {{although}} in practice the clerks of the Chancery would use wording from previously issued writs, with suitable adjustments, often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ, {{much as in}} modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate, rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document. The problem with this approach was that a plaintiff's rights and available forms of action at his disposal, would be defined, {{and in most cases}} limited, by the limited variety of writs available to him. Thus the power to create new writs was akin to the power to create new rights, a form of extra-parliamentary legislation. Moreover, a writ, if one could be found fitting the plaintiff's case, provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>local</b> <b>court,</b> often controlled by a lesser noble, and instead have it heard by the King's judges. The nobility thus saw the creation of new writs as an erosion of their influence.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} is different {{with respect to}} jurisdictional principles in the international context. The first difference concerns long-arm jurisdiction, which is the statutory grant <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to <b>local</b> <b>courts</b> over out-of-state defendants. A long-arm statute authorizes a court in a state to exercise jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. Without a long-arm statute, the courts in a state might not have personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. A state's authorization to exercise jurisdiction {{is limited by the}} federal Constitution. The use of a long-arm statute is usually considered constitutional where the defendant has certain minimum contacts with the forum state and there has been reasonable notice of the action against that defendant.|$|R
