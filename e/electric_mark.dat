Approximately 4,000,000 tons of enemy shipping were sunk by the Mark 14 torpedo. Originally introduced for use as mechanically-set torpedo, the Mark 14 was modified for use with modern fire control systems and designated Mod 5.|$|E

5000|$|Their {{principal}} {{weapon was}} the steam-powered Mark 14 torpedo {{in the early}} war years, with the <b>electric</b> <b>Mark</b> 18 torpedo supplementing the Mark 14 in late 1943. Due to a stunted research and development phase in the Depression-era 1930s, and in great {{part due to the}} arrogance and stubbornness of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance, the [...] "wonder weapon" [...] Mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable. They tended to run too deep, explode prematurely, run erratically, or fail to detonate. Bowing to pressure from the submariners in the Pacific, the Bureau eventually acknowledged the problems in the Mark 14 and largely corrected them by late 1943. The Mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured German G7e weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943. Unfortunately it too was full of faults, the most dangerous being a tendency to run in a circular pattern and come back at the sub that fired it. Once perfected, both types of torpedoes proved to be reliable and effective weapons, allowing the Gatos and other submarines to sink an enormous amount of Japanese shipping {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
30|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>marks</b> and joule burn are {{important}} features of electrocution when low- or medium-voltage current is involved. Often, <b>electric</b> <b>marks</b> are not produced {{in cases of}} electrocution. In such cases, histological examination of the skin from the electric wound was done to support the findings of death due to electrocution. It has been observed that histological examination could be an important aspect in diagnosis of electrocution, as observed in 89.7 % of cases that were indicating signs of electrical injuries. Of these changes, all findings suggestive of electrical injuries were found in 67.04 % of cases. Electrical injuries produce high-temperature burns in many cases, leading to production of distinctive findings of severe thermal denaturation of collagen causing it to stain blue with haematoxylin. Separation of the epidermis with formation of microblisters within squamous epithelium {{as well as in}} the horny layer was seen. There is stretching and narrowing of the contour of the nuclei of epidermal cell at the site of an electrical burn resulting in a palisade type of appearance. This change is often referred to as streaming of the nuclei (Spitz 1993).|$|R

Bridenbaugh claimed that the design [...] "did {{not take into account the}} dynamic loads that could be experienced with a loss of coolant" [...] and that, despite efforts to retrofit the reactors, [...] "the Mark 1 is still a little more susceptible to an accident that would result in a loss of containment." ...|$|R

50|$|Experts {{have long}} criticized General <b>Electric's</b> <b>Mark</b> I reactor {{containment}} design, because it offered a relatively weak containment vessel. Three GE scientists resigned 35 {{years ago in}} protest of {{the design of the}} Mark I containment system. David Lochbaum, chief nuclear safety officer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, has repeatedly questioned the safety of the Fukushima I Plant's GE Mark 1 reactor containment design. In a 2012 nuclear power safety report, David Lochbaum and Edwin Lyman said:The designs of the Fukushima reactors closely resemble those of many U.S. reactors, and the respective emergency response procedures are comparable as well. But while most U.S. reactors may not be vulnerable to that site’s specific earthquake/ tsunami sequence, they are vulnerable to other severe natural disasters. Moreover, similarly serious conditions could be created by a terrorist attack.|$|R

Meanwhile, Davis has examined Latham's body and realizes that the <b>electric</b> <b>marks</b> left on Latham {{were the same as}} the criminals. Steiner shows up at Hill's house, where he finds her and Mitchell. Steiner demands that they tell him where he can find more electricity, since after the projection he needs energy to survive. Hill and Mitchell try to convince him to return to the laboratory so they can try reversing the projection, but Steiner rebuffs them and leaves toward a power plant.|$|R
