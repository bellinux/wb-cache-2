Miyamoto decided to name the game for the ape, whom he felt to be the strongest character. The story of how Miyamoto {{came up with the}} name [...] "Donkey Kong" [...] varies. A false urban myth says that the name was originally meant to be [...] "Monkey Kong", but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad telephone connection. Another, more credible story claims Miyamoto looked in a Japanese-English dictionary for something that would mean [...] "stubborn gorilla", or that [...] "Donkey" [...] was meant to convey [...] "silly" [...] or [...] "stubborn"; [...] "Kong" [...] was common Japanese slang for [...] "gorilla". A rival claim is that he worked with Nintendo's <b>export</b> <b>manager</b> {{to come up with the}} title, and that [...] "Donkey" [...] was meant to represent [...] "stupid and goofy". In the end, Miyamoto stated that he thought the name would convey the thought of a [...] "stupid ape".|$|E

40|$|Scenario-based {{survey data}} from <b>export</b> <b>managers</b> in the U. S. and Peru {{are used to}} explore {{interactive}} decision-making in an international distribution channel context. Export managers' first and second order expectations [J. Acad. Market. Sci. 13 (1985) 4] are operationalized in terms of affect- and cognition-based trust mechanisms [Soc. Forces 63 (1985) 967] and are examined in relation to multi-stage interactive decision-making. Findings suggest that building trust early is more dependent on matching, rather than exceeding, a partner's expectations. In addition, managers who heavily weigh their beliefs of what others expect of them in decision-making, tend to make affect-based decisions {{in the early stages}} of an interorganizational relationship. Finally, consistent with culture-based theories on in-group/out-group orientation, Peruvian <b>export</b> <b>managers</b> were more likely than US <b>export</b> <b>managers</b> to focus on a more instrumental, or cognitive, approach to building an initial export-import relationship.

The aim of the current research is to examine the barriers to the export of Greek wine. In-depth Personal interviews were undertaken with producers, managers and people involved in the Greek wine industry. Participants provided information about the current situation and their projections about future. This research is based on qualitative methods. According to the results of the research the barriers could be separated into three basic categories, logistic and financial barriers, marketing and promotion barriers and policy barriers. This research offers Greek wine <b>export</b> <b>managers</b> and people involved in wine industry in general a possible mean of evaluating the marketing potentials of Greek wine in the international marketplace.

40|$|Each year, {{the value}} of gray market {{products}} sold throughout the world runs into the billions of dollars. Past research has stated that exporters of manufactured goods can hardly afford to ignore the possibility of this phenomenon due to the often severe effects on their sales volume, margins, and relationships with distributors and end-users. Through a survey of <b>export</b> <b>managers</b> of manufacturing firms, coupled {{with a series of}} qualitative interviews, this study investigates how organizational specific, control specific, and market specific factors drive gray market activity, and in turn explores the effects of unauthorized distribution on export performance. Several factors are shown to evaluate the potential of unauthorized distribution in their export markets, namely the centralization of decision making, {{the degree to which the}} product is standardized, channel integration, and channel control. International experience, market volatility, and the number of markets served were found to have no effect on gray market activity, this contrary to traditional thinking. Furthermore, the effects of gray market activity on strategic versus economic performance is shown to be significantly different.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore how managers’ export {{experience}} can affect the change in product design following changes in perceived past performance. Using data from 519 Portuguese exporters we find that performance improvement will encourage safe decision making in which firms either will not change the product design or will change {{it in a way}} that makes it more similar across the product range. However, when managers’ export experience is greater they encourage change in ways that could support product differentiation. The abilities of experienced managers to read the market, i. e. to interpret changes in performance and translate them into product specifications, help explain these findings. We contribute to the literature in two ways. First, we explore the relationship between past export performance change, product design, and managers’ export experience. Second, we identify specific kinds of design changes that firms adopt in response to changes in different dimensions of organizational performance. Based on our findings we would recommend to new product development managers to consider both managers’ export experience and the dimension used to measure performance when evaluating calls for standardizing the design by <b>export</b> <b>managers.</b> Our findings suggest that such calls could be driven by short-term gains in export performance. Furthermore, we would also emphasize the need to routinely capture information from experienced <b>export</b> <b>managers</b> to ensure that it is considered in future decisions about design changes...|$|R
