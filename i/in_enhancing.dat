5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium is {{a nonprofit}} public {{aquarium}} in Monterey, California. The aquarium {{is known for its}} regional focus on the habitats of Monterey Bay, being the first institution to exhibit a living kelp forest. Its biologists have pioneered the animal husbandry of jellyfish, and , it remains the only public aquarium to have successfully exhibited a great white shark for more than 16 days. The aquarium's seafood consumer awareness program has had an influential role among consumers and businesses <b>in</b> <b>enhancing</b> sustainable fishing practices.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties <b>in</b> <b>enhancing</b> the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the use of}} the Internet {{resulted}} in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits <b>in</b> <b>enhancing</b> language learning, especially in second or foreign language learning. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, discussion forums, chat messengers, blogs, etc.).|$|E

While diversity breeds potential threats to globalisation, long-term language planning must be sensitive enough to tackle the precarious linguistic situation to protect Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil, perhaps even Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu alongside English.|$|E
30|$|The {{trend of}} growing {{interest}} in alternative source of energy focuses on renewable products worldwide. However, the situation of petroleum industries in many countries needs much concern in improving the oil recovery technique. Chemical method, especially microemulsion flooding, {{plays an important role}} <b>in</b> <b>enhanced</b> oil recovery technique due to its ability to reduce interfacial tension between oil and water to a large extent as well as alter wettability of reservoir rocks. Surfactant-based chemical systems have been reported in many academic studies and their technological implementations are potential candidates <b>in</b> <b>enhanced</b> oil recovery activities. This paper reviews the role of different types of surfactants <b>in</b> <b>enhanced</b> oil recovery, structure of microemulsion, phase behavior of oil–brine–surfactant/cosurfactant systems with variation of different parameters such as salinity, temperature, pressure and physicochemical properties of microemulsions including solubilization capacity, interfacial tension, viscosity and density under reservoir conditions. The enhanced oil productivity by microemulsion flooding with different surfactant/cosurfactant systems has also been discussed in this paper. This review introduces a new opening <b>in</b> <b>enhanced</b> oil recovery by microemulsion flooding with some new aspects.|$|R
