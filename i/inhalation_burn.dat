40|$|Introduction: Anhydrous Ammonia (AA) is a caustic {{compound}} {{commonly used}} in the industry that can cause burns, even with brief contact. As with other alkali burns, the early washing to remove the AA from burnt areas is crucial to limit tissue damage. The concentration of toxic agent and duration of its contact determine the degree of skin and mucosa destruction. A tanker truck carrying AA (NH 3) fell off a highway, and released a dense cloud of AA gas. Fifty-four people inhaled the gas and after ninety days, three people were still experiencing hoarseness and were examined. Case Report: We assessed three patients with laryngeal sequelae due to AA <b>inhalation</b> <b>burn.</b> We found a case of hyperemia and edema, one case of granuloma of the posterior third portion of the left vocal cord, and one case of vocal cord adhesion.

40|$|Purpose: Conventional chest X-ray and {{pulmonary}} {{function test}} cannot sensitively detect inhalation injury. Bronchoscopy {{is known to}} be the gold standard but it is invasive method. We evaluated whether lung inhalation/perfusion scans can sensitively detect inhalation injury of fire victims. Materials and Methods: Nineteen patients (male 9, female 10, mean age 31. 6 yr) of fire victims were enrolled in this study. Inhalation lung scan was performed 2 days later after inhalation injury with 99 mTc-technegas. Perfusion lung scan was performed 4 days later with 99 mTc- MAA (macroaggregated albumin). Follow up lung scans were performed 16 and 18 days later for each. Chest X-ray was performed in all patients and bronchoscopy was performed in 17 of 19 patients at the same period. Pulmonary function test was performed in 9 patients. Results: Four of 19 patients showed inhalation and perfusion defects and one showed inhalation defect but, normal perfusion scan findings. These five patients with abnormal scan findings showed abnormal bronchoscopic findings and severe respiratory symptoms. On chest X-ray, 2 of them had pulmonary tuberculosis and one of them showed pulmonary congestion. FEV 1 /FVC was abnormal in 3 patients. On the follow up scan, all patients with abnormal initial scan findings showed improved findings and they had improved clinical state. Conclusion: Inhalation/perfusion lung scans can detect <b>inhalation</b> <b>burn</b> injury noninvasively in early stage and may be useful in therapeutic decision making and follow up o...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{reduction}} in medical staff such as occurs in hospitals during nights and weekends (off hours) {{is associated with}} a worse outcome in patients with several unanticipated critical conditions. Although difficult airway management (DAM) requires the simultaneous assistance of several appropriately trained medical caregivers, data are scarce regarding the association between off-hour presentation and endotracheal intubation (ETI) -related adverse events, especially in the trauma population. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether off-hour presentation was associated with ETI complications in injured patients with a predicted difficult airway. Methods: This historical cohort study was conducted at a Japanese community emergency department (ED). All patients with <b>inhalation</b> <b>burn,</b> comminuted facial trauma (Abbreviated Injury Scale Score Face ≥ 3), and penetrating neck injury who underwent ETI from January 2007 to January 2016 in our ED were included. Primary exposure was off-hour presentation, defined as the period from 6 : 01 PM to 8 : 00 AM weekdays plus the entire weekend. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an ETI-related adverse event, including hypoxemia, unrecognized esophageal intubation, regurgitation, cardiac arrest, ETI failure rescued by emergency surgical airway, cuff leak, and mainstem bronchus intubation. Results: Of the 123 patients, 75 (61. 0 %) were intubated during off hours. Crude analysis showed that off-hour presentation was significantly associated with an increased risk of ETI-related adverse events [odds ratio (OR), 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 1 – 5. 6; p[*]=[*] 0. 033]. The increased risk remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders, including operator being an anesthesiologist, use of a paralytic agent, and injury severity score (OR, 3. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 1 – 8. 4; p[*]=[*] 0. 034). Conclusions: In this study, off-hour presentation was independently associated with ETI-related adverse events in trauma patients with a predicted difficult airway. These data imply the need for more attentive hospital care during nights and weekends...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{migration}} of alveolar macrophages was studied in 24 fire victims and 19 controls; {{all subjects were}} cigarette smokers. Unstimulated (P = 0. 01) and stimulated migration towards casein-(P = 0. 01) and zymosan-activated serum (P = 0. 002) of macrophages from smoke inhalation patients (SI) (n = 19) was increased when compared to control subjects (CS). Migration of alveolar macrophages from patients with <b>burns</b> without smoke <b>inhalation</b> (<b>burns</b> only, BO) was not increased. Patients with smoke <b>inhalation</b> and no <b>burns</b> (smoke only, SO) (n = 9) had increased migration when compared to controls {{but this was not}} statistically significant.

40|$|In daily {{clinical}} routine {{the combination}} of <b>inhalation</b> and <b>burn</b> trauma is often to be found with fire victims. The mortality of such a combined trauma is {{higher than those of}} the single injuries. The pathophysiologic and immunologic pathways that lead to this increased mortality are not yet fully revealed. Therefore experimental animal models are needed to examine those post traumatic reactions in a living organism. In {{the first part of this}} work we have succeeded in setting up a standardized small animal model to examine <b>inhalation</b> and <b>burn</b> trauma in the rat. This model stands out due to its high standardization of the added traumas as well as its good ability for reproduction. The animal model developed in the course of this work is thereby recommended for further use in future studies. The second part of this work examined the immunologic effects of the combined trauma under special consideration of the intraalveolar interleukin- 6 concentration. Within the control group it was possible to observe a significant increase of the intraalveolar interleukin- 6 concentration after physiological respirator therapy alone. In comparison to the other test groups the control group showed the highest IL- 6 concentrations throughout our observations. The single <b>inhalation</b> and <b>burn</b> trauma produced no statistically significant trend of the measured IL- 6 concentrations during the first 6 hours post trauma. After combined <b>burn</b> and <b>inhalation</b> injury we were also not able to show statistically significant results, nevertheless our data revealed a trend that this combined trauma leads to an increased intraalveolar IL- 6 excretion. Since these results of the second part of our studies do not allow a closer conclusion on the immunologic pathways after combined inhalation and thermal trauma, we suggest further validation of our findings in a similar experimental setting using small animals like the rat. Therefore future studies should incorporate other immunologic mediators and cytokines, because the increased mortality after a combined <b>inhalation</b> and <b>burn</b> trauma is not explainable by monitoring a single factor of this complex chain reaction...|$|R

To date, {{there have been}} limited studies investigating the validity and practicality of both maximal laboratory and field tests in adult burns survivors. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the metabolic and ventilatory response to cardiopulmonary maximal exercise testing (CPET) and the modified shuttle walk test (MSWT) in adult burns patients. Fifteen people (13 male) with a mean TBSA of 38. 5 % (16. 0 %) underwent both MSWT and CPET within a 5 -day period in random order. The majority of participants demonstrated a normal response to CPET. Two participants with a history of <b>inhalation</b> <b>burns</b> demonstrated a respiratory limitation to exercise with desaturation (91 and 89 %) at the end of the CPET, which returned to normal within 2 minutes after exercise. The correlation between VO 2 peak as measured via CPET and distance as measured in MSWT was 0. 7. Mean results measured in MSWT for maximal heart rate and perceived exertion scores were lower than those achieved with CPET results: 91 and 88 %, respectively. There were no adverse events during both the MSWT and CPET. This study demonstrates that after burn injury, CPET and MSWT can be performed safely in the majority of patients early in the postdischarge rehabilitation period. MSWT is likely to be submaximal at 80 to 90 % of CPET results but is easy to replicate and cost-effective, thus a viable mechanism for monitoring aerobic capacity...|$|R

30|$|The overall PDC {{temperature}} {{at the summit}} area was estimated to have been mostly {{in the range of}} 30 – 100  °C, locally exceeding 100  °C. We obtained the following information about the temperature of the PDCs at the summit area and Hatchotarumi. Based on eyewitness accounts (6, 8, 11, 12, and 13 in Fig.  3) from climbers and hut workers, people who were caught in the PDC felt hot air, but the temperature was not high enough to damage the plants in the area. The ignition temperature of leaves and bark of conifers is 430 – 460  °C (e.g., Iwakawa 1985). According to a report by news media, one person died because of <b>inhalation</b> <b>burns</b> and some people suffered light burns. However, people caught in the PDCs and those who suffered burns were a minority. Humans do not experience burns at atmospheric temperatures < 100  °C at a relative humidity of 5 – 10  %, or at temperatures < 50  °C at a relative humidity of 100  % (e.g., Ito 2015). In addition, materials such as raincoats and backpacks made of nylon did not melt in the PDCs. However, chocolate kept in the backpack of a person in Hatchotarumi melted, and a part of his hair was discolored. The melting temperature of typical chocolate is approximately 30  °C and that of the discolored part of hair is > 100  °C in hot air (e.g., Yamashita et al. 2012). The estimated temperature of the PDCs accompanying the eruption was higher than or equal to that of the 2012 eruption of Te Maari Volcano (100 – 64  °C in proximal, 51 – 58  °C in distal: Efford et al. 2014), and lower than that of the 1900 eruption of Adatara Volcano (over 100  °C, under 400  °C: Fujinawa et al. 2006).|$|R
