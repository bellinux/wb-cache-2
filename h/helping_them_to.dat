5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, <b>helping</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero {{was created}} from a {{partnership}} between RedOctane, then their own company that produced specialized video game controllers, and Harmonix, a music video game development company who had previously produced Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution. RedOctane was seeking {{to bring in a}} Guitar Freaks-like game, highly popular in Japan at the time, into Western markets, and approached Harmonix about <b>helping</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> develop a music game involving a guitar controller. Both companies agreed to it, and went on to produce Guitar Hero in 2005. The title was highly successful, leading to the development of its successful sequel Guitar Hero II in 2006. While the original controllers for the first Guitar Hero game were designed by Ryan Lesser, Rob Kay, Greg LoPiccolo and Alex Rigopulous of Harmonix and built by the Honeybee Corporation of China, subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at RedOctane, with development led primarily by Jack McCauley.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, a new Greek Revival {{octagonal}} synagogue {{designed by}} architect P.J. Krouse and modelled after the Temple of Athena Nike was {{built at the}} corner of 11th Street and 24th Avenue. The marble steps leading to the entrance of the building were flanked by large Ionic columns. The new synagogue could seat 500 and featured stained glass windows displaying the Ten Commandments, a menorah, the Star of David, and Noah's Ark. A fire damaged the building during its first year of operation, and while it was being repaired, services were held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. By 1907, the congregation had grown to include 82 members and was led by Rabbi Max Raisin. By 1927, the Jewish community in Meridian had grown to 525 people, partly due to an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe. The members of Beth Israel sponsored these newcomers, <b>helping</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> find jobs and homes and holding night classes to teach them English.|$|E

Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, <b>helping</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E
