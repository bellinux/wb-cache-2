5|$|A <b>direct</b> <b>method</b> for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E

40|$|Stability {{analysis}} {{programs are}} a primary tool used by power system planning and operating engineers {{to predict the}} response of the system to various disturbances. Important conclusions and decisions are made {{based on the results of}} stability studies. The conventional method of analyzing stability is to calculate the transient behavior of generators due to a given disturbance. By examining the behavior of generators, one determines whether stability has been maintained or lost. In contrast, <b>direct</b> <b>methods</b> of stability analysis identifi whether or not the system will remain stable once the disturbance is removed by comparing it with a calculated threshold value. <b>Direct</b> <b>methods</b> not only avoid the time-consuming solutions required in the conventional method, but also provide a quantitative measure of the degree of system stability. This additional information makes <b>direct</b> <b>methods</b> very attractive when the relative stability of different plans must be compared or when stability limits must be calculated quickly.

The simplest and most <b>direct</b> <b>method</b> proved {{to be in a}} predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere.

The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center.
