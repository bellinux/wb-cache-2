40|$|Abstract. A new Passage Airbag (PAB) <b>folding</b> <b>method</b> which {{integrates}} simulation folding and manual folding is presented. Determining {{how to get}} a multi-layer 2 D {{surface is}} vital to PAB folding. By means of 3 D PAB flattening process simulation, 2 D surface with a minimum area loss is created. This method avoids the traditional measurement of real PAB to obtain 2 D airbag with inaccurate shape and size. After flattening PAB simulation, the 2 D surfaces are meshed with respect to the predefined folding lines. The subsequent folding steps of flat 2 D airbag are carried out according to the folding requirements. Finally, the reference geometry meshing and folded airbag are obtained accurately and rapidly. The static PAB deployment test is modeled using particle method for gas flow to validate this <b>folding</b> <b>method.</b> Good correlation between simulation and test results during early deployment phase of airbag is achieved.

40|$|There is a {{resurgence}} of interest in RNA secondary structure prediction problem (a. k. a. the RNA folding problem) due {{to the discovery of}} many new families of non-coding RNAs with a variety of functions. The vast majority of the computational tools for RNA secondary structure prediction are based on free energy minimization. Here the goal is to compute a non-conflicting collection of structural elements such as hairpins, bulges and loops, whose total free energy is as small as possible. Perhaps the most commonly used tool for structure prediction, mfold/RNAfold, is designed to fold a single RNA sequence. More recent methods, such as RNAscf and alifold are developed to improve the prediction quality of this tool by aiming to minimize the free energy of a number of functionally similar RNA sequences simultaneously. Typically, the (stack) prediction quality of the latter approach improves as the number of sequences to be folded and/or the similarity between the sequences increase. If the number of available RNA sequences to be folded is small then the predictive power of multiple sequence <b>folding</b> <b>methods</b> can deteriorate to that of the single sequence <b>folding</b> <b>methods</b> or worse...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{parametric}} model method and simulate the deployment mechanism of inflatable antenna structures. Different <b>folded</b> <b>methods</b> are {{developed for the}} primary members of inflatable antenna structures, which include inflatable tubes, an inflatable torus, a reflector etc. The unstressed configuration and the folded configuration of these members are modeled parametrically using the developed <b>folded</b> <b>methods.</b> A simulation software is developed for the deployment mechanism of inflatable structures by the improved spring-mass system. The driving forces in the deployment process, i. e. the gas pressure and {{the moment of the}} fold hinges, are analyzed for each member. During the development process, self-contact or collision with the membrane occurs. A rule for identifying self-contact elements is applied, and a penalty function method is developed to solve this challenging problem. Finally, the equation of motion is solved using finite difference method. The developed simulation software is validated by simulating a cylindrical inflatable tube that is folded in half, and the simulation agrees well with the experiment. The deployment mechanism of the antenna model similar to that for the Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) is modeled, analyzed and estimated. The deployed configurations and the dynamic parameters of each node are obtained. The numerical simulation results show that the simulation software for the deployment mechanism can correctly predict the deployment process of inflatable antenna structures...|$|R
