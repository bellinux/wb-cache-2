I am fiscally conservative: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the deficit}} and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat {{that we need to}} address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe it is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E

However, Coco McPherson, {{who is in charge}} of Rolling Stone's fact-checking operation, said, [...] "I one-hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed." [...] Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: [...] "It's not like <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fuse in August 2012, Q-Tip confirmed that {{he was working with}} Carey on material for her fourteenth studio album. In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry with me because he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. He loves me, we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him soon... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get that ready."

500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E

[...] To decentralize neighborhood services is something <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{take a close look}} at."

[...] Asked why there wasn't more coverage of the mental health issues outside of this and other gun violence tragedies, Napolitano told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. [...] "Unfortunately it does not hit the radar scope in Washington or almost in any state house ...

2500|$|At {{least one}} {{psychologist}} warned that Survive This risked being exploitative and might damage {{the mental health}} of the participants.

[...] "It's okay to have some competition, it's okay to try out for things," [...] she says. [...] "Those are okay lessons for kids. But doing it on national television, to be watched and judged, that's where I feel it's a little bit exploitive, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consider {{the mental health of}} the kids that are on that show." [...] But other mental health experts declared the show safe, concluding that the participants merely displayed strong competitiveness and that social ostracization was largely avoided.|$|E

So their offers were a bit suspect anyway, and they tended to vary in content hour by hour, day by day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> examine the credibility of those offers before we leap to conclusions that such offers were in fact real..."

2500|$|Reform of {{the office}} is usually only {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a New Zealand republic. Helen Clark, when defending Dame Silvia Cartwright following a political controversy over prison sentences, stated [...] "ne of the challenges for us is we clearly are no longer a dominion of Britain where the Governor-General is exactly like the Queen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consider how the role of governor-general might evolve further. As you know, my view is that one day there will be a president fulfilling the kind of role the governor-general does." [...] Others, such as Professor Noel Cox have argued that the Governor-General's role needs to be updated, rather than reforming the office. Some constitutional academics expressed concern that the process of electoral reform could result in the Governor-General having greater political influence. In 1993, the then Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard caused controversy by suggesting that under the proposed Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, the Governor-General may have to use their reserve powers more often. Following the adoption of MMP at a referendum later in 1993, Prime Minister Jim Bolger suggested at the opening of parliament in 1994 that one reason New Zealand might move to a republic was that the Governor-General would have more influence under the new electoral system.|$|E

So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our unique selling point. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction from your own life, it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary creative director. Kent said, [...] "John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean's legacy while we recruit a long-term successor." ...|$|E
