5|$|Australia batted {{much more}} productively {{in the second}} innings in ideal weather on the third day. Morris and Barnes put on 122 before the former fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease for his last Test innings {{at the home of}} cricket. Yardley {{surrounded}} the Australian captain with fielders and Laker then beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was then introduced with the leg trap ploy again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads. The Australian captain decided to negate the danger of being caught <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> short fine leg by padding the ball away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of Bradman's bat three times in a row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes then manipulated the strike to shield his captain from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap, and negated the danger Bedser was posing. Bradman accelerated after tea and took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty, with Barnes on 96 and Australia at 1/222.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, Cabot {{announced}} that a mistake {{had been made in}} the front cover summary of Valentine Princess. Since the book chronicles Mia <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> her old diaries, the characters Boris and Tina were not dating, rather Boris and Lilly. On the book flap, however, it says Boris and Tina are a couple. Cabot has {{announced that}} this has been fixed by the publishing company. Tina was dating Dave Farouq El-Abar at the time of books one and two.|$|E

25|$|Although The Wonderful Wizard of Oz {{was very}} profitable, the family {{remained}} low on cash in 1900 near Christmas. The book's initial royalty was {{slated to be}} given to Frank in January. However, Maud told Frank to ask for it in advance to purchase Christmas gifts. Begrudgingly, Frank requested and received the money, pocketing it. Not <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> the money, Frank returned home, finding Maud ironing his shirt. He gave her the money after she asked for it, whereupon she became shocked. Anticipating it to be no more than $100, Maud was delighted to learn that the check was for $3,432.64. Maud misremembered the iron during the ensuing flurry and burned Frank's shirt.|$|E
25|$|Close {{examination}} of affected features {{show that the}} doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated minutely from the original. When casually <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> a coin, the difference {{is not easy to}} tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter.|$|E

[...] He alleges that Hitler {{fell in love with}} her after she passed by him during her daily daughter-mother stroll in Linz, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> him. In Kubizek's account, although in love with her to the point of suicide, Hitler never once spoke with her, and she later married an Austrian army officer. Stefanie stated in interviews that she was unaware of Hitler's feelings towards her, and little is known about her life.|$|E

2500|$|His song [...] "The Power of Love" [...] was a No. 1 U.S. hit and {{featured}} in the 1985 film Back to the Future, for which they also recorded the song, [...] "Back in Time." [...] Lewis has a cameo appearance in the film as a faculty member who rejects Marty McFly's band's audition for the school's [...] "Battle of the Bands" [...] contest. As an inside joke, the piece the band plays is an instrumental heavy metal version of [...] "The Power of Love." [...] (The committee leader's response, after <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> an unimpressed Lewis: [...] "Hold it, fellas ... I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.") [...] "The Power of Love" [...] was nominated for an Academy Award.|$|E
2500|$|On the Laserdisc audio commentary, Scorsese {{acknowledged}} several critics' {{interpretation of}} the film's ending as being Bickle's dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> an unseen object implies that Bickle might fall into rage and recklessness in the future, and he is like [...] "a ticking time bomb". Writer Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis [...] "is not cured by the movie's end", and that [...] "he's {{not going to be}} a hero next time." [...] When asked on the website Reddit about the film's ending, Schrader said that it was not to be taken as a dream sequence, but that he envisioned it as returning to the beginning of the film—as if the last frame [...] "could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Felt {{was unaware}} of {{impending}} eventsas was Harkinsand hurried to Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base for his noon flight. Before leaving, he {{held a press conference}} with Harkins and Đôn while the rebels were rolling into the city. Harkins spoke about the military situation with optimism; {{on the morning of the}} coup, the front page of the Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper, featured a piece with Harkins' sunny outlook, entitled [...] "Viet Victory Near". While Felt and Harkins were talking, the officers were preparing to launch the coup at a lunchtime meeting at military headquarters next to the airport. Thinking of the situation, Đôn kept <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> his watch while waiting for Felt to fly out. The three men were standing as they talked, and Đôn, overcome by nerves, chewed his gum [...] "like a threshing machine", and could not stand still, frequently changing his footing as he talked. After Felt left, the runway was closed, and Đôn brushed off Harkins and quickly went away to get ready for the coup.|$|E
2500|$|In the 196667 European Cup, Celtic progressed {{through the}} first two rounds with {{relatively}} comfortable wins against Zurich and Nantes. Celtic then faced Yugoslav side Vojvodina, who Chalmers later described as [...] "the best team we played in the whole tournament". A miss-kick by Tommy Gemmell allowed Vojvodina to score the only goal of the first leg, played in Yugoslavia. In the return game, Celtic drew the aggregate score level with a goal by Chalmers in the 58th minute. Stein was agitated during the game, frequently <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> his watch. Near the end, he remarked to Sean Fallon that [...] "it looks like bloody Rotterdam!", citing where a play-off match would have been held if the tie had finished level. Instead, McNeill headed in a tie-winning goal from a corner kick during injury time. Celtic then defeated Dukla Prague 31 in the first (home) leg of the semi-final, with Wallace scoring twice. In the return game, Celtic sustained heavy pressure but held out for a goalless draw. It became a common belief that Stein had abandoned his attacking principles for that game, but Bobby Lennox, McNeill and Chalmers all later said that Stein had not set out defensive tactics beforehand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Di Grassi was delighted with his victory, calling it [...] "the best day in my Formula E career" [...] and reserved praise for his team after they used much of their energy to understand their lack of competitiveness at the preceding New York City races. He felt the secret was to remain calm and exercise what the driver could do to motivate the people he/she is surrounded by for the season's remaining races, [...] "Formula E can go from heaven to hell in one lap or one decision or one problem. Today we did the job. Tomorrow is a completely different day, a completely different environment. We’re {{going to try to}} do the same as we did here.” Vergne spoke of his happiness over his team's growing strength and their double podium finish. He said he was hit from both sides at the race's start, causing him to lose positions, but spoke highly of his car, [...] " [...] I thought the car was just perfect and was able to push really hard. I was catching everyone in front, using less energy than them, so I think the strategy was really nice.” Third-place finisher Sarrazin stated that he was down on pace and became aware of Buemi closing on him by <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> his rear-view mirrors. However, he was aware Buemi was challenging for the championship.|$|E
