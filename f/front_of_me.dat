5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. I felt it was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{influence}} {{with the public}} was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated it into her Coq au Riesling recipe on Nigella Express. In December 2007 she appeared on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and revealed that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet, saying [...] "How stupid to challenge me!

500|$|Riefenstahl heard Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler {{speak at}} a rally in 1932 and was mesmerized by his talent as a public speaker. Describing the {{experience}} in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote, [...] "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth".|$|E
60|$|The yarn had not {{yet come}} to an end when a commotion among the men in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> us caused <b>me</b> to crane my neck to look in the {{direction}} many were pointing, and there I saw the lines of red marching directly toward us in perfect order, as if on parade.|$|R

500|$|Completing the field, Kazuki Nakajima was 16th, Nelson Piquet Jr. 17th, Rubens Barrichello 18th, whilst the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella {{brought up}} {{the rear of the}} grid in 19th and 20th positions. Piquet later complained that he was blocked during his first-session run by Vettel: [...] "During my lap, Vettel was in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> which {{unsettled}} me a little, although the FIA felt that he did not impede me." [...] Kovalainen was, however, penalized by the stewards and fined €5,000 for using a refuelling system during qualifying which had not been approved by the FIA.|$|E
500|$|In a 2013 interview, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that they partied heavily during {{the production of}} Follow the Leader, with massive amounts of alcohol, drugs, {{and women in the}} studio. Davis explained further, saying that while recording the vocals for [...] "It's On", there were [...] "people getting blowjobs right behind me, there was girls banging each other in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> people getting boned in the closet right behind me, it was the craziest shit I've {{ever seen in my life}} and I sang that song." [...] According to Davis, he only agreed to begin tracking vocals when producer Toby Wright met his demands for an eight-ball (a one-eighth ounce of cocaine).|$|E
500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of how she would look in the video. I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band for her to see. I did it all in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E

60|$|I wish I {{knew what}} he thought of the whole performance; but a friend of the lean man, who sat just in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Arick, tells <b>me</b> what seemed to startle him most. The first thing was when two of the {{officers}} came out with blackened faces, like minstrels, and began to dance. Arick was sure that they were really black, and his own people, and he was wonderfully surprised to see them dance in this new European style.|$|R
6000|$|The painter {{stared at}} him. [...] "My dear boy, what nonsense!" [...] he cried. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} say you don't like what I did of you? Where is it?

500|$|After the campaign, {{it emerged}} that Agnew {{had failed to}} report three alleged {{attempts}} to bribe him, made {{on behalf of the}} slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000 and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in Southern Maryland. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: [...] "Nobody sat down in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> with a suitcase of money." [...] Agnew was also criticized over his part-ownership of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over Chesapeake Bay. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew's partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|However, McClellan soon {{received}} a miraculous break of fortune. Union soldiers accidentally found {{a copy of}} Lee's orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home." [...] He telegraphed President Lincoln: [...] "I have the whole rebel force in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ... Will send you trophies." ...|$|E

500|$|Baird's {{mother was}} struck and killed on 15 July 1958, just outside Mimi's home, by a Standard Vanguard car {{driven by an}} off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a learner-driver. Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I swear it. It {{was just one of}} those terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. [...] Her grave is unmarked, and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805".|$|E
500|$|There are {{important}} locations featured in Air {{that are based}} on places in the city Kami in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Air is set in the Kasumi district of Kami; {{during the course of the}} series' creation, Kasumi was an individual town that has since merged with two others to form the city of Kami. Many of the locales in Air, such as the seawall, the train station, the shrine, and the school are based on real places. As Air is set in the middle of summer, the season offers bright, sunny skies for the town during the day.Translated quote: [...] "In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> is an unchecked, wide open sky. No obscuring objects whatsoever. The sunlight oscillated down." [...] In the manga adaptation, the town is described as a [...] "quiet town with few people...with nothing but beaches and countryside." [...] Scenario assistant Yūichi Suzumoto has commented that his impression of Air is similar to that of a folk song due to the rural setting and heartwarming story progression.|$|E
500|$|As Ribbentrop's tanks spread out, {{he and the}} 1st SS-Panzer Regiment were {{suddenly}} confronted by Soviet tanks of the 29th Tank Corps' 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades: [...] "About 150–200 meters in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> appeared fifteen, then thirty, then forty tanks. Finally {{there were too many}} of them to count." [...] The Soviet armour, firing on the move, charged down the western slopes of Hill 252.2 into the panzer company, and a tank battle ensued. Rotmistrov's tactic to close at high speed disrupted the control and co-ordination of the Soviet tank formations and also greatly reduced their accuracy. In a three-hour battle, the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment engaged the attacking Soviet tanks and repulsed them, reporting that they destroyed about 62 Soviet tanks. Later that afternoon, tanks from the 31st Tank Brigade and the 53rd Motorized Brigade overran elements of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion and reached Komsomolets State Farm, threatening Leibstandarte lines of communication and the division's command post located at Hill 241.6. The Soviet tanks attacked the division's 1st SS-Panzer Artillery Regiment, killing some of the crews before they themselves were destroyed by direct fire from anti-tank teams.|$|E
5000|$|... "I passed {{one that}} looked as if it was hanging {{motionless}} in the air (I am too fast!). The one above me went into a steep right-hand turn, his pale blue underside standing out against the purple sky. Another banked right in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Me's</b> nose. Violent jolt as I flew through his airscrew eddies. Maybe a wing's length away. That one in the gentle left-hand curve! Swing her round. I was coming from underneath, eye glued to the sight (pull her tighter!). A throbbing in the wings as my cannon pounded briefly. Missed him. Way behind his tail. It was exasperating. I {{would never be able to}} shoot one down like this. They were like a sack of fleas. A prick of doubt: is this really such a good fighter? Could one in fact, successfully attack a group of erratically banking fighters with the Me 262?" [...] Johannes Steinhoff, Luftwaffe fighter ace.|$|R

500|$|The Times {{gave the}} game four stars {{out of five}} {{and said it was}} [...] "more for 24 fans, who will {{instantly}} love it — so long as they don’t mind another TV addiction to feed." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, [...] "Newcomers to the trials and tribulations of Jack Bauer are unlikely to be impressed by this game's generic shooting and driving action. But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> And the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E

5000|$|Further, Johnny's early {{adulthood}} {{was marked by}} bouts of delinquency which he attested were inexplicable at the time. [...] "I didn't become a delinquent until I got out of high school. I had a two-year run. I'd go out and hit kids and take their money and rob everybody's pocketbooks. Just being bad every minute of the day. It was terrible. I don't know what my problem was. Things that were funny {{to me at the}} time were horrible. If I found a television set sitting in the garbage, I'd take it up to the rooftop, watch for someone walking down the block and drop it in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them on the sidewalk. It was funny watching them see a TV set come crashing down 30 feet in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. To <b>me</b> it was hysterical, {{but it was also a}} mean and terrible thing to do. I also found a way of stopping the elevator. I could open up the door and stop the elevator. I would wait for an old lady to get in and stop the elevator. They'd be yelling and pushing the alarm, and I would keep them there. At about 20 years old, I stopped drinking and doing drugs, got a job and tried to be normal." ...|$|R
