50|$|In May 2005, {{interest}} in custom <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> installations was booming. While auto manufacturers were equipping cars with less powerful horns, the latest customization fad of high powered <b>air</b> <b>horns</b> was rapidly gaining popularity. Most older cars were equipped with robust multi-tone <b>air</b> <b>horns,</b> but in modern production automobiles these were {{being replaced by}} smaller single tone electric horns. In Florida, the home state of HornBlasters, Inc., actual railway-use <b>air</b> <b>horns</b> were being installed on vehicles. These custom <b>air</b> <b>horns</b> are so loud that people standing near the horn can feel the blast of air as its honked.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>horns</b> {{have been}} used as jokes, and running gags in {{cartoons}} and movies. In the Jackass television series and movies, <b>air</b> <b>horns</b> are occasionally used to frighten people.|$|R
50|$|In trucks, the <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> {{is powered}} with {{compressed}} {{air from the}} vehicle's air brake system. A cord mounted on {{the ceiling of the}} operator's cab is pulled to open the valve, supplying varying amounts of <b>air</b> to the <b>horn.</b> Thus, an outstretched hand reaching upward and pumping is a signal to the driver of an <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> equipped vehicle, requesting a toot. In modern trucks the horn is actuated by a button on the steering wheel (just like a normal car horn). Some trucks have both electric and <b>air</b> <b>horn,</b> selectable by a switch on the dashboard. This is to prevent the use of the powerful <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> in populated areas.|$|R
50|$|Terror on the Streets is {{an online}} web series, {{originally}} published on HornBlasters.com in June 2005, featuring various <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> and public address pranks. In the series, unsuspecting pedestrians are caught being startled with <b>air</b> <b>horns,</b> gentlemen's club patrons are taunted, and even {{police officers are}} caught off guard. This web series reached its peak popularity in the Summer of 2006 and helped promote public interest in <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> upgrades for vehicles.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was studied to saving energy of <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> dryer with closed-loop oscillating heat pipe (CLOHP/CV). The CLOHP/CV {{made from a}} copper tube with inner diameter of 2 mm. The evaporator and condenser lengths were 18 cm. The adiabatic length was 20 cm. Distilled water with 50 % by total volume of tube was filled into CLOHP/CV. The number of meanderings was 40. The temperature for testing was 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 oC. The <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> flow rate was 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 m/s. The results of the normal <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> dryer and the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> dryer with CLOHP/CV, {{it was found that}} the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> dryer with CLOHP/CV can save thermal energy more than the normal <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> dryer.

40|$|Dried fish is {{commonly}} produced by convective <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> drying. Microwave technology {{was presented in}} this paper to improve both process and product quality. Catfish (order Siluriformes) slices were dehydrated in a microwave assisted <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> convective dehydration (MWHA) system to investigate the effects of microwave power and <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature on drying time, dehydration behaviour, energy consumption and colour of dried fish. Three different microwave power outputs namely medium (373 W), medium low (217 W) and low (91 W) combined with convective <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature of 40 °C, 70 °C and 130 °C accordingly were employed in the drying experiments. Results show that microwave accelerates drying time up to 120 folds faster compared to drying with <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> convective alone. It was also noted that increasing the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature was not as significant as increasing the microwave power in reducing the drying time. Experiments show that drying time was reduced about 75 % when an increase of microwave power from low (91 W) to medium mode (373 W) combining with convective <b>hot</b> <b>air.</b> However, drying with microwave alone required longer drying time. Energy consumption analysis shows that microwave assisted drying process requires less energy usage. Drying fish with microwave assisted <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> dehydration treatment make the colour brighter, shifting towards red and yellow...|$|R
