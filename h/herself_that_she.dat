25|$|In 1975, the German {{psychoanalyst}} {{and family}} therapist Helm Stierlin published his book Adolf Hitler. Familienperspektiven, {{in which he}} {{raised the question of}} the psychological and motivational bases for Hitler's aggression and passion for destruction, similarly to Fromm. His study focuses heavily on Hitler’s relationship to his mother, Klara. Stierlin felt that Hitler's mother had frustrated hopes for <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> strongly delegated to her son, even though for him, too, they were impossible to satisfy.|$|E

In the interview with the Observer, she revealed that she had attempted to hide her condition, {{since she was a}} teenager, and had tried to make her body as healthy as possible to compensate for the condition. In the interview, she said that she became an overachiever in an effort to tell <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was okay.|$|E

25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and <b>herself,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

Soon the youth of the city are converging upon the courtyard of Buda Castle, dancing and lighting up the night with their fireworks.|$|E
500|$|She {{continued}} to work {{in spite of her}} illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of The Elliots, she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began The Brothers (titled Sanditon when published in 1925), and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes Sanditons heroine, Diana Parker, as an [...] "energetic invalid". In the novel, Austen mocked hypochondriacs and though she describes the heroine as [...] "bilious", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was turning [...] "every wrong colour" [...] and living [...] "chiefly on the sofa". She put down her pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.|$|E

Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his pole-cat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that [...] "Sredni Vashtar" [...] will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts to dispose of the animal, it attacks and kills her. [...] The entire household is shocked and alarmed, but Conradin calmly butters another piece of toast.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{is a fan of}} Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked at herself in the mirror and cried.|$|E

2500|$|In the meantime, the anime {{follows a}} complex game of hide-and-seek between the [...] "Knights of the Eastern Calculus", hackers whom Masami claims are [...] "believers that {{enable him to}} be a God in the Wired", and Tachibana General Laboratories, who try to regain control of Protocol Seven. In the end, the viewer sees Lain realizing, after much introspection, that she has {{absolute}} control over everyone's mind and over reality itself. Her dialogue with different versions of herself shows how she feels shunned from the material world, and how she is afraid to live in the Wired, where she has the possibilities and responsibilities of an almighty goddess. The last scenes feature her erasing everything connected to herself from everyone's memories. She is last seen, unchanged, encountering her oldest and closest friend Alice once again, who is now married. Lain promises <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and Alice will surely meet again anytime as Lain can literally go and be anywhere she desires between both worlds.|$|E
2500|$|Jameson's first adult video {{appearances}} were lesbian scenes (a common {{way that}} female performers ease into the business). She says: [...] "Girl-on-girl was easy and natural. Then they offered me {{lots of money}} to do boy-girl." [...] Her first heterosexual scene was in Up and Cummers 11 (1994). At {{the beginning of her}} career, she promised <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would never do anal sex or double penetration scenes on film. Instead, her [...] "signature move" [...] was oral sex, lubricated with saliva. She has also never done any interracial sex scenes with men (despite that category's runaway popularity during the 2000s). When asked about this on The Howard Stern Show on February 8, 2008, she said that she was not necessarily opposed to doing so; rather, [...] "it never really came up", as there were few black men working in porn when she started, and none of them worked [...] for the same company [...] she did.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim. [...] After {{questioning}} Ado Annie {{about their}} relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint {{to agree to}} marry her.

[...] Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and <b>herself)</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does not love him ("People Will Say We're in Love"). [...] Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him. [...] Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him ("Pore Jud Is Daid"). [...] Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride ("Lonely Room").|$|E

With no self-esteem, Matina has assured <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> probably {{never going to get}} married, although she often tries to attract men. She has a constant crush on Konstantinos and Nicolas, with the latter becoming her boyfriend in the penultimate episode.|$|R
2500|$|Penny {{confesses to}} Sam that she doesn't really like bad boys, and only dates them {{to prove to}} <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is not a boring person, but she likes Carrie Underwood, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry. Sam confesses he has similar {{interests}} and they kiss, and he takes her to the auditorium to watch Jake, Unique, Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) perform a stripped-down version of [...] "Wide Awake". Jake later convinces Marley to dress up like Katy Perry for him, but they get into a fight when Marley claims she is {{not yet ready to}} have sex with him. The following day, Jake seduces Bree and they have sex in the school grounds. Bree also informs Principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) of the assignment, and Sue suspends the entire glee club for a week for dressing inappropriately on school grounds. Will refuses to back down to Sue despite her new position, and New Directions later meets at the auditorium, where they defiantly perform [...] "Roar", a song also performed by Pamela Lansbury, now with its full complement of performers, and the episode ends.|$|E
2500|$|The {{property}} behind Stimson House (on Chester Place) was {{the home}} of Carrie Estelle Doheny, the widow of wealthy oil man, Edward L. Doheny. [...] Mrs. Doheny {{had grown up in}} the neighborhood and had watched as the Stimson House was built. [...] She recalled, [...] "I remember when Mr. Stimson was building this house. [...] When I was just a little girl, my father would take me for a walk on Sunday afternoons, and we’d always walk this way to see how far along the work had progressed." [...] For eight years from 1940 to 1948, Mrs. Doheny lived behind the fraternity, and the boisterous parties in the house’s dungeon-like [...] "catacombs" [...] were an ongoing source of annoyance. [...] Mrs. Doheny repeatedly complained to the university president, Rufus B. Von Kleinsmid, about disturbances, a former house president recalling that he was called before Kleinsmid [...] "once a month or so" [...] {{as a result of her}} complaints. [...] By 1948, Mrs. Doheny had dealt with the fraternity for long enough and offered $75,000 to purchase the house that the fraternity bought eight years earlier for $20,000. [...] The fraternity house was already struggling with the cost of maintaining the large house and accepted Mrs. Doheny’s offer. [...] After the sale closed, Mrs. Doheny assured <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have no further problems with noisy neighbors by deeding Stimson House to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet for use as a convent. [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times noted: [...] "The parlor where merry parties reveled at the turn of the century will become a chapel where reverent nuns will now bow in humble devotion. [...] The gay conversation of the festive past will yield place to solemn intonations of morning prayers." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is the {{one moment}} in the songwriters' {{original}} score where Lansbury's character [...] "Eglantine" [...] demonstratively sings about her lonely existence. The lyric accomplishes this by Lansbury singing the opposite sentiment. In the lyric she tries to convince <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> better off on her own. The melody line is far more melancholy, however, which enhances {{the irony of the}} lyric. The Sherman Brothers felt that the song's loss was a devastating blow to the storyline, as its removal undermined Lansbury's character motivation.|$|R
5000|$|... "So What" [...] {{carries an}} {{energetic}} vibe. The song {{consists of a}} powerful charging beat, a singalong chorus, and a synthesizer backing influenced by club music. The song is in the key of F# minor. The initial riff is closely familiar to Deep Purple's [...] "Black Night". Lyrically, the song chronicles the protagonist's adventures following her separation from her husband. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noted that the song has a hint of desperation in the lines [...] "I don’t want you tonight, I’m alright, I'm just fine", implying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is spending time convincing <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> <b>she’s</b> enjoying the single life.|$|R

She becomes the one who's doing things. There was dialogue to that.
