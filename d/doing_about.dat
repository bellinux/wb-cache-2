It was reported that he was <b>doing</b> <b>about</b> 150mph, 100mph over the speed limit. On June 2, 2008, Ne-Yo pleaded guilty to the driving without a valid license charge and no contest to the reckless driving charge. He was sentenced to 24 hours of community service.|$|E
25|$|After several months, it {{appeared}} that the Times bombers had gotten clean away. The union decided it was time for more bombings in Los Angeles, and sent Ortie McManigal with a list of five bombing targets, including the Times auxiliary printing plant, the Llewellyn Iron Works, the Baker Iron Works, and two nonunion construction sites: the Los Angeles County Hall of Records and the Hotel Alexandria. J. J. McNamara told McManigal that he had promised the “coast bunch” a Christmas present, and wanted the explosions to take place on Christmas Day. McManigal set off a dynamite bomb at the Llewellyn Iron Works, partially wrecking the plant and <b>doing</b> <b>about</b> $25,000 in damages, but he found two of the other sites too closely guarded, and never visited the remaining two. J. J. McNamara was angry that only one of the sites was bombed, but McManigal told him that security was too tight.|$|E

500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been <b>doing</b> <b>about,</b> you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] was filmed in December 2004 in Los Angeles, California. It was co-directed by Spears and Billie Woodruff, who {{previously}} {{worked with her}} in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and in [...] "Overprotected". Spears described the shoot as [...] "hectic", adding it was filmed [...] "in a record-breaking five hours". She also commented about co-directing with Woodruff, saying that [...] "he had no ego whatsoever, and the whole process was just so much fun". Spears is credited as [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] in the video, as she said [...] "I kinda think she's like my alter ego whenever I feel like being mean or possibly like bustin' people around to get stuff right... It's kinda easier to be called 'Mona Lisa' instead of Britney". The video was also choreographed and styled entirely by Spears, with clothing from Juicy Couture. Spears ultimately added that working behind the camera inspired her to become a director in the future, explaining, [...] "After <b>doing</b> <b>about</b> 20 videos, it gets kind of boring playing the same role. I feel like being behind the camera is sometimes more satisfying than being in front of it".|$|E

500|$|Further {{aerodynamic}} refinements {{were carried}} out in Exeter {{with the development of}} new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, [...] "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a [...] "proper" [...] electric car. He said later that he thought [...] "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." [...] Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, [...] "asking what we were <b>doing</b> <b>about</b> visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications...". It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him. He later described his contribution as [...] "convert an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device".|$|E
