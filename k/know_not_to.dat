5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet <b>know</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, {{has been able to}} do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.|$|E
25|$|Jordan's first band, drawn {{mainly from}} members of the Jesse Stone band, was {{originally}} a nine-piece group, but he soon scaled it down to a sextet after landing a residency at the Elks Rendezvous club, at 464 Lenox Avenue, in Harlem. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing, as Louie Jordan's Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled Louie so people would <b>know</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> pronounce it Lewis.|$|E
25|$|The Rawk {{is a large}} boulder {{donated by}} members of Alpha Phi Omega in 1973 and painted nearly every day by {{students}}, who {{use it as a}} giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students <b>know</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.|$|E

25|$|The guidon is a {{great source}} of pride for the unit, and several {{military}} traditions have developed around it, stemming back from ancient times. Any sort of disgrace toward the guidon is considered a dishonor of the unit as a whole, and punishment is typical. For example, should the guidon bearer drop the guidon, they must fall with it and perform punishment, often in the form of push-ups. Other units may attempt to steal the guidon to demoralize or antagonize the unit. Veteran soldiers <b>know</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give up the guidon to anyone outside their unit, but new recruits may be tempted into relinquishing it by a superior, especially during a unit run.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Christian {{teaching}} of Father Richard Rohr, {{the concept of}} the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), [...] "but they <b>know</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." [...] Rohr refers to this level of awareness as [...] "having the mind of Christ".|$|E
