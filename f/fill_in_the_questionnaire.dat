Reliability analysis showed a high Cronbach’s alpha:. 814. Item-to-Total correlations and Principal Component Analysis lead to the deletion of 10 questions. The adjusted version of the questionnaire was used in the second stage of this study. Seven aphasics and 4 partners participated and the questionnaire contained 28 questions. Reliability analysis showed that the questionnaire is homogeneous: Cronbach’s alpha was. 846. Validity was not officially checked. However, it can be assumed that the questionnaire is valid because the domains in the questionnaire correspond with the domains The WHOQoL Group (1994) defined in their definition of quality of life.
