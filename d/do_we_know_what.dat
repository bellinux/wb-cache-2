[...] "But what a comfort it is that Rebecca's come: you will have her for a friend, and we may get rid now of this damn'd Irishwoman."

6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that, my dear. She told me, in so many words, that Farnaby owed her money. He didn't {{make his}} fortune all at once, I suppose. How <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{he might have done}} in his young days, or how he might have humbugged a feeble woman.

6000|$|... "Don't say that! You are free, {{you have}} money, you will travel {{about in the}} world and amuse yourself. In a week you will see more than stay-at-home people see in a year.

6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} thing. The noises from it went far to drown the voice of God, and bewildered some men so {{that they did not}} rightly <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the voice was saying.

6000|$|Does it {{not seem}} to you, then, on all these three counts, more than {{questionable}} whether we are assembled here in Kensington Museum to any good purpose? Might we not justly be looked upon with suspicion and fear, rather than with sympathy, by the innocent and unartistical public? Are we even sure of ourselves? <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we are about? Are we met here as honest people? or are we not rather so many Catilines assembled to devise the hasty degradation of our country, or, like a conclave of midnight witches, to summon and send forth, on new and unexpected missions, the demons of luxury, cruelty, and superstition? ...|$|E
6000|$|Genius, Poet: <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{these words}} mean? An {{inspired}} Soul once more vouchsafed us, direct from Nature's own great fire-heart, {{to see the}} Truth, and speak it, and do it; Nature's own sacred voice heard once more athwart the dreary boundless element of hearsaying and canting, of twaddle and poltroonery, in which the bewildered Earth, nigh perishing, has lost its way. Hear once more, ye bewildered benighted mortals; listen once again to {{a voice from the}} inner Light-sea and Flame-sea, Nature's and Truth's own heart; know the Fact of your Existence what it is, put away the Cant of it which it is not; and knowing, do, and let it be well with you!-- ...|$|E

I suppose it's inhumane, but mine is a monstrously interesting trade, even in a little place like this. As for that girl, of course I've known her all her life, and--but--but {{that is just the}} question. Have I known her all her life? Have I known her at all? Was she even there to be known? You admire her for telling the truth; and so she did, by God, when she said that some people wake up late, who have never lived before. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they might do--we, who have only seen them asleep?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{is such a}} life worth? It's {{all very}} {{comfortable}} for us to say, 'They don't feel it.' How <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they feel? What do we know of their capacity for enjoyment of art and music? They never have leisure or opportunity. The master is very glad to be taught by preacher, and lawyer, and novelist, that his slaves are contented and never feel any longings for a higher life. These people live lives but little higher than their cattle--are forced to live so. Their hopes and aspirations are crushed out, their souls are twisted and deformed just as toil twists and deforms their bodies. They {{are on the same}} level as the city laborer. The very religion they hear is a soporific. They are taught to be content here that they may be happy hereafter. Suppose there isn't any hereafter?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ah me! {{how little}} <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{is coming to}} us! Irish cakes and ale were done and over for this world, we all thought. But in truth the Irish cakes were only then a-baking, and the Irish ale was being brewed. I {{am not sure that}} these good things are yet quite fit for the palates of the guest;--not as fit as a little more time will make them. The cake is still too new,--cakes often are; and the ale is not {{sufficiently}} mellowed. But of this I am sure, that the cakes and ale are there;--and the ginger, too, very hot in the mouth. Let a committee of Irish landlords say how the rents are paid now, and what amount of arrears was due through the country when the famine came among them. Rents paid to the day: that is the ginger hot in the mouth which best pleases the palate of a country gentleman.|$|E
6000|$|Lawford drew {{further into}} his pillow. 'Do {{as you think}} best, Sheila,' he said. 'For my own part, I believe it may be as he suggests--partly an illusion, a touch of nervous breakdown. It simply can't {{be as bad as}} I think it is. If it were, you would not be here talking like this; and Bethany wouldn't have {{believed}} a word I said. Whatever it is, it's no good crying it on the housetops. Give me time, just time. Besides, how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he really thought? Doctors don't tell their patients everything. Give the poor chap a chance, and more so if he is a foreigner. He's'--his voice sank almost to a whisper--'he's no darker than this. And do, please, Sheila, take this infernal stuff away, and let me have something solid. I'm not ill--in that way. All I want is peace and quiet, time to think. Let me fight it out alone. It's been sprung on me. The worst's not over. But I'll win through; wait! And if not--well, you shall not suffer, Sheila. Don't be afraid. There are other ways out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} miner grimly, [...] "something {{has got to}} be <b>done.</b> <b>We</b> let you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted. Haven't you {{anything}} to say?" ...|$|R

6000|$|If {{you look}} in the bills, you will see that the steamers leave London on Saturday morning, and Boulogne on Saturday night; so that there is often not an hour between the time of arrival and departure. Bless us! bless us! I pity the poor Captain that, for twenty-four hours at a time, is on a paddle-box, roaring out, [...] "Ease her! Stop her!" [...] and the poor servants, who are laying out breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, supper;--breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, supper again;--for layers upon layers of travellers, as it were; and most of all, I pity that unhappy steward, with those unfortunate tin-basins that he must always keep an eye over. Little <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a storm was {{brooding}} in our absence; and little were we prepared for the awful, awful fate that hung over our Tuggeridgeville property.|$|R
