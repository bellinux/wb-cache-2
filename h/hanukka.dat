In the days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, a shuk kapparot (kapparot market) opens beside the Mahane Yehuda Market, where patrons perform the custom of swinging a live chicken over their heads, symbolically transferring their sins to the chicken, which is then slaughtered and donated to the poor. During the days before the holiday of Sukkot, a large tent opposite the Market, in Valero Square, hosts a shuk arba minim (Four Species market), where vendors sell lulavs, etrogs, and other ritual items used on this holiday. [...] For other holidays with traditional foods, such as sufganiyot for <b>Hanukka</b> or hamentashen for Purim, the market offers many selections, sometimes with Purim hamentashen sold by vendors wearing holiday costumes.

It may also have begun in 18th-century Eastern Europe as a token of gratitude toward religious teachers, similar to the custom of tipping service people on Christmas. In 1958, the Bank of Israel issued commemorative coins for use as <b>Hanukka</b> gelt. That year, the coin bore the image of the same menorah that appeared on Maccabean coins 2,000 years ago.|$|E

40|$|Megillat Antiochos" {{is a small}} Aramaic scroll, {{containing}} {{the story of the}} Makkabean revolt. It is written between the second and fifth century CE, translated into Arabic in the tenth century and into Hebrew even later. It has been used during the service on <b>Hanukka,</b> at least in Yemen and Italy, but probably also elsewhere. It has been incorporated into Tenakh and Targum manuscripts, and prayer books for that purpose. This usage shows us that congregations can find flexible ways to add books to the canon, without giving them a real canonical position...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the chronological elements {{of the book of}} Judith reveals that the author distributes the events over a twelve month period, from Hanukkah to Hanukkah, which suggests the association of the book with the celebration of the dedication of the Temple. The chronology of the reign of Nabuchodonosor is borrowed from the Septuagint (967) of Daniel. The age of Judith possibly expresses the duration of the Lagide hegemony over Palestine.
