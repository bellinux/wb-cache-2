60|$|Perhaps a {{very little}} thought will now {{enable you to}} account for those {{repeated}} whaling disasters--some few of which are casually chronicled--of this man or that man being {{taken out of the}} boat by the line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated {{in the midst of the}} manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every <b>flying</b> <b>beam,</b> and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.|$|E

60|$|It rained the {{day they}} left St. Kentigern, and the next, {{and the day after}} that, spasmodically, as {{regarded}} local effort, sporadically, as seen through the filmed windows of railway carriages or from the shining decks of steamboats. There was always a shower being sown somewhere along the valley, or reluctantly tearing itself from a mountain-top, or being pulled into long threads from the leaden bosom of a lake; the coach swept in and out of them to the folding and unfolding of umbrellas and mackintoshes, accompanied by <b>flying</b> <b>beams</b> of sunlight that raced with the vehicle on long hillsides, and vanished {{at the turn of the}} road. There were hat-lifting scurries of wind down the mountain-side, small tumults in little lakes below, hysteric ebullitions on mild, melancholy inland seas, boisterous passages of nearly half an hour with landings on tempestuous miniature quays. All this seen through wonderful aqueous vapor, against a background of sky darkened at times to the depths of an India ink washed sketch, but more usually blurred and confused on the surface like the gray silhouette of a child's slate-pencil drawing, half rubbed from the slate by soft palms. Occasionally a rare glinting of real sunshine on a distant fringe of dripping larches made some frowning crest appear to smile as through wet lashes.|$|R

The operator guides the light beam around the path by means of a small hand joystick, training to gain proficiency to position the beam just above the target five seconds before the end of flight, then gently <b>flying</b> the <b>beam,</b> which represents the missile's flight, down on to the target for final impact.|$|R

The soft x-ray NRs are caused by the interference between the bulk ablated surface and nanometer-scale thin spallation layer; they originate from the metal surface at pump energy fluence of around 1 J/cm 2 and work as a <b>flying</b> soft x-ray <b>beam</b> splitter...|$|R

25|$|Exposure to {{the beam}} {{is able to}} be {{minimized}} in other ways. On the ground, physical access is controllable (e.g., via fencing), and typical aircraft <b>flying</b> through the <b>beam</b> provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a Faraday Cage), which will intercept the microwaves. Other aircraft (balloons, ultralight, etc.) can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces, as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace. The microwave beam intensity at ground level {{in the center of}} the beam would be designed and physically built into the system; simply, the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels, even in principle.|$|R

Penguin used this new form to his advantage, giving Langstrom cures in {{exchange}} for the Man-Bat's help with crimes and Langstrom creating robotic animals. Red Robin manages to get Langstrom's mind to surface in Man-Bat, allowing him to help with defeating the Penguin and defending Gotham against the Midas meteor.

30|$|The {{processing}} {{was then}} refined {{to account for}} the actual horizontal offset between UAV and radar by taking time lags due to wind advection into account, assuming frozen advection of the turbulent irregularities by the wind along the wind direction. This often provided higher correlation coefficients between ε_U and the radar-derived ε profiles, especially when the UAV was flying directly upstream of the radar. Yet, because the improvements were quite marginal, the procedure is not described in detail here. Note that time offsets could be avoided by <b>flying</b> in the <b>beam</b> of the radar, but the vehicle produces strong echoes that obliterate the turbulence measurements in the volume of interest, requiring a more complex analysis that considers neighboring times or altitudes (e.g., Scipión et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of our contributions and directions {{of research in the}} domain of optical scanners, with regard to their perspectives of use in optical coherence tomography (OCT). The performances, advantages and drawbacks of the different types of scanning systems are summarized. Both 1 -D and 2 -D scanners for various applications in OCT, from swept source filters to <b>flying</b> the <b>beam</b> over the target are considered. We briefly present our developments of polygon mirror (PM) scanners. We study galvoscanners (GS) in order to increase their duty cycle in general and for high speed scanners in particular. The limitations in reaching such goals are discussed. Based on these advancements, 2 -D scanners, i. e. the double GS and the PM+GS solutions are approached with regard to their optimum driving functions. The 2 -D Risley prism scanner is also considered, as the best choice when compactness is of prime importance. We finally briefly discuss the tendency towards miniaturization and recent developments in MEMS scanners. A trade-off is thus accomplished between recent developments and requirements of scanning devices for OCT in order to achieve the most appropriate results for a certain application. The current and future tendencies in the field are discussed. Â© 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|Position-sensitive Devices (PSDs) {{are often}} used in the {{industrial}} environment, where the system light source used for position measurement is co-existing with many other light sources in the vicinity, along with their reflections and back-scatters from various surfaces. These unavoidable stray beams and illumination noises may fall on the detector surface in different spatial distributions and produce unpredicted variations in their position response. Some of the light sources may even have <b>flying</b> or rotating <b>beams</b> of sufficient energy. In this study, {{attempt was made to}} model and analyze these stray noises with respect to the operation of PSDs. Thus it was investigated how the presence of the spurious sources changes the behaviour of these detectors and how much is the position output modified quantitatively. The experimental results obtained by using PSDs and signal beams along with the spurious sources are presented. The obtained data is compared with the results from the proposed mathematical model to be within fraction of a percent of error...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} and others have {{theoretically}} modeled and comprehensively analyzed the beam-on-beam collision (Yu, et al., Int J Solids Struct 28 (2001) 2001; Ruan et al., Int J Solids Struct 40 (12) (2003) 2937 - 2956; Ruan and Yu, Int J Mech Sci 45 (3) (2003) 397 - 423), as typical examples of collisions between two deformable structures. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the energy partitioning in the two colliding beams {{as well as in the}} local contact deformation. In order to verify these theoretical models, experiments were conducted on the collision between a <b>flying</b> free-free <b>beam</b> and a stationary simply supported beam. The free-free beam was accelerated by a bullet ejected from an air gun. The energy dissipation was calculated based on the residual flexural profiles of the colliding beams. It is found that most of the curvature change concentrated in the middle portions of the two beams, indicating that most of the plastic deformation occurred in their mid-spans. This fact justifies the modal solution. The energy dissipation ratio of the two beams obtained from the experiments shows a good agreement with the theoretical predictions, verifying the theoretical models previously developed. The contact areas were also clearly identified and measured. The comparison with theoretical modal proposed in Ruan and Yu, Int J Mech Sci 45 (3) (2003) 397 - 423 shows that the Blunt Indentation model is the best one while the elastic response is not negligible if the local deformation is concerned.

2500|$|Provided with a {{low power}} {{klystron}} as a microwave source, Lovell and Hodgkin began experimenting with horn antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy than the Yagi antennas used on the Mk. IV. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed {{in the direction of}} observation. This would also have the side-effect of allowing the radar to avoid ground reflections simply by pointing the antenna away from the ground. With a beamwidth of 10 degrees, a horizontal antenna would still create some downward-pointed signal, about 5 degrees in this case. If the aircraft were <b>flying</b> at , the <b>beam</b> would not strike the ground until about [...] in front of the aircraft, leaving some room for detection against even the lowest flying targets. Lovell was able to build horns with the required 10degree accuracy, but they were over [...] long, making them unsuitable for installation in a fighter.|$|R
40|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig. 1, the total proton-antiproton cross section {{is the sum}} of the elastic and inelastic components, {sigma}{sub tot} = {sigma}{sub EL} + {sigma}{sub IN}. The inelastic cross section consists of three terms; single diffraction, double-diffraction, and everything else (referred to as the 'hard core'), {sigma}{sub IN} = {sigma}{sub SD} + {sigma}{sub DD} + {sigma}{sub HC}. For elastic scattering neither of the beam particles breaks apart (i. e. color singlet exchange). For single and double diffraction {{one or both of the}} beam particles are excited into a high mass color singlet state (i. e. N* states) which then decays. Single and double diffraction also corresponds to color singlet exchange between the beam hadrons. When color is exchanged the outgoing remnants are no longer color singlets and one has a separation of color resulting in a multitude of quark-antiquark pairs being pulled out of the vacuum. The 'hard core' component, {sigma}{sub HC}, involves color exchange and the separation of color. However, the 'hard core' contribution has both a 'soft' and 'hard' component. Most of the time the color exchange between partons in the beam hadrons occurs through a soft interaction (i. e. no high transverse momentum) and the two beam hadrons 'ooze' through each other producing lots of soft particles with a uniform distribution in rapidity and many particles <b>flying</b> down the <b>beam</b> pipe. Occasionally there is a hard scattering among the constituent partons producing outgoing particles and 'jets' with high transverse momentum...|$|R
50|$|Berry's first {{work was}} with the Northern Aerial Mineral Exploration Ltd. at Hudson, Ontario, where {{he became the first}} pilot to land at Baker Lake, Northwest Territories. In 1929, he took a course in flight instruction. In 1931, he became the first pilot to fly back and forth between Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories and Edmonton, Alberta in the same day. In 1931, Berry joined Canadian Airways Limited (CAL), though his early history of the company was {{unstable}} due to lay-offs in 1932. Berry briefly joined Mackenzie Air Services, but after being injured in a crash sought further education from a RCAF course at Camp Borden in instrument <b>flying</b> and radio <b>beam</b> work before returning to CAL. During his service to CAL, he piloted several notable rescue flights. In 1935, he found and flew to safety missing CAL pilot Con Farrel and engineer F. Hartley, who had been stranded for eleven days in the Barren Lands after a blizzard downed their aircraft. In 1936, he rescued Flight Lieutenant S. Coleman and Leading Aircraftsman J. Fortey of the RCAF from the Barren Lands north of Great Slave Lake, for which rescue he won the McKee Trophy. Later that same year, he captained a record-breaking mission with engineer Rex Terpening to rescue Bishop Falaise and his party who were stranded by blizzard at the Roman Catholic mission at Hornaday River on the Arctic Ocean. In spite of darkness and storm conditions, Berry and Terpening located the group and made another flight to bring them food. Thereafter, after being grounded for ten days, Berry and Terpening flew the group to safety. No aircraft had ever flown so far north during the winter before.|$|R
40|$|Echolocating insectivorous bats are nocturnal mammals {{that capture}} fast, erratically moving insects in flight. Bats emit short {{ultrasonic}} pulses that form beams {{of sound and}} use the returning echoes to guide behavior. The frequency, duration and timing of the sonar pulses, along with the spatial direction of the sonar beam restrict the information returning to the bat, and {{can be considered a}} component of the acoustic gaze of bats. A great deal is known about the time-frequency structure of bat echolocation calls and their relationship to the stages of foraging flight in bats. It is however not known how bats direct their sonar beam in flight or how beam direction is related to flight control. This is the first study of the sonar beam direction in freely flying bats as they chase and capture insects. An apparatus and method to measure the sonar beam pattern of echolocating bats (Eptesicus fuscus, big brown bats) as they fly in a laboratory flight room is described. It is shown that the bat locks its sonar beam tightly onto a target during pursuit (Chapter 2). The <b>flying</b> bat's sonar <b>beam</b> consists of two lobes directed apart in the vertical plane (Chapter 3). There is a coupling between acoustic gaze (sonar beam axis) direction and flight turn rate that can be expressed as a delayed linear control law. The gain of this law (steepness of the relationship) varies with the bat's behavioral state (Chapter 4). The bat, when pursuing erratically flying insects, adopts a strategy that keeps the absolute direction to the target a constant. This strategy is shown, under some assumptions, to minimize time-to-intercept of erratically maneuvering targets and is similar to parallel navigation implemented in guided missiles (Chapter 5). The bat is not helpless against ultrasound-triggered evasive dives evolved by some hearing insects. The bat adopts flight strategies to counter such dives (Chapter 6). This work allows us to compare spatial behaviors well studied in visual animals, with similar behaviors in an animal that is guided by hearing and make inferences about common computational strategies employed by nervous systems...|$|R
