2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{safe level}} for iodine-131 and caesium-137 {{in drinking water}} in Japan are 100Bq/kg and 200Bq/kg respectively. The Japanese science ministry said on 20 March that radioactive substances were detected in tap water in Tokyo, as well as Tochigi, Gunma, Chiba and Saitama prefectures. IAEA reported on 24 March that drinking water in Tokyo, Fukushima and Ibaraki had been above regulatory limits between 16 and 21 March. On 26 March, IAEA reported that the values were now within legal limits. On 23 March, Tokyo drinking water exceeded the safe level for infants, prompting the government to distribute bottled water to families with infants. Measured levels were caused by iodine-131 (I-131) and were 103, 137 and 174 Bq/l. On 24 March, iodine-131 was detected in 12 of 47 prefectures, of which the level in Tochigi was the highest at 110Bq/kg. Caesium-137 was detected in 6 prefectures but always below 10Bq/kg. On 25 March, tap water {{was reported to have}} reduced to 79Bq/kg and to be safe for infants in Tokyo and Chiba but still <b>exceeded</b> <b>limits</b> in Hitachi and Tokaimura.

On October 28, 2008, Republican Sen.

The company provided the representatives with cars and reimbursed some of their expenses. Nevertheless, WDR believed that since the sales reps also stored gum and personally resupplied retailers, including replacement of stale gum stocks at no cost, the company did more than just solicit customers in Wisconsin.|$|E
