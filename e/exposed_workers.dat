5|$|Laboratory {{facilities}} for medical research were limited, but some {{research was conducted}} into the effects of radiation, and the absorption and toxic effects of metals, particularly plutonium and beryllium, mainly {{as a result of}} accidents. The Health Group began conducting urine tests of laboratory workers in early 1945, and many of these revealed dangerous levels of plutonium. Work on the Water Boiler also occasionally <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> to dangerous fission products. There were 24 fatal accidents at Los Alamos between its opening in 1943 and September 1946. Most involved construction workers. Four scientists died, including Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin in criticality accidents involving the demon core.|$|E

25|$|One {{vermiculite}} mine {{operated by}} W. R. Grace and Company in Libby, Montana <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and community residents to danger by mining vermiculite contaminated with asbestos, typically richterite, winchite, actinolite or tremolite. Vermiculite contaminated with asbestos from the Libby mine {{was used as}} insulation in residential and commercial buildings through Canada and the United States. W. R. Grace and Company's loose-fill vermiculite was marketed as Zonolite but was also used in sprayed-on products such as Monokote.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} average {{perchlorate}} absorption in perchlorate plant workers {{subjected to the}} highest exposure has been estimated as approximately 0.5mg/kg-day, as in the above paragraph, a 67% reduction of iodine uptake would be expected. Studies of chronically <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> though have thus far failed to detect any abnormalities of thyroid function, including the uptake of iodine. This may well be attributable to sufficient daily exposure or intake of healthy iodine-127 among the workers and the short 8-hr biological half life of perchlorate in the body.|$|E

Resultance of some studies found that air quality that we inhale, affect our health quality. The air quality impact to our lungs and whole cardiorespiratory system. To measure O 2 maximum value that conducted to the muscles from lungs we can use VO 2 Max test. Objective: This study aim to know the VO 2 Max value difference between officer and pollutant <b>exposed</b> <b>worker.</b> Methods:Study design using analytic observational with cross sectional approaches. Each group has 25 samples taken using purposive sampling method. Samples are 20 - 59 yesrs old men which fulfil the restriction criteria. The difference of the mean value VO 2 Max was analyzed using t test of two unpaired groups from SPPS 17. 0 for windows. Result: The result shows {{that there was no}} significant difference statistically in the mean value VO 2 max on men between officer (57, 8108 ml/kg weight/min) and pollutant <b>exposed</b> <b>worker</b> (60, 2412 ml/kg weight/min).

25|$|Chronic arsenic {{poisoning}} {{is known}} as arsenicosis. This disorder affects workers in smelters, in populations whose drinking water contains high levels of arsenic (0.3–0.4ppm), and in patients treated for long periods with arsenic-based pharmaceuticals. Similarly, studies on workers exposed in copper foundries in the U.S., Japan and Sweden indicate a risk of lung cancer 6–10 times higher for the most <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> compared with the general population. Long-term ingestion of arsenic trioxide either in drinking water or as a medical treatment can lead to skin cancer. Reproductive problems (high incidences of miscarriage, low birth weight, congenital deformations) have also been indicated in one study of women exposed to arsenic trioxide dust as employees or neighbours of a copper foundry.|$|E

40|$|Individual polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (CB) congeners in adipose and whole blood tissues of a capacitor manufacture worker (occupational/accidental exposure) {{and of the}} general population were determined. Nondestructive sample cleanup and multidimensional gas chromatography-electron capture detection (MDGC-ECD) techniques were applied. Special attention was given to the toxicologically relevant congeners CB- 77, CB- 126, CB- 169, CB- 105, CB- 114, CB- 118, CB- 156, CB- 167, and CB- 189 (IUPAC). Lipid-based tissue contents of sigma CBs were higher in the occupationally/accidentally <b>exposed</b> <b>worker</b> (adipose = 7, 000 ng/g; whole blood = 11 ng/g) than in the general population (adipose = 300 ng/g; whole blood = 1. 9 ng/g). Among the non-ortho Cl CBs, CB- 77 was below detection limit (< 1. 0 pg/g). The contents of CB- 126 for the capacitor manufacture worker were 2, 000 and 3 pg/g, and in the general population were 100 and 2 pg/g for adipose and whole blood, respectively. The corresponding data for CB- 169 were 3, 500 and 4 for adipose and whole blood, respectively, in the <b>exposed</b> <b>worker,</b> and 40 and 2 for adipose and whole blood, respectively, in the general population. Congeners with highest contents were CB- 153, CB- 138, CB- 180, CB- 170, and CB- 187. These congeners possess chlorine substitution patterns, making them resistant to metabolism. X/ 153 ratios suggest that both PB and 3 -MC type cytochrome P- 450 enzymes were induced in the <b>exposed</b> <b>worker,</b> {{as well as in the}} general population...|$|R
