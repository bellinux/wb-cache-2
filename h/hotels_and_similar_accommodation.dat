30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the implications for the future of cities, it is important to also look at the development of city trips from a city’s perspective. Using Barcelona and Berlin as examples, the enormous growth some cities have experienced in terms of tourist arrivals since 1990 can be illustrated. Arrivals in <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>accommodation</b> establishments in the city area of Barcelona have grown from 1.7 million in 1990 to 7.5 million in 2013. In the city area of Berlin, arrivals in all paid forms of accommodation establishments have increased from 2.8 million in 1990 to 11.3 million in 2013 [32]. What implications this growth already has on cities today, and what they might be in the future, will be discussed in more detail later. In the following section, some {{of the reasons for the}} popularity of city tourism will be explored.|$|E

AIM. A study was undertaken to determine the utility of the delusions-symptoms-states inventory in a sample of homeless men, and the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in this group. METHOD. The inventory was administered to 55 homeless men in a reception centre in Sheffield. RESULTS. Nearly half of the men obtained scores on the inventory suggesting that they had psychiatric symptoms. There was an overlap of syndromes, particularly among those with severe psychiatric illness. For example, seven men had all four classes of psychiatric illness. CONCLUSION. Use of the questionnaire proved satisfactory.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is on tourism culture as it {{operates}} where commercial hospitality is on offer, especially at <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> resorts in developing countries.

In themselves, such perspectives are not new, but they rarely {{seem to have been}} applied in the context of <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> resorts. The first perspective, derived from the work of Homi Bhabha, conceives of tourism culture as hybrid in nature, operating in a ‘third space’ between tourist and ‘host,’ and directs attention to the uncertain and negotiated aspects of tourism culture. In the second, that of the socio-technical system, tourism culture is seen as an interface between, on the one hand, the formal operational rules and procedures designed to deliver an organisation’s mission and, on the other hand, the on-going and lived-in cultures brought into the ‘system’ by tourists and the hospitality providers. The third perspective, that of the total institution, derived from Goffman, focuses to the social and physical boundaries that separate the hotel or resort from the outside world and on the cultural practices that serve to further differentiate it and its population from the outside. It is suggested that use of these perspectives can further our {{understanding of the nature of}} tourism at different destinations <b>and</b> the ways <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> institutions impact on both staff members and holidaymakers.

40|$|Historically, atria were {{protected}} interior patios; well perceived for their climate tempering and spatial amenity to the building; matching a peaceful private outdoor with the yearly climate cycles. Public buildings adopted this in larger scale, {{and with the}} ending 18 th century, atria and arcades merged to a period of architectural highlights of glass covered interiors in steel <b>and</b> glass. Passages, <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> public buildings of an emerging industrial society in Europe and Northern States spurred {{the evolution of the}} "Great Indoors" as an urban feature. The ecology of these indoors were consciously achieved by passive means of temperature control. With the rise of mechanical conditioning and excessive use of glass at facades by the beginning of this century, atria and arcades disappeared more or less from the architectural vocabulary. The late 1950 s though experienced a revival of atria as a commercial amenity in malls, <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> type of public places. These atria, however, were generally mechanical conditioned; just typically being enormous energy wasters. With the growing urge for energy conservation today, new parameters form our buildings. For this, atria and arcades of urban scale and passive control achieve a new validity as energy conscious urban form. As the key to our energy future in buildings lies well in the urban context, whose inventory per se offers already a fair degree of energy efficiency, improvements there would yield greatest rewards compared to current suburban solar sprawl. The re-interpretation of atria and arcades will provide a perfect planning tool for this urban energy conservation. The glass covered indoors will match with urban scale and site restraints and spur urban life for livable norther winter cities. Exploring atria and arcades as climate buffers and interior amenity for snow belt latitudes, this thesis presents an architectural review, and concludes with design patterns for habitable and energy conscious urban indoors. by Joachim W.

40|$|All {{efforts to}} be made as to analyze the tourism {{activity}} on the Black Sea countries are justified by the tremendous potential due to the natural and cultural resources that are largely miscellaneous and of high quality. Those features turn the Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Georgia and Turkey into attractive destinations for tourists. The main problem that occurs refers {{to the fact that}} the existence of some resources is not reason enough to make tourists choose such destinations. The system of the tourism statistic indicators has the purpose to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively, the process of the tourist activity and the causal relation between the factors that influence it. One of the main functions of the tourism indicators system is the characterization of the economic relation of Black Sea countries with other countries, of the efficiency of the cooperation relations in the frame of the international tourism relations. An attempt to draw up a coherent effective strategy for developing the regional tourism in the region of Black Sea in accordance with the market economy must begin with a realistic evaluation and analysis of the actual state of the tourism in the region and must have a starting point in a comparative analysis with the neighbourhood, from central and eastern Europe. A model of bifactorial variance analysis with regard to the issue of international tourism development in these countries is important for the economic and social policy, by sustaining the hypotheses about the existence of differences in average number of nights spent by foreign tourists in <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> establishments between countries. This study aims at performing such evaluation using the data offered by the CESTAT Statistical Bulletin and the indicator selection and interpretation have taken into account the facilities of the actual information system. Thus, for such an analysis, data are depicted in a bidimensional matrix with r x s size and with xij elements which describe the average number of nights spend by foreign tourists in <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> establishments, when one factor is on level i, i= (countries) and another on level j, j= (years). On the one hand, we analyze whether the differences recorded over the mentioned countries in the average number of night spend in hotels have statistic significance or not. In the other hand, we study whether the differences recorded over the years have statistic significance. A research into this issue can use the absolute total number of overnight stays of foreign tourists, but in order to ensure comparability of data and because there are differences between countries in number of bed-places, we proceed to turn absolute total figures in average figures. After computation for four years (1997 - 2000), for the countries: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Republic of Slovenia and Slovak Republic and for a type I error probability a= 0. 05, we find the values for Fisher-Snedecor test for statistic significance of the differences between countries: Fr- 1;(r- 1) (s- 1) =F 5; 15 = 71. 776 >Ftab 0. 05; 5; 15 = 4. 62 and between years: Fs- 1;(r- 11) (s- 1) =F 3; 15 = 0. 02 <Ftab 0. 05; 3; 15 = 8. 70 So, the result confirm the hypotheses of significant differences (p< 0. 05) between counties in central and eastern Europe in average number of nights spend by foreign tourists in hotels. In a Post-hoc comparison of means with Scheffe test we found that there are significant differences between Poland and Romania (on the one hand) and almost all the other countries, in the other hand: in Poland and Romania, the average number of nights spend in hotels by foreign tourists is smaller...|$|R

The Article begins in Part II by discussing the largely unexamined parallel between intellectual property law’s treatment of expression-based defenses <b>and</b> the <b>similar</b> <b>accommodations</b> that will need to be incorporated into data privacy law. Part II also addresses potential objections to modeling privacy law on intellectual property. Although there are some important conceptual differences between intellectual property and privacy protections, these differences are outweighed by their similarities, at least {{when it comes to the}} specific issue of how to harmonize such protections with expressive freedoms. Parts III through V delineate the doctrinal mechanisms judges have built into copyright, trademark, and publicity rights law for balancing the interests of intellectual property owners with free-speech concerns. Part III describes how intellectual property law deems particular categories of plaintiff communication to be worthy of protection and unworthy of First Amendment privileges for unauthorized users. Part IV notes how intellectual property law uses speaker intent as a proxy for First Amendment interests. Part V details specific doctrinal mechanisms used to evaluate the expressive importance of an intellectual property defendant’s speech contribution. Parts III through V also describe how courts could use these mechanisms to evaluate the constitutionality of new data privacy laws. By borrowing from intellectual property, courts can respond to the current public demand for restrictions on data use while still protecting the key expressive interests at the heart of the First Amendment...|$|R
