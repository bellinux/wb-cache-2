The single's commercial success funded Aguilera's debut album from RCA, in addition to gaining <b>her</b> <b>credibility</b> amongst established writers and producers. Releases of the single were limited, which resulted in the track charting only on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, at number nineteen. An accompanying music video for the song was included on the DVD release of Mulan. Aguilera has performed the track on four televised performances, including at the CBS This Morning show, which saw her gain the attention of songwriter Diane Warren.|$|E

However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, <b>her</b> <b>credibility</b> as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what she is saying, with no memory of it afterward.

[...] Similar to the real-life model, Martha Logan becomes contemptuous of her husband's conduct in office and decides to go public and end his career. [...] Martha Logan takes part in a plot to get her husband to confess that he conspired with terrorists.

500|$|In 2015, Kapoor starred as {{a runaway}} bride in Dolly Ki Doli, a comedy co-starring Pulkit Samrat, Rajkummar Rao and Varun Sharma. Mints Udita Jhunjhunwala criticised Kapoor's {{performance}} in the film, writing that her [...] "range is too limited to bring alive a character that may have had heaps of potential on paper". Shubhra Gupta wrote: [...] "Kapoor is in almost every frame, and should have filled them all. But {{the treatment of the}} character shows up her limitations." [...] Despite the negative reviews for her performance, she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. While filming SoorajR. Barjatya's Prem Ratan Dhan Payo with Salman Khan in Gondal, Gujarat in February 2015, Kapoor was diagnosed with swine influenza, from which she recovered the following month. Kapoor portrayed Rajkumari Maithili Devi, a princess looking for love. The film became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. She was praised by Rachit Gupta for <b>her</b> <b>credibility</b> as a royal, and Komal Nahta thought that the role was significant enough to be a turning point in her career. However, she won a Golden Kela Award for Worst Actress.|$|E

500|$|Twenty-six people, mainly police officers, {{were interviewed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the {{subsequent}} PIC inquiry. Several witnesses from the party, as well as Webster, Wilson and NC1 were also questioned. The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews: Webster, Wilson, NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as NC5, a relative of Webster who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder. Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so, Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder. According to Scott Tucker writing in The Newcastle Herald, police were also accused of threatening violence, falsifying reports and withholding evidence; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs, who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing. Carrington was also summoned to give evidence, though she was not informed why; her book, Who Killed Leigh Leigh, which criticised police over their handling of the investigation, had been released earlier that year. Carrington was cross-examined for three days, longer than any of the police officers who were questioned, in what was described by Hillary Byrne-Armstrong as [...] "an inquisition on just about every word she had spoken [...] written" [...] in relation to Leigh's murder". Byrne-Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking <b>her</b> <b>credibility</b> on issues they had no intention of investigating, and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police.|$|E
500|$|On August 10, 2013, two {{snippets of}} the song leaked online. Gaga urged fans to [...] "please take these down as much as possible" [...] and {{provided}} {{instructions on how to}} report information regarding the unauthorized distribution of her song to her label's parent company, Universal Music Group. In response, fans reported websites seen distributing or linking to the snippets of the single, with nearly 2,500 individuals sending a singular link to Universal's takedown page. However, despite such efforts, a leak was eminent. So Gaga released the song a week early onto various radio stations across America. The single was made available in most countries just before midnight (EST) on the iTunes Store, coupled with a pre-order of Artpop. Following day, Gaga was seen in goth costume with clown-like face paint similar to the [...] "Applause" [...] artwork, at various promotional events. The Huffington Post compared the style-shift to Marilyn Manson, saying: [...] "With her black hair slicked back, a face full of white powder and her black blazer and shirt combo, Gaga could have easily been mistaken for Manson if it wasn't for her towering heels." [...] Gaga also premiered a short clip of [...] "Applause" [...] that quoted harsh journalism that attacked <b>her</b> <b>credibility</b> as an artist. In the video, Gaga was seen sitting naked in a white room and wearing a transparent visor. The sound of an audience booing and jeering was heard in the background. Direct quotations from critics and detractors appeared {{at the bottom of the}} video, which included: [...] "Lady Gaga is over"and [...] "Do not buy Lady Gaga's new single 'Applause'". The clip was construed as an attempt at reverse psychology.|$|E
2500|$|Lovelace's accusations {{provoked}} mixed responses. Skeptics included Traynor, {{who admitted}} to striking Lovelace {{but said it}} was part of a voluntary sex game. In Legs McNeil's and Jennifer Osborne's 2005 book The Other Hollywood, several witnesses, including Deep Throat director Gerard Damiano, state that Traynor beat Boreman behind closed doors, but they also question <b>her</b> <b>credibility.</b> Eric Edwards, Boreman's co-star in the dog sex films and other loops that featured Linda urinating on her sex partners, similarly discounts <b>her</b> <b>credibility.</b> According to Edwards, Boreman was a sexual [...] "super freak" [...] who had no boundaries and was a pathological liar. Adult-film actress Gloria Leonard was quoted as saying, [...] "This was a woman who never took responsibility for her own [...] choices made; but instead blamed everything that happened to her in her life on porn." [...] Corroboration for Lovelace's claim came from Andrea True, Lovelace's co-star in Deep Throat 2, who, on a commentary DVD track of the documentary Inside Deep Throat, stated that Traynor was a sadist and was disliked by the Deep Throat 2 cast. Andrea Dworkin stated that the results of polygraph tests administered to Boreman support her assertions. Moreover, psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman notes that many details in Lovelace's memoir Ordeal are consistent with a diagnosis of Complex PTSD, such as Lovelace's description of a fragmented personality in the aftermath of alleged abuse. Because of the circumstances of her upbringing, however, it had ceased to be clear whether the abuse came from Traynor or from Boreman's parents.|$|E
50|$|Discontent with Thatcher's {{leadership}} of the party had been growing over the latter years of her tenure. In December 1989, she had been challenged for the leadership {{for the first time}} since her election in 1975, by the little known 69-year-old backbencher MP Sir Anthony Meyer. Thatcher faced no serious threat of losing to this stalking horse challenger, but <b>her</b> political <b>credibility</b> was undermined by the fact that 60 members of the parliamentary Conservative party had not supported her, 33 voting for Meyer, 24 spoiling their ballot papers, and three not voting at all.|$|R

Sciarretto also characterized the song as [...] "darkly romantic" [...] and [...] "sort of epic." ...|$|R

[...] Two years later, she had two other UK hits on her own with [...] "Nothing Has Been Proved" [...] and [...] "In Private."

This motivation may have influenced her racial analysis by playing to the popular prejudices of her white audiences. On the other hand, she may have deliberately tried to distance herself from those prejudices, especially the ones propagated by the more vulgar and hysterical Asian exclusionists in British Columbia in order to maximize <b>her</b> own <b>credibility</b> and sway <b>her</b> more moderate readers.|$|R
2500|$|By 1967 Shaw's {{record sales}} were declining and her manager decided on {{more of a}} cabaret appeal.

Although she disliked the song {{and thought it was}} unrepresentative of her material, the song won the contest by a near-record margin of votes, and made Shaw the first person to win the contest for the UK.

In answer to prosecutor's questions she stated that [...] the documents in her bag on terror plans and weapons had been given to her, and that she did not know that the boy who was with her in Ghazni was her son. When it was pointed out that the document in her bag were in her own handwriting, she stated [...] "in a vague and halting manner" [...] that she had been forced to copy them out of a magazine so that her children would not be tortured.

2500|$|Makin’s {{introductory}} {{address to}} her audience {{is followed by}} two letters in which she takes on a male persona. While her first male persona is pro-learning, the following letter's masculine voice sets up Makin's argument as he, an objector to women's learning, claims that [...] "Women do not much desire Knowledge; they are of low parts, soft fickle natures [...] [...] [...] [...] they will abuse their Education" [...] (Makin 1673). Such objections to female erudition are taken up and refuted throughout the essay. Makin's strongest argument comes in the following long section of the essay in which she catalogues mythological, legendary, biblical, historical and contemporary women, women who were writers, artists, moral heroines and mothers (Myers 1985:181). In her listing of female worthies Makin establishes <b>her</b> <b>credibility,</b> her ethos, her right and ability to promote education for women, but more importantly, she, in turning to external proofs, reveals how [...] "Women were formerly Educated in the knowledge of Arts and Tongues, and by their Education, many did rise to a great height in Learning" [...] (Makin 1673). Makin goes on to claim that, [...] "Were Women thus Educated now I am confident the advantage would be very great" [...] (Makin 1673).|$|E
