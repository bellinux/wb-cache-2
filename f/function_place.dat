Methods and results Transthoracic and transoesophageal data from patients with a variety of cardiac conditions were used for analysis of LV regional function. The focus was on the effects of mechanical asynchrony. Ejection fraction was calculated on the basis of LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume obtained by two different ways: (i) end-systolic volume as a whole; and (ii) the sum of all regional end-systolic volumes (which may occur at different times). The relative difference, D-EF, between EFs obtained by (i) and (ii) was taken as the ‘merit ’ of EF. A value of zero is the highest merit. Irrespective of the examination method, we found that D-EF was always higher than zero, and that its value depended on the extent of mechanical asynchrony. Conclusions Ejection fraction is not the arithmetic average of regional EFs. An increase of asynchrony increases D-EF, i. e. it reduces the merit of EF as a measure of cardiac function...|$|E

40|$|We have {{compared}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae global gene expression in wild-type and mutants (ÃŽÂ”hap 2 and ÃŽÂ”hap 4) of the HAP transcriptional complex, {{which has been}} shown to be necessary for growth on respiratory substrates. Several hundred ORFs are under positive or negative control of this complex and we analyse here in detail the effect of HAP on mitochondria. We found that most of the genes upregulated in the wild-type strain were involved in organelle functions, but practically none of the downregulated ones. Nuclear genes encoding the different subunits of the respiratory chain complexes figure in the genes more expressed in the wild-type than in the mutants, as expected, but in this group we also found key components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus. This control of mitochondrial translation may be one of the means of coordinating mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression in elaborating the respiratory chain. In addition, HAP controls the nuclear genes involved in several other mitochondrial processes (import, mitochondrial division) that define the metabolic state of the cell, but not mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription. In most cases, a putative CCAAT-binding site is present upstream of the ORF, while in others no such sites are present, suggesting the control to be indirect. The large number of genes regulated by the HAP complex, as well as the fact that HAP also regulates some putative transcriptional activators of unknown <b>function,</b> <b>place</b> this complex at a hierarchically high position in the global transcriptional regulation of the cell...|$|E

Myelinating glial cells {{are thought to}} associate with neuronal axons, in part, via the cell-surface adhesion protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). MAG is also {{thought to be a}} major inhibitor of neurite outgrowth (axon regeneration) in the adult central nervous system. Primary structure and in vitro <b>function</b> <b>place</b> MAG in an immunoglobulin-related family of sialic acid-binding lactins. We report that a limited set of structurally related gangliosides, known to be expressed on myelinated neurons in vivo, are ligands for MAG. When major brain gangliosides were adsorbed as artificial membranes on plastic microwells, only GT 1 b and GD 1 a supported cell adhesion of MAG-transfected COS- 1 cells. Furthermore, a quantitatively minor ganglioside expressed on cholinergic neurons, GQ 1 b alpha (also known as Chol- 1 alpha-b), was much more potent than GT 1 b or GD 1 a in supporting MAG-mediated cell adhesion. Adhesion to either GT 1 b or GQ 1 b alpha was abolished by pretreatment of the adsorbed gangliosides with neuraminidase. On the basis of structure-function studies of 19 test glycosphingolipids, an alpha 2, 3 -N-acetylneuraminic acid residue on the terminal galactose of a gangliotetraose core is necessary for MAG binding, and additional sialic acid residues linked to the other neutral core saccharides [Gal(II) and GalNAc(III) ] contribute significantly to binding affinity. MAG-mediated adhesion to gangliosides was blocked by pretreatment of the MAG-transfected COS- 1 cells with anti-MAG monoclonal antibody 513, which is known to inhibit oligodendrocyte-neuron binding. These data are consistent with the conclusion that MAG-mediated cell-cell interactions involve MAG-ganglioside recognition and binding...|$|E

40|$|THE POSTPOSITIONAL LOCATIVES IN THE TRANSLATION OF THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE BY J. BRETKŪNAS Summary The article {{deals with}} a {{syntactic}} and semantic system of 4 Old Lithuanian locatives (PLs) in J. Bretkūnas' Gospel according to Luke. A particular feature of Luke {{is that it was}} translated from Latin, {{while the rest of the}} NT was translated from different German editions of M. Luther's Bible. There have been some attempts to identify the edition of the Vulgate which J. Bretkūnas chose for the translation of Luke, but this problem is not entirely solved. A more detailed analysis and comparison of Luke with some 16 th c. editions of the NT allowed me to draw a preliminary conclusion that J. Bretkūnas used (beside the Versio Erasmi) the Editio Wittembergae of 1529. In all likelihood he also used the Editio Cōplutensae (the Complutensian Polyglot Bible) of 1521. In the 16 th c. Lithuanian the postpositional case forms were used in certain meanings in the contexts where prepositional phrases (PPs) predominate nowadays. 26, 2 % of Latin PPs correspond to the Iness., Ill., Adess. or All. The PLs are distinct in their syntactic and semantic functions while case syncretism in Latin has caused more explicit express of overlapped semantic value of some cases in a sentence. In order to establish semantic boundaries of the PLs it was reasonable to specify the functions of spatio-temporal location or direction more precisely. Thus the following semantic functions are distinguished: 1) place within (it also includes the aspects of a) inner state, and b) process(es) in mind), 2) place at/near, 3) place/spread within/ among, 4) movement into, 5) movement toward (which figuratively is related with the function of), 6) ad­dressee, and 7) determined interval of time. In many cases the PPs stimulated usage of the autochtonous Lithuanian means. Although there are instances of an obvious interference of Latin with the continuation of such patterns observed in Modern Lithuanian. A puzzling case appears at a semantic level – the Adess. does not happen to bear its main <b>function</b> (<b>place</b> at/near), more often it denotes process(es) in mind. </p...|$|E

Objective: This research {{intends to}} identify the risk factors associated to the permanence of venous vascular accesses in the newly born that have entered the service of Neonatology {{in the city of}} Cuenca Material and Methods: It is a descriptive study that allowed us to determine the criteria for the placement and removal of the venous vascular accesses according to their <b>function,</b> <b>place</b> of collocation, and type of access. The universe was constituted by 700 newly born who were registered in neonatology in the year 2012. The sample framework corresponds to 79 newly born who were introduced venous vascular accesses in the months of March, April, and May of the year 2013. The techniques used were the interview and direct and indirect observation, and the instrument utilized was a previously made form which was applied by the author. The computer programs, SPSS, version 21, Excel, and Word were used for the data analysis and the presentation of results. The results are shown in 2 x 2 tables. Results: The risk factors associated to the permanence of the venous vascular accesses are the following. The 81 % of newly born entered the area before their 24 hours of life. The 32 % of newly born showed retardation in intrauterine growth. One hundred venous vascular accesses were installed, of which, 74 % were peripheral, 12 % were percutaneous, 5 % were central, and 9 % umbilical. 63 % venous vascular accesses were introduced in premature newly born with low weight (< 2500 gr.). The most frequently place of insertion was the cephalic vein of the arm with the 23 %. The removal responded to the following; the 26 % to the end of treatment and the 17 % to edema in the place of insertion. Conclusion: From this research, it is concluded that the nursing personnel do not adequately perform the insertion and maintenance techniques of the venous vascular accesses nor the disinfection or sterilization, especially in the peripheral venous accesses, for which reason, complications were observed.

40|$|Placemaking as a {{structural}} {{tool for the}} collective end-user to customize the streets; research on the space and guidelines for the Bergweg, Rotterdam Citizen participation {{has been an important}} topic within the built environment for quite some time now. In the Netherlands this practice started as panel groups that provided input for the designers of neighbourhoods, and has developed into a mandatory part of public project development. Cooperating with the end user from early on creates a smooth process and decreases the amount of annoyance experienced by the end users. The Dutch government is shifting from a social state into a participation society, therefore the citizen gets a more and more central role in urban renewal. “Individuals and groups, inhabitant and entrepreneurs build, reuse and reorganize dwellings, workplaces, parks and streets or even entire neighborhoods and business parks. ” (Ruijs, 2012) At the same time the funds for urban renewal are slowly runnig empty, while the citizen participation model in its current state is very cost intensive and very focussed on a custom approach. To be able to enable the end user as a sustainable partner in the proces of revitalizing the Bergweg, the placemaking process according to Project for Public Spaces is used as a generic tool to be able to design for flexibility. Enabling the end users means providing them with space that has very little restrictions for use, and clear guidelines. This, with constructive facilitation can offer a revitalization proces where the end user plays {{a central role in the}} final result. Placemaking Archetypes Placemaking is the transformation of a space into a place. This is a proces that is influenced by the existing built environment, the present end users and the time frame we live in. Within these variables, 4 factors make up the archetypes of places. 1. Placemaker It can be an individual, a group of entrepreneurs, or a owners association. The placemaker is someone who is putting in time and effort for a place, varying from the initiative to maintenance. 2. Lifecycle place How frequent and how long a space is transformed into a place has direct effect on the social-spacial structure, and could also have influence on the fysical-spacial structure. 3. Type / <b>Function</b> <b>place</b> The functions that are added in the public realm consist out of (a combination of) 5 activities De func die worden toegevoegd in de openbare ruimte bestaat uit (een combinatie van) 5 zaken: greenify sitting / cover playing / sport eat / drink expose / art 4. Ownership / Accessibility Place The relationship between a place and public space, considering the accessibiltity and ownership, is an important factor in who is (or can be) involved. This, with the scale and size influence the right for a place to exist. This varies from completely open, to open for contribution or consumption, or completely closed Space When designing space for placemaking, it is important to maintain the road-like functions of a street. This means using the right dimensions for pedestrians, cyclists, cars and in the case of the Bergweg, trams. Traffic safety is one side of the coin. the other is maintaining accessibility for emergency services. Unremovable obstacles should be placed carefully, also considering eventual maintenance for the underground infrastructure. Designing the street in a matter that shows the difference between space ment for placemaking and space that functions as a road is advised. This can be done with difference in material, height, colour and structure. Keeping it simple leaves a larger readibility of the difference between road and space. Guidelines Giving the end user guidelines considering the freedom they have, and the responsibilties this comes with. The placemaking archetypes give the end user a spectrum to choose within. Not obstructing the road function or creating traffic danger is paramount. The more permanent / irremovable a place is (breaking ground), the more it needs to be guided. This means that the placemaker needs to identify him/herself and agree upon taking responsibilty for clean and safe maintenance. Also, in the case of moving out, the transfer or reconstruction of the original situation is a responsibilty of the placemaker. Controlling that the end user does not use the provided space for storage, or unsafe playing, is the responsibility of the local organisation. Method Developing a long term corridor vision for the street is important, a vision that includes the wishes of entrepreneurs and residents. This way property owners can do their part in steering towards the revitalization. Creating a balance between the street as infrastructure, a road, and the street as a destination, for living and shopping, is the core of the vision of the revitalization. Transparancy in the plinth, diversity and extravertedness are recommended for the Bergweg, which has many pre- WWII buildings that provide plenty of identity. Maintaining and re-using the available history is a strengt that creates a differentiating street. Besides offering space and guidelines, it’s important to guide the proces of revitalization. Finding the right matches and entrepreneurs is one side, the other side is letting people do their thing. Providing a digital platform on which the end user can register the place that they make creates a medium that is 24 / 7 reachable, provides communication and can be used to monitor the street. Forming an organization that is hybride between a Building Improvement District and a owners association is reccommended. This organization can gather the funds, vision and negotiate with the municipality. Furthermore this organisation will be managing the placemaking and the digital platform. This re-assures the end user that they keep control and flexibilty, while the municipality has 1 partner to deal with. Conclusion Providing space and guidelines and using a constructive and modern method can give the end user a central role in urban renewal. It is important that urban professionals guide the vision forming and design process so that a long term impact becomes realistic. Implementing this in a context where the end user has already started making claims can increase the chance of success. Furthermore, changing the current citizen participation model from custom demand into citizen impact, freedom with responsibilities is a shift our government has to make.
