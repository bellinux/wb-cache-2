50|$|The female <b>widow</b> <b>bird</b> {{chooses to}} mate with the most {{attractive}} long-tailed male so that her progeny, if male, will themselves be attractive to females {{of the next generation}} - thereby fathering many offspring that carry the female's genes. Since the rate of change in preference is proportional to the average taste amongst females, and as females desire to secure the services of the most sexually attractive males, an additive effect is created that, if unchecked, can yield exponential increases in a given taste and in the corresponding desired sexual attribute.|$|R
