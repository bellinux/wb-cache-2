500|$|Cyrus first {{performed}} [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] live on May 18, 2010 on Dancing With the Stars. Donning {{the black}} leotard and accessories {{used in the}} music video, Cyrus appeared in a human-sized cage and then performed throughout the stage with many costumed backup dancers; Cyrus' dancing was minimal. Her first performance of the song outside the United States was at the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Portugal on May 29, 2010. Cyrus appeared on June 1, 2010 at the Paris, France nightclub 1515 Club and on June 3, 2010 on Britain's Got Talents semifinals to perform [...] "Can't Be Tamed". On the latter, Cyrus wore hot pants, fishnets and boots as she performed. Midway through the performance, Cyrus grabbed a female backup dancer, dipping her low, and simulated a kiss. The performance was met with negative reactions from the media and caused her to release a statement in which Cyrus promised she did not kiss the backup dancer.

500|$|On {{the second}} day of filming the documentary, Lohan posted a message on her Twitter account stating: [...] "Over 40 {{children}} saved so far... Within one day's work". Indian non-governmental organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, said she had not been part of the raid mentioned and threatened legal action over the post. BBC said Lohan was [...] "misinterpreted" [...] and that [...] "she was merely referring to a raid that happened connected to child trafficking". A few days later Lohan posted again on Twitter praising the work of Bachpan Bachao Andolan. She was originally scheduled to be present for the raid, but due to rescheduling arrived in the country too late. Lohan had also been scheduled to interview a representative for UNICEF for the documentary, but failed to show up. The BBC failed to ensure that Lohan had a proper work visa, which might lead to her being added to an immigration blacklist in India. Of her experience working on the film, Lohan said: [...] "he strength of the young boys and girls I met has been truly humbling" [...] and [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> presence in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film".|$|E

It was filmed during {{a week in}} India in December 2009, and transmitted on BBC Three in April 2010. The BBC was criticized for having hired Lohan, and while reviewers called the documentary compelling, they also found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting. Lohan said: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> presence in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film." [...] In April 2010, Lohan was let go from the film The Other Side {{where she had been}} set to star, with the director saying she was [...] "not bankable." [...] In May 2010, Lohan traveled to the Cannes Film Festival to promote the biographical drama Inferno. She was set to star as the lead, adult-film performer Linda Lovelace, but was later replaced while in court mandated rehab. Because she was in Cannes, Lohan missed a mandatory DUI progress hearing. A bench warrant was issued for her arrest which was rescinded after she posted bail. A judge determined that Lohan had violated the terms of her probation by missing several mandatory classes and meetings. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail, followed by 90 days of inpatient rehab treatment. However, Lohan served only 14 days of the jail sentence, due to overcrowding. She then entered an inpatient rehabilitation facility, from where she was released after only 23 days.|$|E

During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli.

2500|$|Commenting on {{this first}} edition of The United Irishman, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, {{maintained}} that the paper pursued [...] "the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty's subjects in Ireland... it is language used in no common way, {{and for this reason}} I have called the attention of her Majesty's Government to it. This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper—it is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being {{to do everything possible to}} drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. I <b>hope,</b> <b>my</b> Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|E
