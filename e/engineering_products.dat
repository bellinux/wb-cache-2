5|$|In 2015–2016, {{percentage}} {{share of}} Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (base year 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery – 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are <b>engineering</b> <b>products,</b> electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers.

40|$|Enterprise-level {{business}} decisions are linked with <b>engineering</b> <b>product</b> decisions by integrating enterprise utility optimization and engineering design optimization under a hierarchical, multilevel, decision-based design framework. The enterprise problem sets attribute targets, that is, specifications, for <b>engineering</b> <b>product</b> development, which then optimizes product performance within the feasible design space {{to match the}} targets with minimum deviations. When the feasible domain imposed by <b>engineering</b> <b>product</b> development is disconnected {{in the space of}} attribute targets, an engineering design with the minimum deviation from the targets may not correspond to the design with the maximum utility value, even though the design is a converged solution from the multilevel optimization. To address this issue, a new algorithm is developed, which systematically explores the target space to lead the <b>engineering</b> <b>product</b> development to a feasible and optimal design in the enterprise context. Analytical examples and an automotive suspension design case study are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. I...|$|R

40|$|Conceptual {{design is}} a {{critical}} and innovative stage in <b>engineering</b> <b>product</b> and system design. In the conceptual design process, it would be ideal if all functional requirements are maintained independently {{according to the law}} of Axiomatic Design theory. However, in practice, especially in complex <b>engineering</b> <b>product</b> and system design, more often the requirements are not independent (or coupled), and this makes conceptual design more difficult. In this paper, a coupling analysis methodology, framework and related techniques are proposed which integrate axiomatic design with the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), in order to identify and analyse the coupling problems existing in conceptual design. An illustrative example is also presented. Organised by: Cranfield UniversityMori Seiki – The Machine Tool Compan...|$|R
