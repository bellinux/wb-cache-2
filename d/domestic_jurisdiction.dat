This was most clearly illustrated when India, in 1946, made a formal complaint in the UN concerning the legalised racial discrimination against Indians in South Africa. Appearing personally before the United Nations General Assembly, Smuts defended the policies of his government by fervently pleading that India's complaint was a matter of <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> However, the General Assembly censured South Africa for its racial policies and called upon the Smuts government to bring its treatment of the South African Indians in conformity with the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} national courts {{in light of the}} expected division of labour between international and <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> in seeking accountability whenever international crimes are committed. The thesis proceeds from the normative assumption that states have a residual obligation to continue investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of international crimes, even after the ICC has intervened. The ICC can only proceed with a handful of investigations and prosecutions in each situation, leaving the bulk of the perpetrators to be prosecuted at the domestic level. Similarly, the ICC can only offer redress to a few victims, leaving the rest to look up to the national system for redress. Based on this, the thesis examines the domestic systems of three ICC- situation countries in order to assess the response at the domestic level in terms of securing domestic accountability and offering redress to victims of international crimes. The thesis assesses {{the extent to which the}} selected countries, being Kenya, Uganda and Côte D’Ivoire carried their share of the burden in investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of international crimes in their <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> upon the ICC’s intervention. The thesis also inquiries into whether the three countries met their obligations towards victims of international crimes...|$|R

This makes, familiarity with the applicable law and practice imperative for both international organizations and those who engage in legal relations with them. Furthermore, the issue of whether, how, {{and to what extent}} domestic courts take into account decisions of foreign and international courts and tribunals in their own decision-making has become increasingly important in recent years. This book provides a comprehensive empirical study of this transnational judicial dialogue, focusing on the law and practice of <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> concerning the legal personality, privileges, and immunities of international organizations. It presents a selection of detailed country-by-country studies, examining the manner of judicial dialogue across <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> and between national and international courts. The approach taken in this book intersects with three highly topical areas of international legal scholarship: the rapidly evolving law of international institutions; the burgeoning research into the role of domestic courts in the international legal system; and the recent rise of empirically-oriented legal scholarship. Utilizing OUP's International Law in Domestic Courts database, the book presents analysis of little-known cases which have real international significance, illustrating the impact and extent of transnational judicial dialogue in the international legal system. The book provides important perspectives on the evolution and status of the law of immunity of international organizations, and contributes to the understanding of relationships between national courts, and between national and international courts...|$|R

40|$|The need {{to create}} an {{international}} court to combat human trafficking is compelling. <b>Domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> vary {{in their power to}} prevent human trafficking. This variance allows human traffickers to take advantage of weak states lacking in enforcement and conviction capabilities. These frail <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> often have porous borders. Efforts and proposals to strengthen domestic systems with a special regard for human trafficking (notably in Central and Eastern Europe) have failed. 11 Section II will set forth the consensus as to the definition of human trafficking and a general background of the regional developments and laws of human trafficking. For purposes of this paper, a special focus will be on the sex trade and sexual exploitation of trafficked women and children. Current legal and treaty regimes that concentrate on human trafficking and why such regimes should first develop regionally, by including only a number of neighboring states, will be the focus of Sections III and IV. By breaking a global problem down and putting pressure on a few arenas at a time, a regional court could {{set the stage for a}} well-organized international court, if necessary. Cross-jurisdictional record sharing is more likely to occur with border sharing nations that have similar regional interests. This will be the focal point of section V: proposing a novel method to reach global prevention. Before an International Court to Combat Human Trafficking 12 is developed, two regional courts, an Eastern European Tribunal and a Southeast Asian Tribunal might be established. 13 Attempts at global prevention must first concentrate on the source countries. Any new treaty, tribunal, or court should attempt to harmonize current legal anti-trafficking laws, but also further provide for more plenary enforcement, conviction, and sentencing power using an ad hoc international tribunal.

Arbitration has in the last decade modernised itself, both in many <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> and internationally. This {{modernisation}} has led to a steady growth of arbitration practice in many countries. This book deals with legal and practical aspects of these developments, with particular reference to the Asia-Pacific region. David Spencer is one of the foremost scribes in Australian ADR and his regular case commentaries in the Australasian Dispute Resolution Journal provide an excellent source of information and insight on the topic. This book has evolved out of the author’s previous editions of Essential Dispute Resolution and, after the standard definitional treatments, it deals seriatim with negotiation, mediation, arbitration and other dispute resolution processes. There are chapters on court-annexed dispute resolution, ethics and standards, and legal issues...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the possibilities for}} the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitution of Bangladesh. Economic social and cultural rights {{are part of the}} “fundamental principles of state policy” which are recognized in Part II of the Bangladeshi Constitution. Article 8 (2) of the Constitution explicitly states that those principles are judicially unenforceable. At the international level, human rights were formally split into two different covenants in 1966 : the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The latter, unlike the former, contained no enforcement mechanism. This differential treatment of the economic, social and cultural rights reflected the traditional assumption that economic social and cultural rights were not capable of judicial enforcement. Those assumptions were later reflected in the Bangladeshi Constitution. This thesis critiques the main objections to the justiciability of economic social and cultural rights in the light of contemporary developments in the international human rights regime, regional human rights systems and different <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> It is posited that economic social and cultural rights have evolved so that their justiciability is now generally accepted. Indeed, the ICESCR (to which Bangladesh is a party) now casts an obligation on States Parties to make them justiciable in their <b>domestic</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> The thesis {{examines the}} substantive constitutional provisions and the relevant case law, and argues that there is in fact enough scope to judicially enforce economic, social and cultural rights contained in the Constitution of Bangladesh, despite the bar of article 8 (2). In this respect, comparative case law in India will also be examined, as India has similar constitutional provisions. Such new interpretations of the Bangladeshi Constitution, if adopted by Bangladesh’s courts, will act as guidelines for the development of judicial protections for economic, social and cultural rights at the municipal level in Bangladesh. Such a reformulation of constitutional law will also facilitate the fulfillment of Bangladesh’s obligations under the ICESCR, and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by its people...|$|R
