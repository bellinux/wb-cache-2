40|$|Abstract: Foreseeing the {{importance}} of managing forests for climate change mitigation and sustainable development, the Royal Government of Cambodia has put strong commitment to managing its remaining forests under the new anticipated international climate change agree-ment on REDD+ mechanism. Forestry Administration in collab-oration with Community Forestry International, and Terra Global Capital started a REDD project for Community Forestry sites in the northern province of Oddar Meanchey in 2007. Here, we report the methods and findings from our project and propose an appro-priate framework for effective implementation in Cambodia. Ten drivers and six agents of deforestation and forest degradation were identified and each driver could be reduced by adopting appropriate project actions. Changes in deforestation, carbon stocks, and project emissions were estimated under baseline and project scenarios. Our {{results suggest that the}} project is likely to lead to the reduction of about 8. 6 million tonne CO 2 over 30 -year project. Although policies and methods are available <b>for</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>the</b> project, sustained <b>commitment</b> and law enforcement play an increasingly important role in achieving real emission reduction and sustainable development...|$|R

By this, the Government of Poland expressed its will {{to participate in}} the action undertaken by the world's society to save the Earth's globe climate. On 26 October 1994 Poland became the Party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, by this obliged itself to <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> <b>commitments</b> to <b>the</b> Convention. To undertake the decision to ratify the Convention, required the particular courage, that since Poland is in phase of system and economy transformation. The Government of Poland shall make all necessary efforts to assure that modernisation of national economy will bring full success. The failure would also mean that commitments we adopted by the ratification of the Convention would not be implemented. We believe however, that with the nation's effort and with the friendly co-operation and help of the international community, we will direct our economy to the path of sustainable development and will <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> <b>commitments...</b>|$|R
