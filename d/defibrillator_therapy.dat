40|$|AbstractAccording to American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Practice Guidelines, {{electrolyte}} abnormalities, including abnormal serum potassium concentrations, {{are considered}} a correctable cause of a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Ventricular <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> in this situation is a class III indication, and thought to be ineffective and perhaps harmful, although there are minimal data to support this recommendation. The steady-state serum potassium concentration frequently changes during a cardiac arrest. Additionally, {{the vast majority of}} cardiac arrest patients have structural heart disease and are commonly treated with a variety of medications that can alter the serum potassium concentration. In the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial, patients with a correctable cause of an electrolyte imbalance were excluded from study participation but were followed in the AVID registry. Similar outcomes were observed among patients in the AVID registry and the main trial. Spironolactone therapy in patients with congestive heart failure decreases all-cause mortality and sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. In a preliminary study of 169 patients with an episode of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia treated with an implantable defibrillator, freedom from appropriate <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> was 18 % after five years. The probability of appropriate <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> was independent of the initial serum potassium concentration. For these reasons, our current clinical practice is to use an implantable defibrillator to treat an initial episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation that occurs in a patient with structural heart disease and an abnormal serum potassium concentration...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy {{caused by}} a TMEM 43 p. S 358 L mutation is a fully penetrant autosomal dominant cause of sudden cardiac death where prophylactic implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> significantly reduces mortality by returning lethal cardiac rhythms to normal. This qualitative study assessed the psychological ramifications of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator on recipients, their spouses and their mutation negative siblings. Design Qualitative interview study. Participants Twenty-one individuals (nine mutation positive, eight mutation negative and four spouses) from 15 families completed semi-structured interviews. Results No theoretical assumptions about the data were made: inductive sub-coding was accomplished with the constant comparison method and cohesive themes across all respondent interviews were determined. All interviewees had {{a family history of}} sudden cardiac death and appropriate implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> in themselves or family members. Average length of time with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was 10 years. Major themes included: (1) acceptance and gratitude, (2) grudging acceptance, (3) psychological effects (on emotional and psychological well-being; functioning of the broader family unit; and relationships), and (4) practical concerns (on clothes, travel, loss of driving licence and the effects of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator discharge). These affected all family members, regardless of mutation status. Conclusions Despite the survival advantage of implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy,</b> the intervention carries psychological and practical burdens for family members from kindreds manifesting p.

40|$|Cheyne-Stokes Respiration and Arrhythmias ObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether adequate treatment of Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) {{reduces the risk of}} arrhythmic events in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). MethodsA cohort of 403 registry patients with CHF (LVEF 45 %, NYHA-class 2) and implanted cardioverter-defibrillator devices (ICD) was studied. They underwent overnight polygraphy, with 221 having mild or no CSR (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 15 /h). Latter ones were offered therapy with adaptive servoventilation (ASV), which 96 patients accepted and 86 rejected. During follow-up (21 15 months) <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapies</b> were recorded in addition to clinical and physiologic measures of heart failure severity. ResultsEvent-free survival from (a) appropriate cardioverter-defibrillator therapies and (b) appropriately monitored ventricular arrhythmias was shorter in the untreated CSR group compared to the treated CSR and the no CSR group. Stepwise Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed untreated CSR (a: hazard ratio [HR] 1. 99, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 46 - 2. 72, P < 0. 001; b: HR 2. 19, 95 %CI 1. 42 - 3. 37, P < 0. 001), but not treated CSR (a: HR 1. 06, 95 %CI 0. 74 - 1. 50; P = 0. 77; b: HR 1. 21, 95 %CI 0. 75 - 1. 93, P = 0. 43) was an independent risk factor. The treated CSR group showed improvements in cardiac function and respiratory stability compared to the untreated CSR group. ConclusionThis study demonstrates a decrease of appropriate <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapies</b> by ASV treated CSR in patients with CHF and ICD.

40|$|AbstractThe {{assessment}} of defibrillation (DFT) efficacy {{has long been}} the standard of care during defibrillator implantation. To ensure an acceptable DFT safety margin, early defibrillator systems frequently required that the shock polarity and the location, type, or number of electrodes had to be altered. Advances in defibrillator and lead technology have resulted in lower and more consistent DFT thresholds in the range of 10 J, with an infrequent requirement to modify the DFT system. Yet, one can make an argument for and against continuation of DFT testing at the time of defibrillator implantation. The goal {{of this paper is to}} address both the data that do support and the data that do not support continuation of DFT testing at the time of device implantation. Scientifically, DFT testing should be abandoned only when prospective evidence demonstrates that defibrillator implantation without testing is as safe and has the same mortality benefits as implantation with testing. The most attractive aspect of eliminating DFT efficacy testing is that more patients may have the opportunity to be treated with this life-saving therapy. Perhaps there are alternative strategies to improve accessibility to <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> without possibly eroding its effectiveness. In the end, will lives be saved or lost if we discontinue DFT efficacy testing and lower the barriers to implantable <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} dysplasia/cardiomyopathy is {{a disorder}} characterized by frequent ventricular tachycardia originating {{from the right}} ventricle and fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium.

Direct current fulguration was used in the initial phase followed by radiofrequency catheter ablation.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation remarkably reduces the frequency of <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapies.</b> Direct current fulguration can still be considered in cases when radiofrequency ablation fails, though it requires higher expertise, general anesthesia and carries a higher morbidity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary {{prophylactic}} implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> (ICD) <b>therapy</b> {{is indicated}} {{for patients with}} reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We aimed to determine if preoperative clinical risk profiling can predict long-term benefit, and if clinical risk scores can be applied and improved in a patient cohort outside the clinical trial setting. METHODS: Using registry data, 789 patients with reduced LVEF who received ICDs for primary prevention during 2006 - 2011 were identified (age 64 ± 11 years, 82 % men, 63 % ischemic etiology, 52 % cardiac resynchronization <b>therapy</b> with <b>defibrillator).</b> The patients were divided into three risk groups, based {{on the presence of}} baseline clinical risk factors (age > 70, QRS duration > 120 ms, New York Heart Association class III-IV, atrial fibrillation history, or creatinine > 106 μmol/L). Endpoints were all-cause mortality and survival free of adequate ICD therapy. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 39 ± 18 months. Annual mortality was 7. 6 %, and increased with risk group (p <. 001). Rates of appropriate antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy were not statistically different between the groups, and ranged from 11 %- 16 % and 6 %- 14 %, respectively. By combining the previous risk score with data on diabetes, a better independent prediction of mortality was achieved; mortality rates then ranged from 11 % (low-risk) to 46 % (high-risk) (p <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapies</b> occur across the spectrum of comorbidities in a population with systolic heart failure. However, all-cause mortality is considerably higher in the group of patients with accumulated risk factors, and using the proposed scoring system can be helpful for the evaluation and risk stratification of the patient prior to making a decision for a primary prophylactic ICD implantation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of quadripolar versus bipolar cardiac resynchronization <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> systems. BackgroundQuadripolar left ventricular (LV) leads for cardiac resynchronization therapy reduce phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and are associated with reduced mortality compared with bipolar leads. MethodsA total of 606 patients received implants at 3 UK centers (319 Q, 287 B), between 2009 and 2014; mean follow-up was 879 days. Rehospitalization episodes were costed at National Health Service national tariff rates, and EQ- 5 D utility values were applied to heart failure admissions, acute coronary syndrome events, and mortality data, which were used to estimate quality-adjusted life-year differences over 5 years. ResultsGroups were matched with regard to age and sex. Patients with quadripolar implants had a lower rate of hospitalization than those with bipolar implants (42. 6 % vs. 55. 4 %; p = 0. 002). This was primarily driven by fewer hospital readmissions for heart failure (51 [16 %] vs. 75 [26. 1 %], respectively, for quadripolar vs. bipolar implants; p = 0. 003) and generator replacements (9 [2. 8 %] vs. 19 [6. 6 %], respectively; p = 0. 03). Hospitalization for suspected acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, device explantation, and lead revisions were similar. This lower health-care utilization cost translated into a cumulative 5 -year cost saving for patients with quadripolar systems where the acquisition cost was <£ 932 (US $ 1, 398) compared with bipolar systems. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results mirrored the deterministic calculations. For the average additional price of £ 1, 200 (US $ 1, 800) over a bipolar system, the incremental cost-effective ratio was £ 3, 692 per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($ 5, 538), far below the usual willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20, 000 (US $ 30, 000). ConclusionsIn a UK health-care 5 -year time horizon, the additional purchase price of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> systems is largely offset by lower subsequent event costs up to 5 years after implantation, which makes this technology highly cost-effective compared with bipolar systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether clinical or electrophysiologic characteristics could predict initial and subsequent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy. BACKGROUNDIdentification of markers to predict subsequent ICD therapy and symptoms after the first event could affect patient management. METHODSWe analyzed baseline and follow-up data on 125 ICD patients followed for 408 ± 321 days. Medications and ICD programming were not changed after first ICD therapy. RESULTSImplantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> occurred in 58 patients (46 %). Clinical features were as follows: mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 29 % ± 15 %; coronary artery disease 84 %; presenting arrhythmia with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) in 68 %. In a multivariate analysis the relative risk for ICD therapy in patients presenting with SMVT versus cardiac arrest (CA) was 2. 57 (range, 1. 32 to 5. 01), and for patients with LVEF ≤ 25 %, 1. 95 (1. 11 to 3. 45), respectively (p < 0. 05). Implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> was not predicted by any other variable. Forty-six patients had second ICD therapy. Mean time to second ICD therapy was only 66 ± 93 days compared with 138 ± 168 days for first ICD therapy (p < 0. 05). No predictor for second ICD therapy was found. Regarding symptoms, impaired consciousness during initial ICD therapy was predicted only by SMVT cycle length < 250 ms at electrophysiologic testing. In contrast, symptoms were similar between first and second ICD therapy (p = 0. 0001). Of note, ventricular tachycardia cycle length preceding first and second ICD therapy was similar (r = 0. 76, p = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONSFirst ICD therapy tends to occur in patients presenting with SMVT and LVEF ≤ 25 %. Subsequent therapy occurs sooner and is unpredictable, suggesting that antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be considered after the first symptomatic ICD therapy. Symptoms during first ICD therapy predict subsequent symptoms, and patients presenting with SMVT and asymptomatic first ICD therapy are at very low risk for future syncopal ICD therapy...|$|E

Triggering factors can rarely be identified. OBJECTIVES: Several studies have revealed seasonal variations in the frequency of cardiovascular events and life-threatening arrhythmias, and we sought to establish whether seasonal factors may exacerbate ventricular electrical instability leading to arrhythmia clusters and electrical storm. METHODS: Two hundred and fourteen consecutive defibrillator recipients were followed-up during 3. 3 +/- 2. 2 years. Arrhythmia cluster was defined as the occurrence of three or more arrhythmic events triggering appropriate <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapies</b> within 2 weeks. Time intervals between two clusters were calculated for each month and each season, and were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni adjustment. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 698 patient years, 98 arrhythmia clusters were observed in 51 patients; clustering {{ventricular arrhythmias}} were associated with temporal variables; they occurred more frequently in the winter and spring months than during the summer and fall. Accordingly, the time intervals between two clusters were significantly shorter during winter and spring (median and 95 % CI) : winter 16 (5 - 19), spring 11. 5 (7 - 25), summer 34. 5 (15 - 55), fall 50. 5 (19 - 65), P = 0. 0041.
