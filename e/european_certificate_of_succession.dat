40|$|Since 17 August 2015, the Succession Regulation is {{applicable}} in the European Member States, establishing uniform rules on the jurisdiction and applicable law for cross-border successions. The Succession Regulation also introduces a <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession,</b> allowing heirs, legatees, administrators {{of the estate}} and executors of wills to prove their legal capacity and rights in another Member State. As such, the <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> offers a supranational alternative to national instruments with a similar purpose which exist in many Member States, but often do not produce their full effects abroad. In general, the European Certificate of Succession's legal regime is comprehensive and practical, especially as regards its content and procedural aspects. Nevertheless, there remain a few fundamental conceptual lacunae. In particular, it is unclear {{to what extent the}} <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> can give rise to registration in the Member States' land registers, as well as how the European Certificate and the corresponding national instruments relate to each other.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the number of cross-border successions, it has become more and more important to provide a uniform regulation, at a European level, of international private law in the field of successions. At the same time, this phenomenon has widen the differences existing among the national rules, where - especially in the civil law tradition - the plurality of the instruments for proving the quality of heir is already known. Just to give a few examples, the German Erbschein and the French acte de notoriété can be recalled; besides, few legal systems - such as Italy - do not know a general instrument certifying the quality of heir. The Regulation 650 / 12 /EU has been enforced to fulfill such needs. In particular, the above said Regulation institutes the <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession,</b> which aims to become a preferential proof of the quality of heir. The Regulation 650 / 12 /EU outlines detailed rules, covering its effects - with limited value of presumption -, its issue, contents and circulation. In conclusion, the <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> is a new instrument, and its achievement will be the simplification of the transfer of assets by reason of death; moreover, it will also implement the protection of third parties contracting with the alleged heirs and the legatees of the assets. Such instrument will have an expansive power in the Italian legal system, with the effect that the application of the Certificate of Succession already existing in the districts covered by the ‘libro fondiario’ recording system could be extended to the rest of the country...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sweden applies two {{different}} private international statutes to establish which country´s domestic law that is applicable {{in a certain}} situation regarding succession and will with connection to two or more states. The first private international law is the one used in relations between Sweden and the other Nordic states.

The request addresses the issue as to whether provisions of Regulation (EU) No 650 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and {{on the creation of}} a <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> must be interpreted as permitting refusal to recognise the material effects of a legacy by vindication (legatum per vindicationem), as provided for by Polish succession law, if that legacy concerns the right of ownership of immovable property located in a Member State the law of which does not provide for legacies having direct material effect, such as Germany.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Regulation (EU) No 650 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on jurisdiction, {{applicable}} law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and {{on the creation of}} a <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> (regulation on succession). This regulation will be applicable in the matters of successions with cross-border implications of people who will decease on 17 August 2015 or later. Regulation on succession unifies legislation in matters of succession with cross-border implications, both in terms of substantive law and procedural law. This regulation has been expected {{for a long time in}} the European Union because the succession matters were expressly excluded from the scope of other regulations. Also thanks to the free movement of persons, the unification of this area of law is becoming more necessary from day to day. The preparation of this regulation and the connected discussions lasted several years. Not only for the numerous differences between the national rules of the Member States but also for the intention to create a complete unification of the substantive law, the succession proceedings itself and of the recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions.

40|$|When someone dies {{there will}} always be an {{inheritance}}, an inheritance that earlier has been seen as a national concern. However, every year there are about 450 000 deaths within the European Union linked to more than one country, either when the deceased has changed his state of residence or when he has assets in another state, for example a Swedish national with a summer house in Spain. The problem is to determine which na-tional law that is supposed to be applicable to the inheritance. There are two principles that can be applicable on the choice of law, the principle of na-tionality and the principle of residency. If the principle of nationality is used the inherit-ance will be regulated by the deceased`s citizenship while the principle of residency takes aim on the deceased´s last domicile instead. Conflicts can occur between the two principles so that the legacy must be divided between two different legislations. In October 2009 the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and authentic instruments in matters of succession {{and the creation of a}} <b>European</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> was presented, a regulation that will try to create harmonized rules on in-teralia the inheritance matters. The principle of residency is supposed to be the general rule according to the regulation, but the deceased should still have the privilege to choose the rules in his country of nationality to govern the succession. But is it really necessary to harmonize the rules of applicable law or is it satisfying with the rules that is today? This is questions that will be answered in this essay...|$|E

40|$|Point-of-care {{functional}} neonatal echocardiography (fnECHO) {{is increasingly}} {{used to assess}} haemodynamic status or patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA). In Australasia, 90 % of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) practice point-of-care fnECHO. The Australian Society of Ultrasound Medicine offers a training certificate for fnECHO. In Europe, the use and indications of fnECHO {{and the extent of}} point-of-care fnECHO training and accreditation are unknown. We aimed to assess utilisation and training of fnECHO in Europe. For this, we conducted an email survey of 45 randomly chosen tertiary NICUs in 17 European countries. The recall rate was 89 % (n = 40). Neonatologists with skills in fnECHO worked in 29 NICUs (74 %), but paediatric cardiologists would routinely perform most fnECHOs. Twenty-four-hour echocardiography service was available in 31 NICUs (78 %). Indications for fnECHO included assessment of haemodynamic volume status (53 %), presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (55 %), indication for and effect of volume replacement therapy (58 %), PDA assessment and monitoring of PDA treatment (80 %). Teaching of fnECHO was offered to trainees in 22 NICUs (55 %). Teaching of fnECHO was provided by paediatric cardiologists (55 %) or by neonatologists (45 %). Only six (15 %) national colleges accredited fnECHO teaching courses. Conclusion: fnECHO is widely practiced by neonatologists across Europe for a broad range of clinical questions. However, {{there is a lack of}} formal training and accreditation of fnECHO skills. This could be addressed by designing a dedicated European fnECHO training programme and by agreeing on a common <b>European</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> fnECHO. ...|$|R
