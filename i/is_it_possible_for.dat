The south polar latitudes below the Antarctic Circle are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two tropics <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the Sun to be directly overhead (at the zenith).|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E
500|$|After the episode's broadcast, Popular Mechanics {{published}} an article analyzing the science depicted. They concluded that the Brain–computer interface (BCI) chips, like the ones used in the episode to tie the victims' brains to the computer used by Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak, have also been used on real-life human subjects, though not in relation to controlling sleep cycles. However, the article continued that it is [...] "not currently possible" [...] for BCI chips to [...] "facilitate direct transfer of understandable information from one person's brain to another", nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the chips to [...] "directly read another person's thoughts or dreams" [...] and steal them. In addition, Popular Mechanics noted that Walter's theory of the victims' deaths being caused by exhaustion is [...] "pure bunk", as there are many long-term experiments that have safely tested humans' deprivation of REM sleep. According to one scientist interviewed, though chips shown in [...] "Dream Logic" [...] cause hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and a disconnect from reality, these traits are [...] "not even remotely possible" [...] outside of fiction.|$|E

For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born—he just changed.

2500|$|In the {{top-down}} view, global {{features of}} personality influence {{the way a}} person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits. Top-down theories of SWB suggest that people have a genetic predisposition to be happy or unhappy and this predisposition determines their SWB [...] "setpoint". Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB {{is a consequence of}} hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth. [...] Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high heritability (40% and 55% respectively in one study). Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not {{rule out the possibility that}} <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> individuals to experience long term changes in SWB.|$|E
2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E

"How <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> MPs {{to consult}} with their {{constituencies}} about the bills if {{they have not yet}} received them less than a week before Parliament is due to sit to discuss them? If MPs cannot consult with their electorates about the bills, how can they properly represent their views about these bills which will become laws that will affect their day-to-day lives? Such late notice and late provision of the bills demonstrates that the Government is not at all committed to the “stampa” principle of democracy and good governance, which is the representation of the people by leaders they elect to represent them. It reflects the Government’s attitude that because it has a majority in Parliament - which means its bills will automatically be passed - {{there is no need for}} the grassroots to know about these laws that it intends to pass, which will nevertheless affect their lives. This is an arrogant and undemocratic attitude which, unfortunately, has come to characterize our system of parliamentary democracy and particularly the approach of the major parties which have been in Government over the last 20 years. [...] I have been telling communities in Port Vila that I will consult with them about the 2009 Government budget, to get their views to present in Parliament, and I am very disappointed and angry that the Government, by their late notice, has meant that this will be very difficult, if not impossible." ...|$|E
