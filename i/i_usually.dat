25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E
25|$|This Lingering Life (2015) premiered at the Theatre of Yugen. The {{play was}} {{inspired}} by 14th century Japanese Noh plays, which Miyagawa studied in Japan during her Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship. The play retells nine ancient Japanese stories with 27 characters, all which have no names. Miyagawa {{said in an interview}} that the characters, “they are identified by their types, such as Crazy Woman, Mystical Warrior, Woman with Tragic Hair, and Gangster on the Run, in an attempt to create sympathetic characters without making them into our neighbors.” The play received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post said, “Miyagawa's plays, this one especially, sit somewhere between this world and another world. They also commit so fully to their own aesthetic that <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> find myself pondering the fascinating rules of this alternate existence hours or even days later (this lingering life indeed).” The New Yorker praised the play as” clever, stylish, and often funny”.|$|E
