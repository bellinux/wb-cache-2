The Port of Salomague was an ancient port of call of seafarers, merchants and traders from different Asian countries. During the American occupation, it served as a mooring place from boats that ferried across the Pacific where thousands of Ilocanos worked at sugar plantations in Hawaii and California. Now leased to a private corporation, It is the transshipment port of goods and products to Taiwan. It is also the unloading point of commercial fishing vessels. The Salomague Island <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> inhabitants until the owners choose to have it uninhabited. A 1109-hectare island, it can be reached in less than five (5) minutes ride through a banca.

Although these concepts are used frequently, they are rarely defined. The authors offer three definitions that can be used separately or in combination.

It is necessary to be clear about which definition <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a mutual understanding of what is to be achieved through social sustainability.
