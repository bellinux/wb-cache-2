40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the person of JUDr. Karel <b>Hostaš.</b> The aim of the thesis is to map the scope of {{activities}} of JUDr. Karel <b>Hostaš</b> while focusing on his historiographical and archaeological activities. JUDr. Karel <b>Hostaš</b> was born, {{lived and worked in}} Klatovy and is therefore inextricably linked with Klatovy's region, however, his work, with its significance, has transcended regional borders. Following a chapter with his biography there are chapters that focus on the work of JUDr. Karel Hostaš: he was universally oriented person engaged in advocacy and notary, public political activities, collections, museum and ethnographic researches, archival science and literary activities. This is followed by the main section, which is devoted to historiography, archival and archaeological activities of JUDr. Karel <b>Hostaš...</b>|$|R

500|$|At the Botanic Garden he {{developed}} {{a special interest in}} Vinca, Epimedium, <b>Hosta</b> and Symphytum, all of which he published monographs on. A series of botanical publications followed, starting with a new species of Allium (A. farreri Stearn, 1930). Stearn repeatedly returned to the genus Allium, and was considered a world expert on it; many species bear his name. 1930 would also see his first bibliographic work, on the botanist Reginald Farrer, whom he named Allium farreri after, and also described Rosa farreri (1933) and other species named after Farrer. It was while he was compiling Farrer's works in 1930 that he came across the latter's work, The English Rock-Garden (1919) and its account of Barren-worts (Epimedium), and kindled a lifetime interest in the genus. From 1932, he produced a series of papers on this genus, studying it at Cambridge, Kew and Paris. It became one of the genera which he was best known, and many species of which now bear his name. Epimedium and the related woodland perennial Vancouveria (Berberidaceae) would be the subject of his first monograph (1938) [...] and were genera to which he would return {{at the end of his}} life. At the time the taxonomy of this genus was very confused, and with the help of the Cambridge Herbarium he obtained specimens from all over Europe to produce a comprehensive monograph. The work was so thorough that it was mistakenly considered a doctoral thesis by other botanists. He also began a series of contributions to the catalogue of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin.|$|E
500|$|The United States started {{exploring}} the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and {{the acquisition of}} the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{became interested in the}} canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco <b>Hosta,</b> explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as [...] "a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day." [...] Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins. They described the kivas as [...] "circular apartments sunk in the ground". Simpson briefly explored Chetro Ketl, documenting six of its round rooms and 124 rooms {{on the ground floor of}} the four-story building. He noted an especially well preserved room where [...] "the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation." [...] Vivian credits Simpson's 1850 report detailing their brief exploration of the canyon and Richard H. Kern's lithographs as the beginning of Chacoan archeology. The scientific investigation of Chaco Canyon started when Richard Wetherill began his exploration of the canyon in 1895. Wetherill was well known for his discovery of some of the largest Ancestral Puebloan dwellings in Mesa Verde, and after an invitation from amateur archeologist Sidney Palmer to survey Chaco Canyon, organized a one-month expedition to the region. He secured financial backing for a full season soon afterward, and in 1896 full-scale excavations began at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E
