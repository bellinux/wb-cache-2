40|$|The <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction,</b> {{defined as}} the ratio of ETactual over (P + Vc), relates {{parameters}} of the water balance of an irrigated area {{with each other in}} such a way that the (water) manager obtains information on the rate of change of water stored in the area (soil moisture and groundwater). If the <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> equals about 0. 6 water storage in the area is stable, while water is stored for lower values of the <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction.</b> If the value of the <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> exceeds 0. 6, the volume of water stored in the area decreases. Part of this decrease is due to natural drainage and part due to capillary rise into the root zone of the irrigated crop. Despite this capillary rise the actual evapo-transpiration drops below the potential ET-value. For most crops, a decrease of ET by about 15 % would result to a higher productivity in terms of yield per cubic meter water. However, the yield per hectare (and thus farm income) would decrease. Management of an irrigation system is recommended {{in such a way that}} the monthly values of the <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> range between 0. 5 and 0. 8.

40|$|Background: We {{are at the}} {{beginning}} of a new era where regenerative medicine is really starting to take hold. An appreciation of adult stem cells and their role in tissue maintenance have heralded novel insight into endometrial remodelling. The idea that human endometrium could be a plentiful source of adult stem/progenitor cells (ASPCs) has captured the imagination of many stem cell biologists. Not only that, they are also hypothesised to be involved in endometrial proliferative diseases, such as endometriosis. However, work remains preliminary and is stunted by a lack of specific endometrial stem cell markers. Recently, stage specific embryonic antigen - 1 (SSEA- 1) was proposed as a candidate epithelial ASPC marker in adult endometrium. In order to validate this, stem cell assays are required. These assays include measurements of clonogenicity, prolonged self-renewal and differentiation potential. Aim: To assess the differentiation potential of SSEA- 1 + cells in vitro. Methods: All endometrial culture samples were collected from pre-menopausal women undergoing surgery for benign disease at Liverpool Women’s Hospital (LWH). Epithelial cells were cultured in 3 D MatrigelTM to produce gland-like structures. Gland-like structures were characterised via immuno-histochemistry, to validate their resemblance to glands in endometrial tissue in vivo. To assess multi-potency, magnetic cell sorted (MACS) SSEA- 1 enriched and <b>depleted</b> cell <b>fractions</b> were cultured in adipogenic and osteogenic inducing media. In order to assess pluripotency, SSEA- 1 enriched and <b>depleted</b> <b>fractions</b> were cultured in neurogenic media. Results: SSEA- 1 enriched cell fractions had a greater propensity to produce gland-like structures in 3 D culture than SSEA- 1 <b>depleted</b> cell <b>fractions.</b> Gland-like structures best resembled glands in post-menopausal (PM) endometrium. Non-gland like structures also formed in 3 D culture from endometriosis samples, which stained exclusively and intensely for CK 5 / 6. SSEA- 1 enriched and <b>depleted</b> <b>fractions</b> were unable to differentiate into other cell types of mesodermal lineage. However, both enriched and <b>depleted</b> <b>fractions</b> were able to produce ectodermal derived neural-like PGP 9. 5 positive cells. Discussion: This work confirms SSEA- 1 is a reliable epithelial ASPC marker in adult endometrium. SSEA- 1 + cells possess an increased ability to produce gland-like structures, reminiscent of in vivo endometrial glands. This therefore confirms unipotency. The presence of CK 5 / 6 in non-gland-like structures from endometriosis samples suggests a potential role in endometriosis aetiology, and warrants further work. SSEA- 1 enriched and depleted cells were unable to undergo multi-lineage differentiation, but were capable of producing neural-like cells. As both cell populations were unable to demonstrate multipotency, it unlikely SSEA- 1 enriched/depleted cells are pluripotent. More likely, a neural progenitor may exist in adult endometrium, one that has been included in both cell populations. Given the close proximity of endometrial glands to the placenta, the commitment of epithelial stem cells could be an ancillary mechanism to prevent maternal microchimersim in offspring, which is associated with a number of pathologies...|$|R

METHODS: Mice (4 -week-old CD 1 male mice) were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain, and infection allowed to establish until a parasitaemia of 30 % was attained. Total plasma and albumin depleted plasma samples from infected and control (non-infected) mice were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE). After staining, the gels were imaged and differential protein expression patterns were interrogated using image analysis software.

The T-ceIl <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> obtained after elutrlation contained higher levels of NSCA than the unseparated BM. Further separation of this graft fraction by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation revealed high levels of radiosensitive NSCA in the low density (< 1. 070) fraction which represented 0. 5 % of the original BM population. These cells were of blast morphology, stained intensely wIth a dansylated derivative of cyciosporine A (dans C 8 A) and weakly expressed macrophage/granulocyte antigens and non-specific esterase (NSE). These cells were initially non-adherent but proliferated in culture to produce intensely NSE positive, adherent, phagocytic cells of macrophage morphology.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate if separation of Hepatitis C virions into antibody enriched and antibody depleted fractions segregates quasispecies populations into distinctive swarms. Results: A HCV genotype 4 a specimen was fractionated into IgG-depleted and IgG-enriched fractions by use of Albumin/IgG depletion spin column. Clonal analysis of these two fractions was performed and then compared to an unfractionated sample. Following sequence analysis it was evident that the antibody <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> was significantly more heterogeneous than the antibody enriched fraction, revealing a unique quasispecies profile. An in-frame 3 nt insertion was observed in 26 % of clones in the unfractionated population and in 64 % of clones in the IgG-depleted fraction.

40|$|Plasma is {{the most}} easily {{accessible}} source for biomarker discovery in clinical proteomics. However, identifying potential biomarkers from plasma is a challenge given the large dynamic range of proteins. The potential biomarkers in plasma are generally present at very low abundance levels and hence identification of these low abundance proteins necessitates the depletion of highly abundant proteins. Sample pre-fractionation using immuno-depletion of high abundance proteins using multi-affinity removal system (MARS) has been a popular method to deplete multiple high abundance proteins. However, depletion of these abundant proteins can result in concomitant removal of low abundant proteins. Although there are some reports suggesting the removal of non-targeted proteins, the predominant view is that number of such proteins is small. In this study, we identified proteins that are removed along with the targeted high abundant proteins. Three plasma samples were depleted using {{each of the three}} MARS (Hu- 6, Hu- 14 and Proteoprep 20) cartridges.

Further, total IgG from selected RA patients and controls were purified, and a <b>fraction</b> was <b>depleted</b> for anti-hPAD 4 antibodies. Kinetic deimination assays were performed with total IgG and <b>depleted</b> <b>fractions.</b> The kcat and Km values of hPAD 4 -mediated deimination of N-α-Benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester were not affected by the depletion of the anti-hPAD 4 antibodies from the total IgG pool. In conclusion, RA patients remain positive for anti-hPAD 4 antibodies over time and some patients who are initially anti-hPAD 4 negative become positive later in the disease course. The anti-hPAD 4 antibodies did not affect the enzymatic activity of hPAD 4 when the small substrate N-α-Benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester was used. However, this finding may not exclude an effect of these autoantibodies on citrullination of protein substrates in RA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time Of Flight (SELDI-TOF) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as new approach for blood biomarker discovery. However, results obtained {{so far have been}} often disappointing as this technique still has difficulties to detect low-abundant plasma and serum proteins. Results We used a serum depletion scheme using chicken antibodies against various abundant proteins to realized a pre-fractionation of serum prior to SELDI-TOF profiling. Depletion of major serum proteins by immunocapture was confirmed by 1 D and 2 D gel electrophoresis. SELDI-TOF analysis of bound and unbound (<b>depleted)</b> serum <b>fractions</b> revealed that this approach allows the detection of new low abundant protein peaks with satisfactory reproducibility. Conclusion The combination of immunocapture and SELDI-TOF analysis opens new avenues into proteomic profiling for the discovery of blood biomarkers. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{combined}} information from GIS and satellite remote sensing with ground data, {{this research has}} developed a water balance model of the Roxo catchment (Portugal) by using Thornthwaite-Mather method based on the recent climatological data (2001 - 2003) {{in order to assess}} available water for the irrigation at present. Annual runoff from the catchment predicted by the model is 29 million m, which is accumulated in the Roxo reservoir. Almost all the catchment runoff is contributed by the direct runoff. There is no significant groundwater runoff in the region. However, there is some groundwater flow {{in the northern part of}} the catchment. The reservoir receives another 4 million m of water from the rainfall in a year, which makes 33 million m of the total inflow per annum to the reservoir. Annual supply of water for irrigation, domestic use and industrial use from the reservoir, at present, is of water goes back to atmosphere through the evapotranspiration process in a year. This means that the annual outflow from the reservoir is around 33. 5 million m. So, the outflow has been a little bit higher than the inflow over the past three years. This may be an indication of severe water scarcity in near future. Therefore, there is a challenge for efficient use of water in the region. The <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> during May - September, which is the core irrigation season, is around or higher than 1. This indicates the short supply of irrigation to the crops. Various irrigation performance indicators also describes that none of the major crops in the Roxo irrigation command area has a sufficient supply of water. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) is applied to calculate actual evapotranspiration (ET a) by using four Landsat and eleven Modis images [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{therapeutic}} {{capacity of}} human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (HUCB-MNC) and stem cells derived thereof is documented in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, while mechanisms behind {{the reduction of}} lesion size and the observed improvement of behavioral skills still remain poorly understood. Methods A human in vitro model of neuronal hypoxia was used to address the impact of total HUCB-MNC (tMNC), a stem cell enriched fraction (CD 133 +, 97. 38 % CD 133 -positive cells) and a stem cell <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction</b> (CD 133 -, 0. 06 % CD 133 -positive cells) of HUCB-MNC by either direct or indirect co-cultivation with post-hypoxic neuronal cells (differentiated SH-SY 5 Y). Over three days, development of apoptosis and necrosis of neuronal cells, chemotaxis of MNC and production of chemokines (CCL 2, CCL 3, CCL 5, CXCL 8, CXCL 9) and growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, VEGF, bFGF) were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy, FACS and cytometric bead array. Results tMNC, CD 133 + and surprisingly CD 133 - reduced neuronal apoptosis in direct co-cultivations significantly to levels {{in the range of}} normoxic controls (7 % ± 3 %). Untreated post-hypoxic control cultures showed apoptosis rates of 85 % ± 11 %. tMNC actively migrated towards injured neuronal cells. Both co-cultivation types using tMNC or CD 133 - reduced apoptosis comparably. CD 133 - produced high concentrations of CCL 3 and neuroprotective G-CSF within indirect co-cultures. Soluble factors produced by CD 133 + cells were not detectable in direct co-cultures. Conclusion Our data show that heterogeneous tMNC and even CD 133 -depleted fractions have the capability not only to reduce apoptosis in neuronal cells but also to trigger the retaining of neuronal phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|BALB/c mice {{have been}} an {{exceptional}} susceptibility to Leishmania tropica infection such that cutaneous lesions grow without restraint in all cases leading to fatal metastasis and visceralization in normal and x-irradiated, bone-marrow reconstituted (XBM) animals. Adult thymectomized, x-irradiated, bone marrow-reconstituted (ATxXBM) BALB/c mice, however, show pronounced retardation of lesion growth leading to some survival and even cures. A similar trend was also found in moderately susceptible (BALB/c X C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 mice, {{in contrast with the}} "resistant" CBA strain, in which, as previously known, ATxXBM animals showed impairment of normal, spontaneous self-healing. These convere effects are paralleled by respective leishmania-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivities, prior thymectomy leading to diminution in CBA and augmentation in BALB/c and (BALB/c X C 57 BL/ 6) F 1. Anti-leishmanial DTH responses, amplfiable by cyclophosphamide pretreatment, can be detected in BALB/c mice within 10 d of infection with 2 X 10 (7) promastigotes, but becomes near-totally suppressed by day 25 - 35. No such suppressin is found in CBA, C 57 BL/ 6, or (BALB/c X C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 mice together with varying degrees of immune control of lesion development or regression. Suppression of DTH in BALB/c mice is leishmania specific and does not extent to 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) or sheep erythrocytes specificities. Spleen cells from suppressed L. tropica-infected mice when transferred to normal BALB/c mice impaired the induction of DTH to leishmanial antigen. This property resided in the T cell-enriched fraction and not in the T cell- <b>depleted</b> <b>fraction.</b> It is concluded that a major component of the striking inability of BALB/c mice to control L. tropica infection involves profound impairment of a potentially curative cell-mediated immune response by suppressor T cell generation. The possibility is discussed that this may be secondary to rapid amastigote (antigen) accumulation in macrophages expressing the primary genetic "defect. ...|$|E
40|$|Disorder {{effects in}} the {{thermodynamic}} properties of a ideal Bose gas confined in a semi-infinite multi-layer structure %described by $M$ permeable barriers within a box of thickness $L$ and infinite lateral extent, are analyzed. The layers are first modeled by a periodic array of $M$ Dirac delta-functions of equal intensity. Then, we introduce structural and compositional disorder, {{as well as a}} random set of layer vacancies in the system to calculate the internal energy, chemical potential and the specific heat for different configurations. Whereas structural and compositional disorder does not reveal a significant change, a dramatic increase in the maximum of the specific heat is observed when the system is <b>depleted</b> a <b>fraction</b> of the order of $ 0. 1 $ to $ 0. 2 $ of random layers compared to the original, fully periodic array. Furthermore, this maximum, which is reminiscent of a Bose-Einstein condensation for an infinite array, occurs at higher temperatures. Comment: Six pages and 8 eps figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{haemolymph}} of larvae of Prosimulium mixtum Syme & Davies/P. fuscum Syme & Davies and Simulium venustum Say parasitised by the mermithid nematode Neomesomermis flumenalis {{was compared}} with that of unparasitised hosts with respect to protein, amino acid and carbohydrate composition. The mermithid <b>depleted</b> most protein <b>fractions</b> in a non-selective manner in both hosts. In P. mixtum/P. fuscum, the levels of most amino compounds were reduced by mermithid parasitism, but these metabolites were approximately evenly divided into 3 categories (decreased, increased and unaffected by parasitism) in S. venustum. The mermithid caused a significant decrease of haemolymph glucose levels in both host species but did not affect blood trehalose concentrations. These effects of parasitism are discussed in relation to the nematode&# 39;s nutritional requirements. ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:Haemolymph of larval Prosimulium mixtum/fuscum and Simulium venustum naturally infected with Neomesomermis flumenalis was {{compared with that}} of non-infected hosts. The mermithid <b>depleted</b> most protein <b>fractions</b> in a non-selective manner in both host species. In P. mixtum/fuscum the levels of 21 of the 32 amino compounds were reduced by infection, 5 were increased and 6 were unaltered. In S. venustum the levels of 14 amino compounds were increased, 10 were decreased and 8 remained unaltered. Levels of trehalose were unaffected by infection in both hosts, but blood glucose levels were severely reduced, particularly in P. mixtum/fuscum. ...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{treatment}} for glioma includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy but {{the outcome of}} patients is very poor. Antineoplastic drugs are usually administered alone or in combination for variable times (continuously or in cycles) in a single phase schedule. In this study we explored in vitro the antiproliferative effect of a 2 phases treatment. In the first phase, glioma cells where treated for 3 - 4 weeks with hydroxyurea (HU) or aphidicolin and then for 4 weeks with salinomycin, a drug that preferentially inhibits the proliferation of cancer stem cells. We found that salinomycin, is able to slowly <b>deplete</b> the <b>fraction</b> of glioma cells that survive the exposure to HU or aphidicolin. Surviving cells were killed at salinomycin concentrations lower than those required to kill untreated cells. The fraction of surviving cell showed traits of senescence including increased activity of the senescence associated -β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) marker. Our data suggest that drug-induced senescent cells may constitute a novel target for cancer treatment and can be exploited in a two phases therapeutic regimen...|$|R
