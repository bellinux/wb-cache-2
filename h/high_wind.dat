5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|August 28, 1991 — Hurricane Bob comes {{within a}} short {{distance}} of making landfall on the eastern tip of Long Island as a category2 hurricane. Heavy rainfall up to 7inches (175mm) and <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> gusts causes two deaths and $75million (1991USD, $117million 2007USD), as well as severe beach erosion which came {{as a result of}} storm surge up to 6feet (2m) above average.|$|E
5|$|From {{late morning}} to early afternoon, another squall line moved through {{northern}} parts of Mississippi and Alabama as <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> shear and low-level moisture persisted. However, this time several discrete supercells developed along {{and in front}} of the line, spawning seven weak tornadoes across Morgan, Limestone, and Madison Counties in northern Alabama around noon that day.|$|E
50|$|In 2003-04, {{most of the}} {{organised}} {{events were}} cancelled at short notice due to very <b>high</b> <b>winds.</b> Similarly, the 2006-07 celebrations in Edinburgh were cancelled on the day, again due to <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> and heavy rain.|$|R
50|$|Like Jubilee Odyssey, Millennium Roller Coaster is also {{affected}} by <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> (though not {{as badly as}} Jubilee Odyssey) and so {{in the case of}} bad weather or <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> Millennium Roller Coaster will not operate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>highest</b> {{sustained}} <b>wind</b> {{speed was}} 13 m/s, occurring on July 13; the <b>highest</b> daily mean <b>wind</b> speed was 9 m/s (July 13); and the <b>highest</b> <b>wind</b> gust speed was 19 m/s (February 4).|$|R
5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> velocities have not lasted more than four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h). It crippled traffic on the lakes and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day. Dean’s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> advisory.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. It {{was caused by}} <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> speeds, {{in excess of the}} {{construction}} dimensions, cracking the tail rudder and vertical stabilizer, crashing the plane in the sea after eight seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{very low}} {{relative}} humidity, <b>high</b> <b>winds,</b> and low fuel moisture {{coupled with the}} steep topography made containing the fire very difficult.

5|$|August 30, 2005— The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Katrina produce heavy rainfall up to 5inches (125mm) {{of rain in}} the western portion of the state. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> also affect the state, with 4,500people in Buffalo left without power after <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> downed trees and power lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>High</b> <b>winds,</b> driving rain, and {{occasional}} snow hit Northern Ireland. Ice, floods and fallen trees affected most roads. Gale-force winds ripped through Downpatrick and County Londonderry overnight. The Foyle Bridge {{in the city}} of Derry was closed to high-sided vehicles due to <b>high</b> <b>winds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} of February 10–11, 2009 occurred on February10 and February11, 2009, affecting portions {{of both the}} Central and Eastern United States. During the two-day period, 15tornadoes touched down in seven states. Oklahoma was struck by six tornadoes, {{the most of any}} state. The first day of the outbreak produced the most tornadoes; the second brought mainly <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> damage and rain or snow in most of the Northeast.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, <b>high</b> <b>wind,</b> flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{then the}} term [...] "snowburst" [...] {{has been used}} to {{describe}} any heavy lake effect snowfall not accompanied by <b>high</b> <b>winds.</b> If <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> are present the conditions are referred to as [...] "snow squalls"; and in extreme circumstances it becomes a blizzard.|$|R
50|$|Sailors on Cheap Shot, a Heritage One-Ton, noted <b>winds</b> as <b>high</b> as 70 knots {{near the}} Manitous & Sleeping Bear. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> {{began in the}} evening and persisted for 7 hours, with long train waves over 20 feet. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> {{followed}} many hours of extreme calm & fog punctuated by the fog horn from the nearby cutter, Mackinaw. The straight line <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> from the north force several yachts to opt out. There was at least one boat dismasted and another with a lost rudder.|$|R
500|$|Raptor is {{adversely}} affected by unfavourable weather conditions as both a high altitude and high velocity ride.

5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced the cancellation of the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not safe in heavy rain and <b>high</b> <b>wind.</b> Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, as did about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} {{close to the}} United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.|$|E
5|$|As Jimena passed {{south of}} Hawaii as a {{weakening}} tropical storm, it brought high winds and heavy rainfall to the island. <b>High</b> <b>wind</b> gusts of 53–58mph (85–93km/h) {{were reported in}} South Point and Kahoolawe. In Honolulu, a weather station reported winds of 36mph (58km/h) while a station in Kauai reported winds of 22mph (35km/h). The storm dropped 6–10inches of rain across the Big Island. In Glenwood, Hawaii, the storm dropped 8.43inches (214mm) of rain. The rainfall from Jimena helped reduce drought conditions across the Big Island. Coastal sections of the Hawaiian Islands reported high surf ranging from 11 to 15feet (3–5meters) high.|$|E
50|$|In {{continental}} Europe, <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> {{caused the}} Karneval festivities in Cologne {{and elsewhere in}} the Rhineland to be cut short. The St. Martin's Day procession was cancelled in Aachen and minor flooding and <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> occurred in various parts of Germany, but no one was injured.|$|R

50|$|At <b>high</b> altitudes <b>wind</b> {{is often}} strong and {{continuous}} over long periods. Consequently, wind in alpine regions imposes severe mechanical stress on plants. As a consequence, alpine species require strong root systems to maintain anchorage in the soil. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> {{also contribute to}} soil erosion by moving fine soil particles. These particles blown over the vegetation by <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> can effectively prune erect vegetation. Intense glazing winds occur in winter and late spring.|$|R
5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{associated}} convective activity was east {{of the center of}} circulation, Louisiana and Mississippi received minimal damage. However, on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Florida received <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding. The storm caused a total of about $20million (2002USD; $23.96million 2008USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Andres was {{the first}} named storm and {{hurricane}} of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Forming on June 21, Andres gradually intensified as it tracked along the Mexican coastline. Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and by June23, the storm attained hurricane-status, peaking with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Upon attaining this intensity, the storm featured a developing eyewall within a central dense overcast. Within 36hours, the storm rapidly degenerated, having most of the convection being displaced by <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> shear, becoming a non-tropical trough during the afternoon of June24.|$|E
