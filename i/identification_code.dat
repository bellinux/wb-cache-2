5|$|Bravo November is the {{original}} <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> painted on a British Royal Air Force Boeing Chinook HC4 military serial number ZA718. It was one of {{the original}} 30 aircraft ordered by the RAF in 1978 and has been in service ever since. It has been upgraded several times in its history, now being designated as an HC4 airframe. It has seen action in every major operation involving the RAF in the helicopter's 30-year service life. Since 1982 it has served in the Falkland Islands, Lebanon, Germany, Northern Ireland, Kurdistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. The aircraft has seen four of its pilots awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for actions whilst in command of Bravo November.|$|E

2500|$|Technologies {{related to}} {{shipping}} containers are <b>identification</b> <b>codes,</b> bar codes, and {{electronic data interchange}} (EDI). [...] These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions {{in the process of}} shipping containers throughout the distribution channel. [...] Each has an essential function: <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} {{is the total}} coverage even if collecting and processing represent low cost. It allows producing more detailed statistics than using surveys. Different registers can be combined and linked together {{on the basis of}} defined keys (personal <b>identification</b> <b>codes,</b> business <b>identification</b> <b>codes,</b> address codes etc.). Moreover, individual administrative registers are usually of high quality and very detailed.|$|R

25|$|PVC, LDPE, PP, and PS (see resin <b>identification</b> <b>code)</b> {{are also}} recyclable. These items are usually {{composed}} of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, it was {{estimated}} that 56 million tons of PET are produced each year. While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, PET bottle recycling is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET has a resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> of 1. The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester fiber, strapping, and non-food containers.|$|E

25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{drinking}} from polycarbonate bottles increased urinary bisphenolA levels by two thirds, from 1.2 μg/g creatinine to 2 μg/g creatinine. Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenolA avoid canned food and polycarbonate plastic containers (which shares resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> 7 with many other plastics) unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenolA-free. To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E
25|$|Rings {{large enough}} to carry numbers are usually {{restricted}} to larger birds, although if necessary small extensions to the rings (leg flags) bearing the <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> allow their use on slightly smaller species. For small species (e.g. most passerines), individuals can be identified by {{using a combination of}} small rings of different colours, which are read in a specific order. Most colour-marks of this type are considered temporary (the rings degrade, fade and may be lost or removed by the birds) and individuals are usually also fitted with a permanent metal ring.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{challenge to the}} recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it labor-intensive. Typically, workers sort the plastic {{by looking at the}} resin <b>identification</b> <b>code,</b> although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable, which presents additional problems for the sorting process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.|$|E

25|$|West Maximus {{was built}} in Seattle, Washington in 1918-19 at the No. 2 Plant of the Skinner & Eddy Corporation—the 20th {{in a series of}} 24 Design 1013 cargo ships built by the company for the United States Shipping Board's {{emergency}} wartime shipbuilding program. Initially intended for commission into the U.S. Navy as an auxiliary, West Maximus was assigned the navy <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> ID-3924, but the proposed commission was later withdrawn, probably because the war ended before the ship's completion. The ship was launched on 28 December 1918, about six weeks {{after the end of the}} war, and delivered to the USSB in April 1919.|$|E
25|$|Like SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M {{supports}} the SMPTE 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; {{it is used}} for things such as embedded audio, closed captions, timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word <b>identification</b> <b>code,</b> a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload.|$|E
25|$|Serving {{with the}} National Pigeon Service (NPS) during the Second World War, Commando {{had been given}} the <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> N.U.R.P.38.EGU.242. During his career, Commando made more than ninety trips into and out of German {{occupied}} France, carrying confidential messages. Messenger pigeons were carried into the war zones by British paratroopers, and released as needed with messages attached to fly home. He was noted for three particular missions carried out in 1942—one in June, another in August, and the third in September—in which he carried crucial intelligence to Britain from agents in France. This vital information included the location of German troops, industrial sites and injured British soldiers.|$|E
40|$|A {{new class}} of <b>codes,</b> called burst <b>identification</b> <b>codes,</b> is defined and studied. These codes {{can be used to}} {{determine}} the patterns of burst errors. Two-dimensional burst correcting codes can be easily constructed from burst <b>identification</b> <b>codes.</b> The resulting class of codes is simple to implement and has lower redundancy than other comparable codes. The results are pertinent to the study of radiation effects on VLSI RAM chips, which can cause two-dimensional bursts of error...|$|R

2500|$|Plastic {{packaging}} {{is split}} into seven broad classes for recycling purposes by a Plastic <b>identification</b> <b>code.</b> [...] As of 2014 {{there are no}} BPA labeling requirements for plastics in the US. [...] "In general, plastics that are marked with Resin Identification Codes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are very unlikely to contain BPA. Some, but not all, plastics that are marked with the Resin <b>Identification</b> <b>Code</b> 7 may be made with BPA." [...] Type 7 is the catch-all [...] "other" [...] class, and some type 7 plastics, such as polycarbonate (sometimes identified with the letters [...] "PC" [...] near the recycling symbol) and epoxy resins, are made from bisphenolA monomer. Type 3 (PVC) may contain bisphenolA as an antioxidant in [...] "flexible PVC" [...] softened by plasticizers, but not rigid PVC such as pipe, windows, and siding.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{detailed}} examination of <b>identification</b> <b>codes,</b> their embeddedness in everyday life, and how recent trends are qualitatively altering their nature and power. Developing a Foucaultian analysis we argue that <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> are key components of governmentality and capitalism. They provide a means of representing, collating, sorting, categorising, matching, profiling, regulating, of generating information, knowledge, and control through processes of abstraction, compu- tation, modeling, and classification. <b>Identification</b> <b>codes</b> now provide a means of uniquely addressing all the entities and processes that make up everyday life - people, material objects, information, transactions, and territories. Moreover, they provide a means of linking these entities and processes together in complex ways to form dense rhizomic assemblages of power/knowledge. At present, however, the information that <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> provide access to are, at best, oligopticon in nature - that is, they afford only partial and selective views. In {{the latter part of}} the paper we outline four trends - wide-scale trawling for data, increased granularity, forever storage, and enhanced processing and analysis - that seek to convert these partial oligopticons into more panoptic arrangements. In turn, we contend that these trends are part of a larger metatrend [...] the creation of a machine-readable world in which <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> can be systematically and automatically 'read' and acted on by software inde- pendent of human control. This metatrend is supported by interlocking discourses such as safety, security, efficiency, antifraud, citizenship and consumer empowerment, productivity, reliability, flexi- bility, economic rationality, and competitive advantage to construct powerful, supportive discursive regimes...|$|R
