2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2002, Deutsche Bahn {{undertook}} a major reform of its pricing strategy. The linear pricing model (where ticket prices were fixed and proportional to distance travelled) that had existed {{for over a century}} was partly replaced with a new model. Though the old fare system for standard tickets was kept largely unchanged, a degree of yield management was introduced for discounted tickets. As a part of this reform the <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> to Bahncard holders was reduced from 50% to 25%. The justification was that the Bahncard discount was now valid on top of the new saver fares (called Plan-und-Spar) that offered discounts of up to 40% on the standard fares but were only available under certain conditions (non-exchangeable; booking more than 3 days in advance; return journey required; [...] "weekeend rule"; limited number of seats).|$|E

50|$|A <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> to {{customers}} who are above a certain relatively advanced age, typically a round number such as 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75; the exact age varies in different cases. The rationale for a senior <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> by companies {{is that the}} customer {{is assumed to be}} retired and living on a limited income, and unlikely to be willing to pay full price; sales at reduced price are better than no sales. Non-commercial organizations may offer concessionary prices as a matter of social policy. Free or reduced-rate travel is often available to older people (see, for example, Freedom Pass).In United States most grocery stores offer senior discounts, starting for those age 50 or older, but most discounts are offered for those over 60.|$|E

50|$|The complex was {{the subject}} of {{significant}} controversy over the policies of a previous owner regarding rent control and deceptive pricing. Apartments were alleged to have been offered at low prices because of a significant <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> at lease signing. Upon expiration of the initial lease, rents could be raised by the maximum percentage allowed under San Francisco rent control laws, but calculating from the initial, not discounted, rent, leading in some cases to rental increases of 28%. The complex was sued in a class action lawsuit that was settled out of court. The current owners Parkmerced Investors, LLC, were not sued over this issue.|$|E

5000|$|Under earlier US state Fair Trade statutes, the {{manufacturer}} {{was able to}} impose a fixed price for items. The fixed prices could offer some price protection to small merchants in competition against larger retail organizations. These were determined to be in restraint of trade. Many manufacturers have adopted MSRP, a price at which {{the manufacturer}} suggests the item be priced by a retailer. The term [...] "suggested" [...] can be misleading because in many cases, the MSRP is extremely high compared to the actual wholesale cost, opening the market to [...] "deep discounters," [...] {{who are able to}} sell products substantially below the MSRP but still make a profit. The discount stores benefit from exorbitant MSRPs because the <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> increases the perceived value to customers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third season}} {{consisted}} of 22 episodes (four {{of which were}} produced during the second season) and initially ran from September to October 2008. During this brief run of seven episodes, ’Til Death aired Wednesdays at 9/8c alongside a new comedy Do Not Disturb. The ratings for both shows were low, and as a result, the network pulled the sitcom from its November schedule. [...] Despite not airing all of season three and low ratings, ’Til Death was renewed for a fourth season in January 2009. Fox confirmed at its upfront presentation in May that the new season would air on Friday nights in the fall. The surprise renewal was attributed to a significant licensing <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> to Fox by the production company of ’Til Death (Sony Pictures Television), because it needed one more season to make the program viable for syndication.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{businesses}} which run {{contracts with}} daily deal websites consider doing so {{as a marketing}} activity rather than a direct means of generating profit. Between the deep <b>discount</b> <b>offered</b> {{as part of the}} deal and the payout to the deal-of-the-day site, the businesses may net little or no profit (effectively making the deals loss leaders). There is evidence that these businesses gain significant increases in overall sales due to the amount of exposure gained from running a one-day deal. Many customers who purchase daily deals are [...] "price-sensitive deal-seekers" [...] who are unlikely to return to the business in the future without similar discounts. However, studies have shown that for small businesses and start-ups, daily deals can result in a substantial 30% increase in profits. A survey of businesses who ran daily deals in the past year revealed that more than half (55.5%) profited on their daily deal promotion, whereas just over a quarter (26.6%) lost money. The remainder (17.9%) broke even. Beyond mere exposure, these businesses hope to capitalize on the long-term value of new repeat customers. Thus deal-of-the-day sites also function as marketing platforms.|$|E
