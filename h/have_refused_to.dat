5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense.

5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers <b>have</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E

5|$|Both fighters' {{victories}} on April 12 {{cleared the}} way for a July 26 showdown between Cotto and Margarito. The WBA welterweight title fight took place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, marking the first time Cotto headlined a Las Vegas card. It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 11, 2004, on the undercard of Vitali Klitschko's bout with Danny Williams. According to Bob Arum, the match took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. The Las Vegas notion gained momentum in the previous month when the Nevada Athletic Commission amended its provisional rules on glove size, allowing welterweights to wear 8ounce (227g) gloves instead of the previously mandated 10ounce (284g) gloves. Nearly every other boxing jurisdiction in the United States allows welterweights to fight with 8ounce gloves, and both Cotto and Margarito likely would <b>have</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> fight in Las Vegas without their usual glove size. Margarito had to vacate the IBF welterweight title after the IBF mandated him to defend the title against Joshua Clottey. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 13 September 1810 was an {{inconclusive}} frigate engagement {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates during which a British frigate {{was defeated by}} two French vessels near Isle de France (now Mauritius), but British reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the French could secure her. The British frigate was HMS Africaine, a new arrival to the Indian Ocean. She was {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Corbet, who had served there the previous year. Corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in Britain over claims that Corbet had either committed suicide at the shame of losing his ship, been murdered by his disaffected crew, or been abandoned by his men, who were said to <b>have</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> load their guns while he remained in command. Whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined, but the issue has been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to <b>have</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E
