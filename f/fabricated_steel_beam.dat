40|$|Graduation date: 1966 <b>Fabricated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>beam</b> {{specimens}} with rectangular holes cut in {{the webs}} were subjected to load tests to analyze {{the behavior of the}} modified section. Beam-depth to hole-depth ratio was in all cases 2. 0; however, ratio of hole length to hole height varied from 2. 0 to 3. 0. The primary instrumentation of electrical resistance strain gages was located at ratios of nominal bending moment to shear for the solid section of 40 and 64. Instrumentation was located with regard to flexural behavior in the tee-sections, rather than the determination of stress concentrations near the hole corners. The approximate Vierendeel method, although not new, is developed for the analysis of beams with web holes; such beams are commonly called Vierendeel beams. Also included is a more precise development of the Vierendeel analogy by matrix analysis techniques. Experimental strain results are correlated with predictions by both the approximate Vierendeel analysis, which is currently used for design analysis, and by the actual Vierendeel analysis. Experimental deflection results are correlated with deflection predictions by the actual Vierendeel analysis. Predictions by the theory of elasticity method are discussed, but due to the complexities of the solution, comparisons with the experimental results are not presented. Tests in which the beam specimens were loaded to failure were conducted to study the type of failure when web material is removed. Failure was a form of lateral instability before the desired failure mode was obtained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal design of <b>fabricated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> for long-span portal frames. The design optimisation {{takes into account}} ultimate as well as serviceability limit states, adopting deflection limits recommended by the Steel Construction Institute (SCI). Results for three benchmark frames demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} optimisation methodology. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimise the dimensions of the plates used for the columns, rafters and haunches. Discrete decision variables were adopted for the thickness of the steel plates and continuous variables for the breadth and depth of the plates. Strategies were developed to enhance the performance of the GA including solution space reduction and a hybrid initial population half of which is derived using Latin hypercube sampling. The results show that the proposed GA-based optimisation model generates optimal and near-optimal solutions consistently. A parametric study is then conducted on frames of different spans. A significant variation in weight between fabricated and conventional hot-rolled steel portal frames is shown; for a 50 m span frame, a 14 – 19 % saving in weight was achieved. Furthermore, since Universal Beam sections in the UK come from a discrete section library, the results could also provide overall dimensions of other beams that could be more efficient for portal frames. Eurocode 3 was used for illustrative purposes; any alternative code of practice may be used...|$|R

Test of two {{specimens}} (four different joints) of <b>steel</b> secondary <b>beam</b> {{embedded in}} reinforced concrete girder in frame structure and one specimen with <b>steel</b> cantilever <b>beam</b> embedded in reinforced concrete girder under static load were conducted. The <b>steel</b> <b>beam</b> up-flange was pulled {{out because of}} the concrete cracks caused by the moment, shear and torsion at the upper zone of the concrete <b>beam</b> near the <b>steel</b> <b>beam</b> end. Shear failure of the concrete beam and the top flange pullout failure are the most hazardous failure modes. Lacking restraint of concrete and the reinforcement of steel bar in the concrete slab and catenary action of restraint <b>steel</b> <b>beam,</b> the capacity of <b>steel</b> cantilever <b>beam</b> is much smaller than other beams. Load-slip curve of top flange of <b>steel</b> <b>beam,</b> load-rotation curve of the <b>steel</b> <b>beam</b> end are obtained through experiment.

Analytical results of ABAQUS are shown as follows.

40|$|In this paper, the {{behaviors}} of 14 H-section <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> in fire are investigated. The test is carried out by use of the self-made fire-test furnace. The lengths of beams are 4200 mm and 3600 mm. The temperature field and deflection of beams in fire are measured. The effect of connection, boundary condition and axial restraint on {{the behaviors}} of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> is also studied. The test indicates that local buckling and lateral torsional buckling of H-section <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> occur in fire. The behaviors of H-section <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> in fire are influenced by connection and axial restraint. When the beams undergo a large deflection, compression force then quickly changes into tension force, which supports the beam and reduces further deflection, and the catenary action takes place.

40|$|Light gauge cold-formed steel {{sections}} {{have been}} developed as more economical building solutions to the alternative heavier hot-rolled sections in the commercial and residential markets. Cold-formed lipped channel beams (LCB), LiteSteel beams (LSB) and triangular hollow flange beams (THFB) are commonly used as flexural members such as floor joists and bearers while rectangular hollow flange beams (RHFB) are used in small scale housing developments through to large building structures. However, their shear capacities are determined based on conservative design rules. For the shear design of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>beams,</b> their elastic shear buckling strength and the potential post-buckling strength must be determined accurately. Hence experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LCBs, LSBs, THFBs and RHFBs. Improved shear design rules including the direct strength method (DSM) based design equations were developed to determine the ultimate shear capacities of these open and hollow flange <b>steel</b> <b>beams.</b> An improved equation for the higher elastic shear buckling coefficient of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> was proposed based on finite element analysis results and included in the design equations.

40|$|Reduced {{beam section}} (RBS) {{is one of}} the {{connection}} types, which is economical and popular for use in steel moment frames in seismic regions. By cutting some portions of the beam flanges near the column face, the RBS connections are designed to form plastic hinge within the RBS zone so that it could enhance the structural seismic performance. However, the <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with RBS connections have to provide robustness when exposed to fire. Although the responses of ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> to elevated temperatures have been investigated over the last few decades, there has been very limited research on the behaviour of <b>steel</b> <b>beams,</b> with RBS connections in fire. This study includes a series of numerical analysis, to investigate the high-temperature performance of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with RBS connections, compared to the responses of ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> to fire. Various parameters have been considered, including the types of fire curves, the levels of beam-end restraints and the cutting profiles of the RBS connections. Overall, the deformation shape of RBS beams at high temperature {{is similar to that of}} ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>beams,</b> whereas the RBS beams could have longer period of fire resistance. The cut section actually provides both rotational and axial ductility/deformability to the connection, enhancing its fire resistance. Moreover, the cutting length, proposed by EC 8, is also adequate for fire design. The minimum distance, between the RBS zone and the beam-end, proposed by FEMA- 350 has been shown sufficient...|$|R

The current design method is examined in detail with plastic hinges formed at the low moment side (LMS) and the high moment side (HMS) of the web openings separately. A finite element model is then established with both material and geometrical non-linearity so that load redistribution across the web openings may be incorporated. Moreover, the moment capacities of the tee-sections above and below the web openings may be properly evaluated in the presence of co-existing axial and shear forces in the finite element model. The load carrying capacities of typical universal <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with circular web openings are also presented and discussed. An empirical shear moment interaction curve at the perforated sections is also suggested for practical design of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with circular web openings against the Vierendeel mechanism.
