25|$|The {{relations}} between the Kriegsmarine had <b>hardly</b> <b>been</b> improved with the failure of Rheinübung. Since 1937 Göring and the Luftwaffe had thwarted any attempt by the navy to produce a naval air arm. Not only did the Luftwaffe maintain control over all aspects of aviation, the naval commanders, like Raeder and Dönitz had to rely, on Göring's good will to receive support. In order to have air support, the highest authorities in both services had to consult {{on the use of}} units. Even if the negotiations were devoid of friction, it was inflexible and inefficient system.|$|E

Some of these were simply matters of presentation and did not affect content. However, responding {{to the view that}} the requirements of some breed standards were potentially detrimental to the health or well-being of the animal, changes have been made affecting the required eye shape and the loose skin, the most recent revision being 2008-9.|$|E

German troops passed through the village in late September 1914 during the First Battle of Albert, {{part of a series}} of reciprocal operations by the German and Franco-British armies, to advance round the northern flank of their opponent during the operations known as the Race to the Sea. The village became a backwater until 1916 when a third line of defence was dug behind the Somme front, as part of the German preparations to receive the British-French offensive being prepared on the Somme.|$|E

25|$|The 1993 Swiss {{documentary}} Helden vom Himmel first {{mentioned that}} dark chapter of Swiss history. On 27 October 2015 the Swiss television channel Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen SRF broadcast Wauwilermoos: Kriegsgefangene im Luzerner Mittelland, {{and one day}} later the Swiss documentary film Erzwungene Landung respectively Notlandung (Forced Landing) by Daniel Wyss. Thus far, the fates of the internees in Wauwilermoos were widely unknown to the public. In publications on Swiss history, the internment in Wauwilermoos has <b>hardly</b> <b>been</b> explored in depth. In reports, Wauwilermoos is very rarely mentioned, and the Swiss politics has hardly taken care, except to the 1944 interpellation from M. Brawand, and the reports by two Swiss newspapers in 1944 and 1946. Nevertheless, the contemporary films do not mention Wauwilermoos; about the prison camp there were mostly rumors. Daniel Wyss, the director learned {{in the same way}} from the penal camp, contacted Major Dwight Mears, participated in the ceremony in April 2014 in Washington D.C., and met the eight survivors of the camp.|$|E

[...] It concludes that unless greater efforts are made to highlight awareness of the Optional Protocol and build trust in the rulings of the Committee, the complaints mechanism will remain under-utilized.|$|E
500|$|Overall {{attitudes in}} Britain towards South African cricket {{began to change}} in the 1960s. At the time, race was {{becoming}} a more emotive matter in Britain and immigration from Asia and the Caribbean became an issue in general elections. Racial tensions had risen throughout the 1950s, and race riots had occurred. Tim Quelch, in his review of English cricket in the 1950s, suggests that [...] " [...] record on race relations had <b>hardly</b> <b>been</b> exemplary". But Jack Williams, in his book Cricket and Race, suggests that cricket was a force for racial harmony in England given the influx of African-Caribbean and Asian overseas players and the mingling of white and African-Caribbean supporters during several Test series between England and the West Indies. Against this background, when the South African team toured England in 1960, there were some protests against apartheid.|$|E

By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, {{reflecting}} a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career {{brought them to the}} attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could [...] "have <b>hardly</b> <b>been</b> more supportive". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, [...] "their master piece to date", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Makers Colin Irwin said it was [...] "incredibly exciting and utterly compelling". [...] A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was [...] "meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music." ...|$|E
500|$|More {{trouble with}} the {{legislature}} struck Greenfield in August 1922, during a special session called {{for the purpose of}} passing enabling legislation for a provincial wheat board. [...] The session lasted only a week, and on August 31 the only item of business that remained was the members' pay for the session. [...] The government was proposing $100 per member, but some MLAs complained that this was insufficient in light of the long travel times between Edmonton and their constituencies. [...] Greenfield, lacking the counsel of the vacationing Brownlee and wanting to avoid trouble, proposed upping the amount to $200. [...] Independent MLA Robert Pearson proposed increasing it once again, to $250, to match what their counterparts in Saskatchewan had received. [...] This suggestion was carried. [...] While Greenfield had <b>hardly</b> <b>been</b> {{the driving force behind the}} increases, he had facilitated them and had been blind to the appearance of paying MLAs more for six afternoons of work than some farmers were able to earn in a year. [...] The grassroots of his own party condemned the move, all the more so when the wheat board that had been the purpose of the special session failed to come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|On January 10, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{recordings}} for RCA in Nashville. Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including first tenor Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, {{to fill out the}} sound. The session produced the moody, unusual [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27. Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance, on January 28, introduced by disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem [...] "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's [...] "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, {{reached the top of the}} Billboard country chart. Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager. Gladys Presley was worried about how the fans were reacting to Presley and had <b>hardly</b> <b>been</b> to any of her son's performances because she was worried he was going to get hurt, she remarked to him repeatedly: [...] "Elvis, the Colonel is going to work you to your death.
