5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
500|$|This episode marked Chris Carter's {{directing}} debut. Being {{the first}} he had ever directed, David Nutter from the directing staff helped, tipped, and showed <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> With Nutter's help, Carter learned how to block entire scenes. When commenting on his experience, Carter told that he sometimes followed Nutter's advice down to [...] "the letter". When directing the episode, Carter {{wanted to create a}} different feel for the episode, by focusing more on the performances given by the actors, than the mechanical set designs. Carter declared that directing he learned about [...] "things you take for granted as a writer and producer", that lead to [...] "compromises" [...] for things Carter could not do on-screen, and compared the episode to a stage play as most is set in a single place, the travel agency.|$|E
500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E

Delano expected Miller to feed ammunition to one gun, but his attention was diverted, and when he looked again, Miller was firing one of the guns. White had loaded ammunition into both guns and assigned Miller the starboard gun.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day do you work, {{and what do you}} write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E
2500|$|Sheridan jumped {{his horse}} over the berm and landed among Confederates who had thrown down {{their weapons and}} were waiting to surrender. When they asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Sheridan pointed to the rear and said: [...] "Go over there. Get right along, now. Drop your guns; youll never need them any more. You'll be safe over there. Are there any more of you? We want every one of your fellows." [...] Ayres had taken {{the key to the}} entire Confederate line, over 1,000 prisoners and eight battle flags but among the Union {{casualties}} was Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Frederick Winthrop who was mortally wounded and Colonel Richard N. Bowerman who was severely wounded. Colonel James Grindley assumed command of Winthrop's brigade while Colonel David L. Stanton took charge of Bowerman's brigade.|$|E
2500|$|Mix {{reportedly}} did {{not have}} to train Tony, but simply show <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for each feat. Mix could convey any sort of message to the pony by touches of the hand or fingers on Tony's neck. [...] Although there is speculation that whips, strong bits, and spurs were used. Such stunts included untying Mix’s hands, opening gates,jumping over high fences, getting tangled in ropes, loosening his reins, rescuing Mix from fire, jumping from one cliff to another, and running after trains. In the 1926 film The Great K & A Train Robbery (Fox Film Corporation), Mix jumps Tony through a glass window into a building and rides him alongside a speeding train. In the film Trailin (Fox Film Corporation, 1921) Mix and Tony have a bridge slashed from under them, and uncut footage shows the pair tipping over to the river below.|$|E

Then Bill Black picked up his bass and began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, and stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up. Try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again'. So we kinda talked it over and figured out a little bit what we were doin'. We ran it again, and of course Sam is listenin'. 'Bout the third or fourth time through, we just cut it. It was basically a rhythm record. It wasn't any great thing. It wasn't Sam tellin' <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Elvis was joking around, just doing what come naturally, what he felt.|$|E
2500|$|When {{she first}} {{looked at a}} student's score, she often commented on its {{relation}} {{to the work of}} a variety of composers: [...] "hese measures have the same harmonic progressions as Bach's F major prelude and Chopin's F major Ballade. Can you not come up with something more interesting?" [...] Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: [...] "Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory." [...] Copland recalled that [...] "she had but one all-embracing principle...the creation of what she called la grande ligne - the long line in music." [...] She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: [...] "When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious." [...] She said, [...] "You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself. It's always necessary to be yourself – that is a mark of genius in itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|And {{they come}} into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, [...] "Son of David, have mercy on me." [...] But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and {{straightway}} a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from {{the door of the}} tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned {{to the other side of}} the Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|A {{psychiatrist}} testimony followed. While Dahlgren {{remained silent}} when questioned by police, he had {{cooperated with the}} psychiatrist who commented that she had spent several times more time analyzing Dahlgren than any other person before. According to her, Dahlgren suffered by mixed personality disorder, however not {{to the extent to}} be declared mentally ill during the murders. [...] He had had a sexual relationship with male classmate during his time at high school, with sexual relationships with women afterwards. Dahlgren had claimed to like animals more than people. Before going to Brno, Dahlgren was contemplating going to Africa instead in order to kill poachers there. In Brno, he first felt fine, however later Mr. Harok Sr. started asking him to find a meaningful occupation, which meant {{that he was in the}} same position as back in the US. During repeated interviews with psychiatrist, Dahlgren had spoken about his [...] "internal voice" [...] that tells <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "in order to become a hero". This, however, did not reach a state of psychosis: according to the psychiatrist a person in the state of psychosis would not be able to conduct the murders the manner they happened (over several hours, with bodies being dragged to the garage, covered, and with an attempt to burn the house). Defense attorney attacked the psychiatrist claiming that American specialists found that he is suffering from bipolar-type schizoaffective disorder. The psychiatrist refused that saying that she had spent more time with Dahlgren, collected much more data, and that also that Dahlgren had shown no symptoms of such disorder during his long-term pre-trial custody.|$|E
