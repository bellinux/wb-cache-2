25|$|Bristol Harbour {{still has}} a working system, the pumping {{machinery}} of which was supplied by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, Scotland in 1907. The engine house is a grade II* listed building, constructed in 1887,fully commissioned by 1888, with a tower at one end to house the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator.</b> A second accumulator was fitted outside the building (dated 1954) which enables {{the operation of the}} system to be more easily visualised.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of the canal entrance, behind a viaduct arch is the {{octagonal}} tower of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator,</b> 1869, replacing an earlier and pioneering structure dating from the 1850s by William George Armstrong, engineer and inventor. This regulated the hydraulic pressure of the extensive network of hydraulic mains around the basin supplying the coal-handling machinery. The associated steam raising plant and hydraulic pumps have been removed. The building was converted by Dransfield Owens de Silva for the London Docklands Development Corporation to function as a viewing platform. It (and the basin itself) is now owned by the British Waterways Board; and is a Grade II listed building, and is open every year during Open House Weekend, usually the third weekend in September.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator.</b> Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The accumulator was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|E
50|$|Short-term storage was {{provided}} by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators,</b> which were large vertical pistons loaded with heavy weights.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{accumulators}} include steam accumulators, mainsprings, flywheel energy storage, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators,</b> rechargeable batteries, capacitors, compensated pulsed alternators (compulsators), and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants.|$|R

25|$|The idea of {{a public}} {{hydraulic}} power network was suggested by Joseph Bramah in a patent obtained in 1812. William Armstrong began installing systems in England from the 1840s, using low-pressure water, but a breakthrough occurred in 1850 {{with the introduction of}} the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator,</b> which allowed much higher pressures to be used. The first public network, supplying many companies, was constructed in Kingston upon Hull, England. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company began operation in 1877, with Edward B. Ellington as its engineer. Ellington was involved in most of the British networks, and some further afield. Public networks were constructed in Britain at London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. There were similar networks in Antwerp, Melbourne, Sydney, Buenos Aires and Geneva. All of the public networks had ceased to operate by the mid-1970s, but Bristol Harbour still has an operational system, with an accumulator situated outside the main pumphouse, enabling its operation to be easily visualised.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hydraulic}} power still used {{to move the}} bridge is today derived from electrically driven pumps. These feed a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator</b> sunk into a [...] shaft below the bridge; the water is then released under pressure which runs the machinery to turn the bridge. The mechanism used for this {{is still the same}} machinery originally installed by Armstrong.|$|E
2500|$|The tower {{houses a}} raised weight <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> <b>accumulator</b> which stores the hydraulic energy ensuring a smooth delivery of pressure and {{meaning that the}} pumps {{do not need to}} be running the whole time nor be [...] "over-specified" [...] in order to satisfy peak demand. The external accumulator was added in 1954. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps. The working pressure is 750 lbf/inÂ² (5.2 MPa).|$|E

50|$|The London Tower Bridge is {{operated}} via an accumulator. The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators.</b> In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely {{replaced by a}} new electro-hydraulic drive system.|$|R
2500|$|While the Newcastle system ran {{on water}} from the public water supply, the crane {{installed}} by Armstrong at Burntisland was not located where such an option was possible, and so he built a [...] tower, with a water tank at the top, which was filled by a [...] steam engine. At Elswick in Glasgow, charges by the Corporation Water Department for the water used persuaded the owners {{that the use of}} a steam-powered crane would be cheaper. Bramah's concept of [...] "loaded pistons" [...] was introduced in 1850, when the first <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator</b> was installed as part of a scheme for cranes for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. A scheme for cranes at Paddington the following year specified an accumulator with a [...] piston and a stroke of , which enabled pressures of [...] to be achieved. Compared to the [...] of the Newcastle scheme, this increased pressure significantly reduced the volumes of water used. Cranes were not the only application, and hydraulic operation of the dock gates at Swansea reduced the operating time from 15 to two minutes, and the number of men required to operate them from twelve to four. Each of these schemes was for a single customer, and the application of hydraulic power more generally required a new model.|$|E

40|$|In mobile {{hydraulics}} double acting, two chamber, asymmetrical {{hydraulic cylinders}} {{are commonly used}} for linear motion control. This paper shows how a cylinder instead using four chambers can improve fuel efficiency in construction machinery. In addition to this special multi-chamber cylinder the hydraulic systems presented in this study {{involves the use of}} discretely controlled on/off valves, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators</b> and secondary controlled hydraulic motors. The proposed system solution supports potential and kinetic energy recovery and storage using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators.</b> Through proper sizing of compon- ents and sophisticated control of simple on/off valves an energy efficient, flexible and robust system is achieved. This paper outlines the basics behind this concept and provides some examples as to how the technology can be useful with an ambition to reach new levels of energy efficiency in construction machines...|$|R

50|$|The {{heart of}} the system is several (usually eight) {{powerful}} hydraulic pumps, each capable of producing around 500 horsepower (373 kW). Hydraulic fluid is pumped into several different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators</b> (energy storing devices) containing two compartments separated by a piston.

25|$|The Elswick works {{continued}} to prosper, and by 1870 it stretched for {{three-quarters of a}} mile along the riverside. The population of Elswick, which was 3,539 in 1851, had increased by 1871 to 27,800. In 1894, Elswick built and installed the steam-driven pumping engines, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulators</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> pumping engines to operate Londonâs Tower Bridge.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicle uses hydraulic and mechanical components instead of electrical. A {{variable displacement pump}} replaces the electric motor/generator. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator</b> stores energy. The vessel typically carries a flexible bladder of pre-charged pressurized nitrogen gas. Pumped hydraulic fluid is compressed against the bladder storing the energy in the compressed nitrogen gas. Some versions have a piston in a cylinder rather than a pressurized bladder. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>accumulator</b> is potentially cheaper and more durable than batteries. Hydraulic hybrid technology was originally implemented in Germany in the 1930s.
