50|$|Optical {{proximity}} correction (OPC) is a photolithography enhancement technique {{commonly used}} to compensate for image errors due to diffraction or process effects. The need for OPC is seen mainly {{in the making of}} semiconductor devices and is due to the limitations of light to maintain the edge placement integrity of the original design, after processing, into the <b>etched</b> <b>image</b> on the silicon wafer. These projected images appear with irregularities such as line widths that are narrower or wider than designed, these are amenable to compensation by changing the pattern on the photomask used for imaging. Other distortions such as rounded corners are driven by the resolution of the optical imaging tool and are harder to compensate for. Such distortions, if not corrected for, may significantly alter the electrical properties of what was being fabricated. Optical proximity correction corrects these errors by moving edges or adding extra polygons to the pattern written on the photomask. This may be driven by pre-computed look-up tables based on width and spacing between features (known as rule based OPC) or by using compact models to dynamically simulate the final pattern and thereby drive the movement of edges, typically broken into sections, to find the best solution, (this is known as model based OPC). The objective is to reproduce in the silicon wafer, as well as possible, the original layout drawn by the designer.|$|E
5000|$|Confusingly, the printmaking {{technique}} used in steel engravings is, after the earliest {{years in the}} 1820s, normally a combination of etching and true engraving, with etching becoming dominant in later examples, after the technique became popular in the 1830s. Engraving is done with a burin, which is a small bar of hardened steel with a sharp point. It is pushed along the plate to produce thin furrowed lines, leaving [...] "burr" [...] or strips of waste metal to the side. This {{is followed by the}} use of a scraper to remove any burs, since they would be an impediment during the subsequent inking process. Steel plates are very hard for this technique, which is normally used on softer copper plates. So steel engraving also used etching (q.v.), where acid creates the lines in the plates in the pattern made by selectively removing a thin coating of acid-resistant ground by tools. This is much less effort. As well as etching needles, the etched part of steel engravings made great use of roulettes, small wheels mounted in handles which have regular sharp projections which produce broken lines of dots and dashes when rolled across the plate. Roulettes of different types were used together with the burin and needle to create densely packed marks which appear as tonal to the eye, and allow a great variety of textures and effects. True burin engraving was generally used to finish the <b>etched</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{applying}} photographic resists to otherwise incompatible substrates, {{such as a}} baking enamel paint surface, is described wherein the uncured enamel paint surface is coated with a non-curing lacquer which is, in turn, coated with a partially cured lacquer. The non-curing lacquer adheres to the enamel and a photo resist material satisfactorily adheres to the partially cured lacquer. Once normal photo etching techniques are employed the lacquer coats can be easily removed from the enamel leaving the photo <b>etched</b> <b>image.</b> In the case of edge lighted instrument panels, a coat of uncured enamel is placed over the cured enamel followed by the lacquer coats and the photo resists which is exposed and developed. Once the etched uncured enamel is cured, the lacquer coats are removed leaving an etched panel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The dynamic damage {{resistance}} of two grades of very clean tantalum is compared. The materials were loaded to incipient failure using an 80 mm gas gun equipped with soft recovery using a parallel flyer plate experimental configwation. Both loading time and applied shock pressure was varied from 1. 1 - 2 ps and 5. 6 - 9. 8 GPa, respectively. A VISAR recorded the back surface velocity. The recovered samples were metallographically sectioned, polished, and <b>etched.</b> <b>Image</b> analysis and optical profilomeay quantified the resulting damage. Longitudinal porosity distributions {{of the tests}} are compared. A calibrated hydrocode based damage model was used to simulate the tests. We compare predicted and experimental measurements of free surface velocity and porosity. The model also produced free surface pullback signals suggesting high spall strength with little evolved porosity. This is further confirmation that in clean, high Peierls energy materials the VISAR pullback signal {{is associated with the}} creation of a region of enormous hydrostatic tensile stresses in the material, but is relatively distinct from the void coalescence process. A transition in coalescence mechanism, from primarily void growth impingement to long-range plastic instabilities, occurs with increasing hydrostatic tension and increasing stress pulse duration. 1...|$|E
30|$|The main {{principles}} and {{processes of the}} path centerline measurement algorithm are as follows: 3 [*]√ó[*] 3 square structure elements are selected, the image is etched, and the <b>etched</b> <b>image</b> is subtracted from the original image to get Edge_Road. Then, a zero-matrix CenterR {{of the same size}} as the original image is created, and a column vector with the number of the CenterR is constructed. The column vector is compared with the column vector in the image from the left side. The path is all labeled 1 and the environment is all labeled as 0. Therefore, if Edge_Road is not equal to 1, the algorithm continues to advance to the right for comparison. When Edge_Road is equal to 1, it indicates that the left edge position of the path is detected, and the coordinates are located, denoted as P 1. Then, the position detection of the right edge is performed, and the detection method is similar to the left edge detection. The difference is that the initial detection starts from the right side of the image, and when the pixel is detected to be 1, the detection is stopped, that is, the right edge position of the path is recorded as P 2. When the left and right edge positions have been determined, then the position of the left and right edge position coordinates and the position of one half are the position coordinate of the path center line. Finally, the pixel value at this coordinate is assigned a value of 1, the other pixels are marked as 0, and the final result is obtained.|$|E
5000|$|Printing {{the plate}} {{is done by}} {{covering}} the surface with printing ink, then rubbing the ink off the surface with tarlatan cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper {{is placed on the}} plate, and both are run through a printing press; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (c.f., chine-coll√©). Unfortunately, the pressure also subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a copper plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly <b>etched</b> <b>imaged</b> before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be electro-plated before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. Zinc is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.|$|R

40|$|Anatomy is a self depiction, {{a series}} of body images {{in the manner of}} self portraits, created without {{recourse}} to a mirror image. The work comprises largescale coloured etchings, which are assemblages of body prints and collaged 'found' anatomical drawings. The symbolism refers to the pre-Oedipal relation. This issue is met in Julia Kristeva's discussion of the semiotic chora, Luce Irigaray's discussion of Merleau-Ponty's analysis of vision, and other sources that I have referred to which reconsider the Lacanian narrative in psychoanalysis. Much of the debate about women's place in the symbolic realm has been conducted at the level of language. Anatomy contributes a visual parallel: a move to subvert the symbolic centrality of the female body as a passive plane or surface upon which meanings are projected, and to reconfigure a body image which acts as an active signifying entity. The pictorial solution that I arrived at utilises back-lighting to activate the body images, adding a visceral, immediate, and deliberately auratic element to the <b>etched</b> <b>images.</b> The illumination notionally returns the viewer's gaze and creates an intimacy - something like a caress - which alludes to the pre-Oedipal maternal gaze...|$|R

50|$|Gum arabic is {{also used}} to protect and <b>etch</b> an <b>image</b> in lithographic processes, both from {{traditional}} stones and aluminum plates. In lithography, gum by itself may be used to etch very light tones, such as those made with a number five crayon. Phosphoric, nitric or tannic acid is added in varying concentrations to the acacia gum to etch the darker tones up to dark blacks. The etching process creates a gum adsorb layer within the matrix that attracts water, ensuring that the oil based ink does not stick to those areas. Gum is also essential to what is sometimes called paper lithography, printing from an image created by a laser printer or photocopier.|$|R
