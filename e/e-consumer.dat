Focus was aimed toward the tri-sectors' perceptions of six roles of consumer organizations during the <b>e-consumer</b> protection e-governance process. Victoria, Australia was used as a working example. Results suggest that the governance process for e-commerce in Victoria may be compromised due to the lack of overall agreement among the three governance sectors about the role of consumer associations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to examine how consumers perceptually organize the risks {{that are associated with}} business-to-consumer (B 2 C) buying and selling of goods and services through the Internet. Prior studies did not focus on risk per se, but dealt mainly with the impact of the risks on eCommerce adoption. The existing studies assumed that the dimensions on which risks are rated are obvious to the respondents. However, electronic (eCommerce) related risks are new to the typical consumer, so, it is not yet known how consumers judge the risks. The Schema Theory states that people use generic concepts, schemata (mental structures), to organize risk perceptions in their memory. In this research, it is assumed that consumers have a schema for risk unto which online risks are embedded. Using the psychometric paradigm, respondents were asked to judge the riskiness of various risk objects in a pair-wise fashion using a similarity/dissimilarity scale, e. g., how dissimilar is Risk-object I to Risk-object 2 on a scale of I to 7 ? The collected data were analyzed using a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) technique to infer the set of dimensions across which respondents evaluate risks. The data collection method and analysis aided in answering two research questions: a) the dimensions consumers use when they judge online risks, and, b) how risk perceptions differ across customers from two countries. The study found that consumers employ a fine-grained schema to distinguish and group risks in their minds, characterize risks with more than two dimensions, and that none of the dimensions can be interpreted as pure probability or pure value. Analysis suggests that in judging online risks, subjects use three dimensions in general: familiar versus unfamiliar risk, known versus unknown, eVendor-trustieVendor distrust. Analysis suggests that differences exist in how U. S. and Nigerian subjects view online risks. For instance, on a ratio of 4 to I, the average U. S. <b>e-consumer</b> considered eVendor risk a major issue than the average Nigerian <b>e-consumer.</b> On the other hand, the average Nigerian <b>e-consumer</b> judged familiarity with the eCommerce risk of a major concern on a ratio of 4 to 2 than the average U.

40|$|In {{traditional}} commercial transactions, {{consumers are}} usually {{regarded as the}} vulnerable party. 1 This vulnerability is, arguably, more pronounced in e-commerce due to the way this particular kind of business is conducted, and this creates additional complications that do not exist in a traditional trade transaction. <b>E-consumer</b> concerns can be reduced by creating an appropriate legal environment, including the introduction of consumer protection regulations. Most developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, have realised that empowering consumers is important for fostering the e-commerce market. 2 However, in developing countries, the lack of consumer protection regulations for e-commerce {{is one of the}} main barriers to the progression of e-commerce. Saudi Arabia is one country affected by a lack of efficient protection for e-consumers. 3 This lack of efficiency is attributed to the ambiguity of current measures available for protecting e-consumers; current measures are based on basic consumer protection principles gleaned from Sharia and some other standard regulations that are used for protecting e-consumers. In the context of e-commerce, these general rules require further explanation and clarification. 4 Therefore, the overriding objective of this research is to address the need for <b>e-consumer</b> protection regulations in Saudi Arabia by proposing a legal framework that might be used to provide efficient protection. This research identifies areas that contribute to the ambiguity of current measures, including a lack of clear unified regulations for <b>e-consumer</b> protection, and a lack of clear provisions in specific areas including: information obligation, the right to cancel, and rights of redress. In order to address these needs, a legal framework is suggested.
