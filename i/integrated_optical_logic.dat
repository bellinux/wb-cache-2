40|$|Although gigahertz-scale free-carrier {{modulators}} {{have been}} demonstrated in silicon, intensity modulators operating at terahertz speeds have not been reported because of silicon's weak ultrafast nonlinearity. We have demonstrated intensity modulation of light with light in a silicon–polymer waveguide device, based on the all-optical Kerr effect—the ultrafast effect used in four-wave mixing. Direct measurements of time-domain intensity modulation are made at speeds of 10 GHz. We showed experimentally that the mechanism of this modulation is ultrafast through spectral measurements, and that intensity modulation at frequencies in excess of 1 THz can be obtained. By <b>integrating</b> <b>optical</b> polymers through evanescent coupling to silicon waveguides, we greatly increase the effective nonlinearity of the waveguide, allowing operation at continuous-wave power levels compatible with telecommunication systems.

By leveraging the processes and systems developed for electronics fabrication, {{it is possible}} to make highly repeatable devices where complexity can be scaled up through the use of wafer-scale batch fabrication. Because the mode concentration in silicon waveguides is two orders of magnitude higher than in fibers, {{it is possible to}} construct very compact nonlinear optical devices within this system, enabling the miniaturization and integration of ultrafast nonlinear devices. We have developed a library of devices, including both dielectric and plasmonic waveguides, as well as resonators, splitters, {{and a variety of other}} basic optical components. Using these components to construct integrated devices of moderate complexity, we have demonstrated Pockels’ Effect-based ring modulators, optical rectification-based detectors, four-wave mixing devices, and ultrafast intensity modulators, which operate at speeds in excess of 2 Terahertz. By <b>integrating</b> <b>optical</b> polymers through evanescent coupling to high-mode-confinement silicon waveguides, the effective nonlinearity of the waveguides can be greatly increased. The combination of high mode confinement, multiple <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> components, and high nonlinearity produces all-optical ultrafast devices operating at power levels compatible with modern continuous-wave telecommunication systems.

[...] Texto en inglés, prefacio en castellano. [...] Fecha de lectura: 19 - 07 - 2007. We {{study the}} {{influence}} of spontaneous emission noise in a two-mode model for semiconductor ring lasers, biased in the bidirectional static emission regime. The analysis is carried out by linearizing the model close to a stable stationary solution, and considering effect of noise as stochastic perturbations expressed by Langevin forces. At a linear level, pertubations concerning the total intensity and carrier inversion dynamics decouple from the energy distribution processes between the two modes. This fact permits a full analytic analysis, well confirmed by numerical simulations of the complete non linear system. The analysis shows that semiconductor ring lasers have peculiar noise properties. On one side the total intensity and carrier density show a noise spectrum characterized by a resonance induced by the typical field-medium exchange processes (relaxation oscillations) and the global phase invariance induced by the Goldstone mode, {{so as far as}} those variables are concerned, it behaves as a standard single-mode Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser. Besides, the degree of freedom associated to the simultaneous presence of two counterpropagating modes allows for a further process of energy exchange between the two modes. Our analysis unveils that such process presents a resonance peak as well, influenced mainly by the backscattering parameters, and can be excited in the bidirectional regime as a ’noisy precursor’ of a Hopf bifurcation. The present work represents the development of reliable tools for the simulation and analytical analysis of a model for semiconductor ring lasers. Reliability is tested by a thoughout comparison between simulation and calculations. Future developments will range from quantitative evaluation of two-times correlations functions, to applications to rotation sensing, to analysis of the stochastic jumps induced by noise in the bistable regime.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} physics of room-temperature optical nonlinearities in GaAs and their application to the <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> gates. The microscopic origins of the room-temperature optical nonlinearities in GaAs are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The data of nonlinear absorption measurement are analyzed {{in the framework of}} a semiconductor plasma theory in combination with excitation-dependent line broadening. The importance of the plasma screening of the continuum-state Coulomb enhancement and band filling are emphasized for GaAs at room temperature. Optical bistability and <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> gating are direct consequences of the nonlinear refractive index changes in etalons. The nonlinear index changes are directly measured by a new technique of observing the Fabry-Perot transmission peak shift using the self-photoluminescence as a broad-band source. The validity of a Kramers-Kronig technique under quasi-steady state conditions is crosschecked by an independent measurement of Δn under identical pumping conditions. Thermal index changes are also directly measured to establish the criteria on the temperature stability condition that is needed for reliable operation of devices based on dispersive nonlinearities. <b>Optical</b> <b>logic</b> gates based on dispersive optical nonlinearities may be the critical components of an all-optical computer in the future. Five <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> functions are demonstrated in a nonlinear GaAs/AlGaAs MQW etalon.

40|$|Coherent {{optical signal}} {{processing}} systems typically require dynamic, low-loss phase changes of an optical signal. Waveform generation employing phase modulation {{is an important}} application area. In particular, laser radar systems {{have been shown to}} perform better with non-linear frequency chirps. This work shows how dynamically tunable <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> ring resonators are able to produce such phase changes to a signal in an effective manner and offer new possibilities for the detection of phase-modulated optical signals. When designing and fabricating dynamically tunable <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> ring resonators for any application, system level requirements must be taken into account. For frequency chirped laser radar systems, the primary system level requirements are good long range performance and fine range resolution. These mainly depend on the first sidelobe level and mainlobe width of the autocorrelation of the chirp. Through simulation, the sidelobe level and mainlobe width of the autocorrelation of the non-linear frequency modulated chirp generated by a series of <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> ring resonators is shown to be significantly lower than the well-known tangent-FM chirp. Proof-of-concept experimentation is also important to verify simulation assumptions.

With applications ranging from ultra-dense transmission and fiber-to-the-home to all-optically routed networks and optical computing, bidirectional fiber optic links and <b>optical</b> digital <b>logic</b> {{play an important role}} in future photonics systems. As with any communication systems, the fundamental performance of bidirectional and <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> systems is ultimately limited by noise. In this thesis, the impact of optical noise in bidirectional and <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> systems is investigated with the goal of determining the optimal design and performance requirements of future systems. Two types of bidirectional optical systems are analyzed: interleaved bidirectional systems and passive optical networks. It is demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that Rayleigh backscattering noise is a fundamental limitation in bidirectional systems. Owing to its absence in conventional unidirectional systems, Rayleigh backscattering noise is an oft neglected noise mechanism in optical fiber systems and few design rules exist which seek to minimize its impact. It is shown that in bidirectional fiber systems, Rayleigh backscattering places markedly unique constraints on optical link design with respect to receiver design, system power budget, capacity and choice of modulation format. New design rules are offered which rigorously account for the deleterious impact of Rayleigh backscattering noise in fiber optic systems. This thesis also addresses the role of noise in future <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> systems.
