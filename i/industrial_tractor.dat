50|$|The three-point hitch (British English: three-point linkage) is {{a widely}} used type of hitch for {{attaching}} ploughs and other implements to an agricultural or <b>industrial</b> <b>tractor.</b> The three points resemble either a triangle, or the letter A. Three-point attachment is the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{variation}} of the classic farm tractor is the hoe, also called a hoe-loader. As the name implies, it has a loader assembly {{on the front and}} a backhoe on the back. Backhoes attach to a three-point hitch on farm or <b>industrial</b> <b>tractors.</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>tractors</b> are often heavier in construction, particularly with regards to the use of steel grill for protection from rocks and the use of construction tires. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the hoe controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment.|$|R
50|$|American Tractor Corporation (ATC) was an American {{manufacturer}} of tracked type agricultural and <b>industrial</b> <b>tractors</b> based in Churubusco, Indiana. Their tractors were marketed using the “Terra” prefix before a descriptive term. The bulldozers {{were referred to}} as Terra Dozers, the general purpose tractors Terra Tracs and the backhoes Terra Hoes. ATC was purchased by the J.I. Case Company in 1957 primarily to obtain ATC’s unique backhoe design.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the largest}} {{industrial}} facility in Chuvashia is Promtraktor (JSC). Promtraktor {{is the only}} plant in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) manufacturing powerful tracked and wheeled <b>industrial</b> <b>tractors,</b> bulldozers, lift trucks, and pipelayers. The vehicles are powered by technology similar to Caterpillar, and their products are used for large volume excavation {{in a wide variety}} of industry sectors. Promtraktor products are used throughout the CIS, Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the heavy}} {{industry}} in Chuvashia can trace its roots back to a decision of the Soviet government in the 1960s to make Cheboksary the center for <b>industrial</b> <b>tractor</b> production for the entire Soviet Union. Facilities related to tractor production grew quickly throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and in the 1990s the entire complex was privatized.|$|E
50|$|The Allis-Chalmers model B was {{a tractor}} {{produced}} by the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing company from 1937 to 1957. With over 125,000 units produced, the model B {{became one of the}} best selling tractors for Allis-Chalmers and most loved tractors of its time. Known best for its versatility and adaptability, the model B {{was also one of the}} longest production tractors for Allis-Chalmers as well. Over the years of production the B came in several different variations including the Asparagus B, Potato Special, and the IB <b>industrial</b> <b>tractor.</b> The Model B was designed by Brooks Stevens an industrial designer and graphic designer.|$|E

25|$|In 1928, Henry Ford {{canceled}} U.S. {{production of}} the Fordson. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons (for example, the Gleaner combines of the 1920s mounted on Fordsons, and many Fordson <b>industrial</b> <b>tractors</b> used aftermarket attachments). Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor & Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis-Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now-missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, {{the onset of the}} Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis-Chalmers Model U.|$|R
40|$|One way to {{organize}} workers that lies between traditional assembly lines, where workers are specialists, and craft assembly, where workers are generalists, are “bucket brigades. ” We describe how one firm used bucket brigades {{as an intermediate}} strategy to migrate from craft assembly to assembly lines. The adoption of bucket brigades led to a narrowing of tasks for each worker and thus accelerated learning. The increased production more than compensated for the time lost when workers walk back to get more work, which was significant in this implementation. To understand the trade-offs in migrating from craft to assembly lines, we extend the standard model of bucket brigades to capture hand-off and walk-back times. Key words: bucket brigades; assembly line; work sharing; dynamical system; self-organizing system History: Received: August 27, 2002; accepted: November 1, 2004.

40|$|AbstractA {{traction}} {{electric drive}} {{is used for}} an <b>industrial</b> <b>tractor.</b> The motor consists of a generator, a controlled rectifier, autonomous inverters, and two onboard motors. The key feature of the introduced electric drive {{is the use of}} field regulated independent excitation reluctance machine as a generator and traction motors. These electric machines have the following performance specifications: the generator and motor design is brushless; and simple, the rotor has high mechanical stiffness that increases reliability at high rate and overloads. There are no turns on the rotor; the motor is designed for simplicity of manufacture. The drives have increased effectiveness in terms of the effect of a “cold” rotor frame; the motors have high torque overloads power (up to 4 - 6 times the values of nominal torque). The turns of the motor and the generator are one- layered with full pitch capability of current and voltage. The drive manipulation is based on the transistors. The interval of the torque regulation is 1 : 10 resulting in permanent power for the drive [1]. This motor is used not only as a traction drive, but because of the simplicity of a frame it may be used for other devices where high load working cycles are required for operation...|$|E

50|$|The {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union hit the Cuban economy severely. The country lost approximately 80% of its imports, 80% of its exports and its Gross Domestic Product dropped by 34%. Food and medicine imports stopped or severely slowed. The largest immediate impact was the loss of {{nearly all of the}} petroleum imports from the USSR; Cuba's oil imports dropped to 10% of pre-1990 amounts. Before this, Cuba had been re-exporting any Soviet petroleum it did not consume to other nations for profit, meaning that petroleum had been Cuba's second largest export product before 1990. Once the restored Russian Federation emerged from the former Soviet Union, its administration immediately made clear that it had no intention of delivering petroleum that had been guaranteed the island by the USSR; this resulted in a decrease in Cuban consumption by 20% of its previous level within two years. The effect was felt immediately. Entirely dependent on fossil fuels to operate, the major underpinnings of Cuban society—its transport, industrial and agricultural systems—were paralyzed. There were extensive losses of productivity in both Cuban agriculture—which was dominated by modern <b>industrial</b> <b>tractors,</b> combines, and harvesters, all of which required petroleum to run—and in Cuban industrial capacity.|$|R

5000|$|To {{the extent}} that {{cultivating}} is done commercially today (such as in truck farming), it is usually powered by tractors, especially row-crop <b>tractors.</b> <b>Industrial</b> cultivators can vary greatly in size and shape, from 10 ft to 80 ft wide. Many are equipped with hydraulic wings that fold up to make road travel easier and safer. Different types are used for preparation of fields before planting, and for the control of weeds between row crops. The cultivator may be an implement trailed after the tractor via a drawbar; mounted on the three-point hitch; or mounted on a frame beneath the tractor. Active cultivator implements are driven by a power take-off shaft. While most cultivator are considered a secondary tillage implement, active cultivators are commonly used for primary tillage in lighter soils instead of plowing. The largest versions available are about 6 m wide, and require a tractor with an excess of [...] (PTO) to drive them.|$|R
