In 2011, <b>Flight</b> <b>Options</b> received delivery of more business jets than any operator worldwide. These included such innovative planes as the Embraer Phenom 300 executive jet, making <b>Flight</b> <b>Options</b> the first fractional provider in the world to offer that aircraft.

50|$|Silvestro {{began his}} {{aviation}} career at <b>Flight</b> <b>Options</b> in 2000, which his former Notre Dame roommate Kenn Ricci had founded in 1998. Silvestro served <b>Flight</b> <b>Options</b> as Vice President of Sales and Marketing from 2000 to 2005, helping to pioneer the company’s approach of selling fractional shares in refurbished {{as well as}} new aircraft. During his tenure, he helped to build <b>Flight</b> <b>Options</b> into the industry’s second-ranked company, with more than 200 aircraft and several thousand fractional and jet card customers.|$|R
5000|$|Ricci {{left the}} company in 2003, [...] but then re-purchased a stake in <b>Flight</b> <b>Options</b> in April 2008 and rejoined the company as {{chairman}} that summer.

50|$|The {{wholesaler}} would typically {{also require}} special discounted fares/rates from the travel suppliers. For car rental, the supplier (car rental company or intermediary) should ideally supply their price based on calendar days rather than hour-by-hour. Calendar day rates {{reduce the number}} of vehicle availability/pricing scans the wholesaler must make. For packages that include flights, the outbound arrival and return departure date/times determine the car rental pick-up and drop-off date/times. If car rental rates were by the hour they would differ for each <b>flight</b> <b>option,</b> hence the wholesaler would have to issue a vehicle availability search for each available flight, while with 24-hour rates one single vehicle availability search is enough to cater for all <b>flight</b> <b>options.</b>|$|R
