25|$|Engineers in {{the nineteenth}} century {{understood}} that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers patented continuous bridges with <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a statically determinate system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations.

25|$|The <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> {{along an}} entire folded surface form a hinge line, {{which can be}} either a crest line or a trough line. The trend and plunge of a linear hinge line gives you {{information}} about {{the orientation of the}} fold. To more completely describe the orientation of a fold, one must describe the axial surface. The axial surface is the surface defined by connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folding surfaces. If the axial surface is a planar surface then it is called the axial plane and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane. An axial trace is the line of intersection of the axial surface with any other surface (ground, side of mountain, geological cross-section).|$|E
25|$|The bending of {{the neural}} plate {{involves}} {{the formation of}} hinges, where the neural plate is connected to surrounding tissues. The midline of the neural plate is referred to the median <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> (MHP). Cells in this area, known as medial <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> cells because of their involvement with this structure, are stabilized and connected to the notochord. They are derived from {{the area of the}} neural plate anterior to primitive knot. The notochord will begin the shape changes in MHP cells. These cells will decrease in height and become wedge-shaped. Another type of <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> occurs dorsal-laterally, referred to as dorsal-lateral <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> (DLHP). These regions furrow and change shape {{in the same way as}} MHP cells do before connecting together to form the neural tube. It was seen in an experiment that without the notochord, the MHP characteristics did not develop correctly, so the neural plate and neural tube formation did not happen properly. The communication between the neural plate and the notochord is important for the future induction and formation of the neural tube.|$|R

For Kp less than 2 the apparent hinging distance is close to 11 earth radii. For Kp greater than 4 the apparent hinging distance is close to zero. This dependency reflects a negligible return of the neutral sheet to the solar magnetospheric equatorial plane with distance behind the earth at quiet times but reflects a rapid return at disturbed times, in addition to possible variations in the location of the <b>hinging</b> <b>point</b> in the geomagnetic equatorial plane...|$|R
30|$|After wedge removal, the resected wedge is {{inspected}} for completeness as remaining bone fragments {{may cause}} incomplete closure and fracture of the medial cortical hinge during closure. If this is found, additional bone removal and {{weakening of the}} hinge (with help of a special bone impaction instrument—a blunt chisel) are then indicated. Closure of the wedge must be performed gradually and with a gentle valgus force. It may take several minutes to enable plastic deformation of the medial cortex to close the osteotomy gap. It {{should be noted that}} the medial cortex of the distal femur in general is weaker and the <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> of the osteotomy will fracture more often as compared to the lateral cortex <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> in a medial closing-wedge osteotomy.

50|$|The {{addition}} of ATP and GroES has a drastic {{effect on the}} conformation of the cis domain. This effect is caused by flexion and rotation at the two <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> on the Hsp60 monomers. The intermediate domain folds down and inward about 25° on the lower hinge. This effect, multiplied through the cooperative flexing of all monomers, increases the equatorial diameter of the GroEL cage. But the apical domain rotates a full 60° up and out on the upper hinge, and also rotates 90° around the hinge axis. This motion opens the cage very widely {{at the top of}} the cis domain, but completely removes the substrate binding sites from the inside of the cage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} the flat neural plate folding into the {{cylindrical}} neural tube is termed primary neurulation. As {{a result of the}} cellular shape changes, the neural plate forms the medial hinge point (MHP) [...] The expanding epidermis puts pressure on the MHP and causes the neural plate to fold resulting in neural folds and the creation of the neural groove. The neural folds form dorsolateral <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> (DLHP) and pressure on this hinge causes the neural folds to meet and fuse at the midline. The fusion requires the regulation of cell adhesion molecules. The neural plate switches from E-cadherin expression to N-cadherin and N-CAM expression to recognize each other as the same tissue and close the tube. This change in expression stops the binding of the neural tube to the epidermis. Neural plate folding is a complicated step.|$|E
40|$|From the {{observed}} times when Pioneer 10 and Voyager 1 observe particle flux maxima and minima {{and when the}} magnetic field strength is at minimum a geometric description of the current sheet in Jupiter's magnetosphere is derived. It lags the planetary rotation by an angle delta which varies {{as a function of}} radial distance as delta equals 22 deg + 0. 80 (r - 16. 3). The maximum latitude of the current sheet is roughly 10 deg inside of 60 Jovian radii and decreases beyond. Thus there is a <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> near 60 Jovian radii. The position of the <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> moves in response to the external solar wind pressure variation. The variation of delta(r) is discussed theoretically and how it is related to the magnetic field topology and plasma flow is shown. It is concluded that the distant field lines do not corotate with Jupiter and that the Alfven speed at 50 Jovian radii is of the order of 1500 km/s. The topology of the current sheet is affected by centrifugal forces, outward mass transport and solar wind-magnetosphere interaction.
