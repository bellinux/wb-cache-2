5|$|The <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> HSV-1 {{has been}} found in the same areas as amyloid plaques. This {{suggested}} the possibility that AD could be treated or prevented with antiviral medication. Studies of antivirals in cell cultures have shown promising results.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus,</b> parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus,</b> varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 26 - 28) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine medical, behavioral and sociological risk factors associated with <b>Herpes</b> <b>Simplex</b> <b>Viruses</b> types I and II. Survey questionnaires were distributed to a group of male homosexual volunteers from the Gay Community Services Center (GCSC) located in Hollywood, California. Differences were studied between those medically diagnosed as having HSV-II, HSV-I and a Control Group free of <b>Herpes</b> <b>Simplex</b> <b>Viruses.</b> Comparisons were also made between those with a primary and secondary infections. Forty-eight percent were medically diagnosed as currently having HSV-II, seventeen percent reported symptoms of HSV-I and thirty-five percent had neither <b>Herpes</b> <b>Simplex</b> <b>Viruses.</b> An increase in susceptibility to HSV-II correlated with an increase in the number of reported venereal and non-venereal diseases. Those with HSV-I also reported an increased susceptibility to a number of other diseases...|$|R
50|$|Although {{for a long}} time, {{the cause}} of Mollaret's {{meningitis}} was not known, recent work has associated this problem with <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses,</b> which cause cold sores, occular herpes as well as genital herpes.|$|R
25|$|SDS {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a potentially effective topical microbicide, for intravaginal use, to inhibit and possibly prevent infection by various enveloped and non-enveloped viruses such as the <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses,</b> HIV, and the Semliki Forest virus.|$|R
5|$|Potential {{antiviral}} therapies include topical microbicide {{treatments that}} use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard Medical School; in mice, so far) by <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression, and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases {{have also been}} proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (<b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus,</b> type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E
50|$|Vmw65, {{also known}} as VP16 or α-TIF (Trans Inducing Factor) is a {{trans-acting}} protein that forms a complex with the host transcription factors Oct-1 and HCF to induce immediate early gene transcription in the <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Corey’s early {{research}} {{dealt with}} <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses</b> and he headed several landmark studies defining {{the disease and}} leading the licensure of acyclovir and valacyclovir for its treatment. This included a study to reduce acquisition among sexual partners.|$|R
50|$|In animal trials {{the drug}} has shown {{activity}} against cytomegalovirus, adenoviruses, BK <b>virus,</b> smallpox, and <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses.</b> Preliminary in vitro tests have also shown {{it to have}} potential {{for the treatment of}} Ebola virus disease, which is somewhat paradoxical, as Ebola is not a DNA virus.|$|R
5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. <b>Herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> carried by humans.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus.</b> Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

25|$|Within Herpesviridae, CMV {{belongs to}} the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which also {{includes}} the genera Muromegalovirus and Roseolovirus (HHV-6 and HHV-7). It is related to other herpesviruses within the subfamilies of Alphaherpesvirinae that includes <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses</b> (HSV)-1 and -2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily that includes Epstein–Barr virus.|$|R
50|$|Cytomegalovirus (a type of herpes virus) is {{what causes}} {{cytomegalovirus}} retinitis. Other types of <b>herpes</b> <b>viruses</b> include <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses</b> and Epstein-Barr virus. Once {{an individual is}} infected with these viruses they stay in the body for life. What triggers the virus to reactivate are the following (though CMV can also be congenital).|$|R
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus,</b> type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E
5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus</b> that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (GM-CSF) that stimulates immunity. When this virus infects cancer cells, it destroys them and in doing so the presence the GM-CSF gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The dendritic cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called oncolytic viruses.|$|E

40|$|Heparan sulfate (HS) {{serves as}} a {{receptor}} for adherence of <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses,</b> Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and, indirectly, human immunodeficiency virus. Using primary human culture systems, we identified sulfated carbohydrate compounds that resemble HS and competitively inhibit infection by these pathogens. These compounds are candidates for intravaginal formulations {{for the prevention of}} sexually transmitted diseases...|$|R
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus,</b> which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>virus.</b> Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses</b> {{can affect}} areas of skin exposed to {{contact with an}} {{infected}} person (although shaking hands with an infected person does not transmit this disease) [...] An {{example of this is}} herpetic whitlow which is a herpes infection on the fingers.

50|$|This phosphonic acid {{derivative}} (marketed by Clinigen as {{foscarnet sodium}} under the trade name Foscavir) is an antiviral medication {{used to treat}} herpes viruses, including drug-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) and <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses</b> types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). It is particularly used to treat CMV retinitis. Foscarnet {{can be used to}} treat highly treatment-experienced patients with HIV as part of salvage therapy.|$|R

5000|$|One {{example is}} Herpes Virus family, Herpesviridae, {{all of which}} {{establish}} latent infection. Herpes virus include Chicken-pox <b>virus</b> and <b>Herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses</b> (HSV-1, HSV-2), all of which establish episomal latency in neurons and leave linear genetic material floating in the cytoplasm. [...] The Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily is associated with episomal latency established in cells of the immune system, such as B-cells {{in the case of}} Epstein-Barr Virus. [...] In the case of <b>Herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> (HSV), the <b>virus</b> has been shown that it fuses with DNA in neurons, such as brain cells, and HSV reactivates upon even minor chromatin loosening with stress, although the chromatin compacts (becomes latent) upon oxygen and nutrient deprivation.|$|R
40|$|Type-specific {{vaccines}} containing heat-inactivated <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> hominis <b>virus</b> type 1 or 2 {{have been}} developed for the treatment of <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> genitalis. When patients with recurrent herpes genitalis were treated with the type 2 vaccine the clinical course of the disease improved and the eruption-free interval was extended. In severe cases, especially in permanent genital herpes, the concurrent administration of vaccine and immunoglobulin concentrates improved the clinical course of the disease. Antibody titres and the in-vitro stimulation of lymphocytes with phytohaemagglutinin or <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> hominis <b>virus</b> antigens remained constant during administration of the vaccine...|$|R
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral {{conjunctivitis}} (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (caused by <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>viruses)</b> can be serious and requires treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|R
