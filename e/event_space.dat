5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private <b>event</b> <b>space</b> and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a race in Hong Kong was first raised in 2013 with a design team visiting the city and was {{intended}} {{to be included in the}} 2014–15 season schedule but negotiations and approval from local authorities and motorsport's international governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), went longer than anticipated. In October 2015 the Hong Kong ePrix was announced by the CEO and founder of Formula E Alejandro Agag in a press conference at the Central Harbour Front <b>Event</b> <b>Space</b> but pended further review from the FIA. The event was later confirmed as part of Formula E's 2016-17 series schedule in September 2016 by the FIA World Motor Sport Council. It was the first of 12 scheduled single-seater electric car races of the season, and was held on 9 October 2016 at the Hong Kong Central Harbourfront Circuit. The event was contested by ten teams of two drivers each. The teams were e.Dams-Renault, Audi Sport ABT, Virgin, Dragon, Mahindra, Venturi, Andretti, Techeetah, NextEV and Jaguar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the formalization of an algorithm for slicing Java <b>event</b> <b>spaces</b> in PVS. In short, Java <b>event</b> <b>spaces</b> describe how multi-threaded Java programs operate in memory. We show that Java <b>event</b> <b>spaces</b> can be sliced following an algorithm introduced in previous work and still preserve properties in {{a subset of}} CTL. The formalization and proof {{presented in this paper}} can be extended to other state-space reduction techniques as long as some sufficient conditions are fulfilled. ...|$|R

5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the <b>event</b> <b>space,</b> a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E

25|$|Consider an {{experiment}} {{that can produce}} a number of outcomes. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space of the experiment. The power set of the sample space (or equivalently, the <b>event</b> <b>space)</b> is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling an honest die produces one of six possible results. One collection of possible results corresponds to getting an odd number. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} {{is an element of}} the power set of the sample space of die rolls. These collections are called events. In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. If the results that actually occur fall in a given event, that event is said to have occurred.|$|E
25|$|The Phi Chapter of Alpha Gamma Rho was locally {{established}} May 1 of 1923 at UC Davis {{making it}} the first continuously running national fraternity on campus.

Many campus buildings are named after alumni of Alpha Gamma Rho such as Emil Mrak (Mrak Hall, Registrar's office), Orville Thompson (Thompson Hall, Segundo student housing), and Dean De Carli (the De Carli room, 2nd floor MU), Mel Olson Scoreboard (Aggie Stadium), and many more. The AGR Hall is an <b>event</b> <b>space</b> located inside the Buehler Alumni / Visitor's Center and is commonly rented out as a conference room or banquet hall.

25|$|Valley Craftsmen, of Baltimore, Maryland, {{restored}} the elaborate Art Deco lobby. They re-stenciled the beamed ceiling in a geometric Art Deco design using gold leaf, and hand-painted {{the walls to}} resemble the original veneer panels. The Saul Company replaced the missing Art Deco chandeliers and wall sconces and {{restored the}} handsome inlaid Art Deco elevator doors on the second, third, and fourth floors. On {{each side of the}} lobby is a lounge. The south lounge was restored to its original design and the north lounge was converted to a piano-bar, which is open to residents. On the second floor, there is ballroom with fine Art Deco detailing. The ballroom was a popular venue for events of all kinds, and many of the best known big bands of the era played there. It has been closed for many years, but current plans (2011) call for it to be restored and reopened as an <b>event</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{building}} became a royal residence, additions {{to accommodate the}} viceregal party and household were required, including a ballroom and sunroom. These, however, were on 2 February 1976 destroyed by fire and the other rooms of the residence suffered smoke and water damage. The Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada (which oversees the infrastructure of the Citadelle) restored the original wing and new state rooms were built {{in place of the}} lost post-1872 additions, the work being completed in 1984. This new wing was built at the east end of and at a slight angle to the 1831 structure, the roof being copper and the exterior walls of the same masonry as the adjacent buildings, but, using more regulated block sizes and a flatter relief of pilasters and windows, as well as less detailing overall. The wing contains a separate entrance and ceremonial foyer with twin spiral staircases ascending to a piano nobile; the stairs have wood handrails with aluminum pickets and between them is a niche for sculpture. On the upper level is an <b>event</b> <b>space,</b> lounge, and sunroom with a terrace overlooking the St. Lawrence River. The former two areas are fully barrel vaulted and linked together by a continuous, narrow skylight in the roof under which crystal pendants of different lengths hang and transfer the natural light into the rooms. Interiors of the modern addition were designed by Quebec artist Madeleine Arbour, who was inspired by the colours of winter in Quebec, and use Canadian materials, including granite, walnut, and aluminum. The residence is furnished with pieces from the Crown Collection, mostly in New France style, antique furniture mixed with contemporary Canadian art.|$|E
