5|$|Modern mythographers {{have seen}} the story of Orion {{as a way to}} access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E

25|$|A shark attack <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> {{on a human}} by a shark. Every {{year over}} 70 attacks are {{reported}} worldwide. Despite their relative rarity, many people fear shark attacks after occasional serial attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and horror fiction and films such as the Jaws series. Out of more than 489 shark species, only three are responsible for a double-digit number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger, and bull. The oceanic whitetip has probably killed many more castaways, {{but these are not}} recorded in the statistics.|$|E

25|$|Much {{of modern}} {{scholarship}} of Huckleberry Finn {{has focused on}} its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars {{have argued that the}} book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on racism. Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim. According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.|$|E

The Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has also suggested that the recent financial market crisis in Europe is an attempt to undermine the euro.

500|$|Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that no fortifications {{and naval}} bases may {{be built on}} Svalbard, nor can the archipelago be used for [...] "warlike purposes". The preparatory work of the treaty and later state practice has been to enforce that no military activity is carried out on the archipelago; however, the treaty as such does not ban, for instance, the construction of air stations or military installations not regarded as defense works. There is scholarly consensus that Article 9 is unclear, but that a military presence should only be established when there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> or threat of attack on Svalbard. Norway can clearly not use Svalbard to make a threat of war, but retains the right to self-defense against an attack on Svalbard. However, the right does not allow Norway to bring Svalbard into war as part of self-defense of {{other parts of the}} country.|$|E

500|$|The {{gestation}} of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, {{was only}} slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with [...] "A Career" [...] as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: [...] "'At the Store' {{is a tribute to}} the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.|$|E

Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me shaking my head.

[...] University of Michigan student Munmun Khan also stated that while she doesn't like beauty pageants, she hates [...] "racism and bigotry even more [...] Not only was [...] the first Indian Miss New York, but she is now also the first Indian Miss America. All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated just because we disdain that woman's choices.

500|$|The {{political}} climate in the United States and in Arizona {{in particular was}} pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, Clarence Dupnik, Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, [...] "When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol {{that comes out of}} certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous." [...] He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become [...] "the capital" [...] of such feelings. [...] "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," [...] he said. But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard. International media referred to the {{political climate}} in the United States and the Palin map in particular. The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm [...] "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence." [...] President Obama called the shooting an [...] "unspeakable tragedy", adding that [...] "such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society". Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack [...] "senseless and cruel violence" [...] and House Speaker John Boehner said, [...] "An attack on one who serves <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society". Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement noting, [...] "we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own", with the death of Chief Judge John Roll.|$|E
