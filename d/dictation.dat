5|$|Smith {{said that}} the angel {{returned}} the plates to him in September, 1828. In April 1829, he met Oliver Cowdery, who replaced Harris as his scribe, and resumed <b>dictation.</b> They worked full time on the manuscript between April and early June 1829, and then moved to Fayette, New York, where they continued {{to work at the}} home of Cowdery's friend, Peter Whitmer. When the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other. <b>Dictation</b> was completed around July 1, 1829.|$|E
5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} stems {{from the use of}} {{multilingual}} puns which draw {{on a wide range of}} languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's <b>dictation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neild {{was not a}} {{supporter}} of party discipline, refusing to follow Sir Josiah Symon's leadership of the Free Trade Senators. He spoke against the <b>dictation</b> test for non-British immigrants and the deportation of Kanaka workers, and continued to advocate free trade and old-age pensions. Having won the fifth position at the 1901 election, Neild faced re-election in 1903, and his impassioned support of the British Empire saw him elected {{at the head of}} the poll despite failing health.|$|E

5|$|Unanimity was {{required}} for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was {{a reflection of the}} League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by <b>dictation.</b> In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him {{on the outside of}} his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the <b>dictation</b> test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his <b>dictation.</b> Harris {{also took a}} sample of the {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he was the victim of a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E

5|$|As a senator, Walker {{devoted his}} support {{to a variety}} of causes, {{including}} a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women. He opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the <b>dictation</b> test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia {{for at least five years}} be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice <b>dictation,</b> and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E
