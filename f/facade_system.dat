This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{definition}} of the most rational technique of reliability evaluation of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> of multistoried residential buildings with using the experience of buildings construction and operation abroad. The subject is also focused on defining the parameters of materials and <b>facade</b> <b>systems,</b> the improvement of which can increase the reliability and durability of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> of multistoried residential buildings, as well as cut the cost of their operation. Methodology. A comparative analysis of the operating experience of various types of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> in Ukraine and abroad based on the data of different authors was conducted. The analysis of the impact of external factors on <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> with the subsequent comparison of methods for assessing the reliability of facades according to the criteria stated in the Eurocode was carried out as well as the selection of parameters that determine the reliability and durability of <b>facade</b> <b>systems.</b> Findings. Authors have performed researches of evaluation methods of organizational and technological reliability and durability of modern <b>facade</b> <b>systems.</b> It was identified the cause of the failure of <b>facade</b> <b>systems.</b> It is offered the ways of materials improvement of <b>facade</b> <b>systems,</b> and constructional and organization-technological decisions on the structure of <b>facade</b> <b>systems.</b> Methods of increase of reliability and durability of front systems were defined. Originality. The most rational technique of reliability evaluation of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> considering requirements of Eurocode in questions structural design was defined. Practical value. Improvement of evaluating methods for organizational-technological reliability of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> of multistoried residential buildings will predict more accurately the lifetime of enclosures. Using the methods described in the Eurocodes, to determine the reliability and durability of the <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> will provide the general criteria for the building structures design in Ukraine and Europe, as well as facilitate the exchange of experience in the construction and operation of buildings between the countries of Europe. An analysis of the causes of failures of facades enables to determine the directions of improving the properties of the materials used for the manufacture of facade elements structures as well as engineering and technological solutions of applied <b>facade</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{are one of}} the {{important}} energy consuming sectors. The increasing environmental awareness has triggered a great emphasis on sustainable design in the current global building industry. Since the past century, there has been a distinct growing trend in the use of fully glazed facade in office buildings. This paper discussed and analysed how solar control and natural ventilation systems can be integrated into double skin <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> to minimise the environmental impacts. Sun shading should be considered {{as an integral part of}} fenestration system design that is adapted into the facade design of office buildings. The technology of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> that integrate solar control and ventilation systems encompasses a wide range of strategies resulting in energy efficient building design. Such <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> minimise overheating and excessive solar gains during summer whilst increasing direct solar gains during winter to minimise the use of mechanical heating. Through case studies, this paper examines the performances of different double skin <b>facades</b> <b>systems.</b> Evaluations and recommendations are made to enhance the future designs of glass <b>facade</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Façades with building-integrated {{photovoltaics}} (BIPV) {{have the}} advantage that they can produce renewable electric energy. Compared with conventional façades, BIPV façades have therefore a valuable additional property that can generally contribute to increasing the degree of sustainability of buildings. A holistic assessment <b>system</b> for BIPV <b>façade</b> <b>systems</b> for office and administration buildings {{was developed in the}} framework of the project "MULTIELEMENT II" at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology (IWES) in Kassel, Germany. The aim of this research was a comparison of conventional <b>façade</b> <b>systems</b> with BIPV <b>façade</b> <b>systems</b> regarding different technical, economical, sustainability, and design criteria. This paper discusses the basic conditions for a holistic evaluation of BIPV façades in comparison with conventional façades. A method for the execution of a holistic evaluation and characteristic values for a comparison interpretation of results is presented. <b>Façade</b> <b>systems</b> are evaluated regarding both quantifiable and non-quantifiable properties by means of a Microsoft Excel-based evaluation tool. The tool facilitates the comparison and evaluation of planned or built façades with and without BIPV. The detailed evaluation results aim to facilitate the certification of BIPV <b>façade</b> <b>systems</b> in the framework of sustainable building certification systems such as the German DGNB...|$|R

40|$|<b>Facade</b> <b>systems</b> are an {{integral}} part of modern day construction, especially with reinforced concrete structures. These <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> are typically designed to withstand the effects of normal service loads and severe weather conditions.

5000|$|Serious {{problems}} exist {{with the}} existing <b>facade</b> <b>system.</b> The building was designed several years before the 1970s energy crisis, and the <b>facade</b> <b>system</b> does not manage heat at all. [...] The facade of the tower is formed of two parts, the concrete brutalist structure, and wood and glass assembly storefront systems. Many of the original single panes of glass have been replaced, either with double glazing in the existing wood frame, or plexiglass. The overall result is a minimal improvement in thermal performance. Overall the wood facade elements are warped and cracking, and do not seal well. The single-layer construction bleeds heat at an appreciable rate. Further, the concrete elements bridge from the outdoors to the indoors, conducting heat from the interior to the exterior, where the concrete acts as a heat fin in a phenomenon called a Thermal bridge.|$|E

Four <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> have been examined. Three of the <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> were different in that there was one ventilated system, one single-stage sealing system and two drained systems. To better understand the exact importance of seals and variations in installation and workmanship, these factors have also been studied. The measurements show significant water leakage where seals are absent. Even in cases with seals present, there are leakages. Although the installations were performed by professionals, it was still leaky which shows that <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> with window fittings should be designed and tested for any anticipated defects in order to ensure that the exterior wall are not subject to moisture damage...|$|R

40|$|In modern office buildings, maximum {{priority}} {{is given to}} planning certainty for high-quality working conditions, coupled with low operating costs and low energy consumption. This objective can only be attained if regulation of <b>facade</b> <b>systems</b> and direction-dependent solar irradiation {{are taken into account}} when planning the building. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the utilised systems towards different control strategies or user interventions is frequently neglected.
