The present study included a sample of 133 Chinese university students who were Christians. The authors tested a mediation model which posited that intrinsic religiosity, but not extrinsic religiosity, lowered anxiety toward the <b>dying</b> <b>and</b> death of self and someone close through fostering perceived purpose in life. Structural Equation Modeling results supported a partial mediating role of purpose in life. Moreover, participants were more anxious toward the <b>dying</b> <b>and</b> death of someone close than those of themselves.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of the <b>die</b> <b>and</b> punch radii on the {{springback}} in the air V-die free bending process of stainless steel sheet metal. The experiment was performed on sheet metal using various <b>die</b> <b>and</b> punch radius values while their springback behavior was observed. The design of experiment approach was used in these experiments using the full factorial and analysis of variance methods to identify whether or not the <b>die</b> <b>and</b> punch radii are significant input parameters in predicting springback. From the statistical analysis, it shows that the <b>die</b> <b>and</b> punch radius parameters are significant factors contributing to the springback effect in the V-die bending of stainless steel sheet metal at the significance level of 0. 05 because their p-value is less than 0. 05. The results from the experiments showed that springback is affected by the <b>die</b> <b>and</b> punch radius values in the air V-bending experiments. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the springback values can be decreased by decreasing the values of the <b>die</b> <b>and</b> punch radii. In the air V-die bending process, the punch radius is the most important factor to be considered. The experimental method agreed well with the design of experiment results...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{an existential}} threat caused by the {{awareness}} of mortality has been rarely investigated within coping research. The study explores relationships between coping strategies <b>and</b> attitudes toward <b>dying</b> <b>and</b> death {{in a sample of}} German adults aged 20 to 93 years. Participants responded to a Stress Coping Inventory and a questionnaire for the multidimensional assessment of attitudes toward <b>dying</b> <b>and</b> death. Pearson correlations for men, women, and the young and old age-groups confirm the expect-ation that attitudes toward <b>dying</b> <b>and</b> death are mainly associated with disengage-ment and accommodative coping. Gender- and age-specific findings refer to drug intake and aggression. Results are discussed within both a coping and a thanatological frame of reference and issues for future research are outlined.

Following Collett and Lester (1969), four aspects that are often captured by the single word death can be discriminated.
