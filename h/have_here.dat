25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense {{but that it was}} understood from the beginning that it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team and so we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So what we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> is a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. Yet {{there is a sense that}} what she did was not new.|$|E
25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly {{tell you how}} this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who <b>have</b> <b>here</b> forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E
25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we <b>have</b> <b>here.</b> This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E

About 1806, Metcalfe married Nancy Mason of Fairfax, Virginia. The couple had four children. Between 1817 and 1820, Metcalfe built a house for his family in Nicholas County. The estate was dubbed [...] "Forest Retreat" [...] by statesman Henry Clay who, on {{his first visit to}} the newly constructed house, told Metcalfe, [...] "Tom, you <b>have</b> <b>here</b> a veritable Forest Retreat." ...|$|E

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars, commenting that [...] "what we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> is a {{superior}} historical drama and a powerful personal one."

500|$|Domestically, the Cold War {{was in the}} {{forefront}} of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>here</b> in my hand a list" [...] of over 200 communists who were employed in the State Department. McCarthy made the claim in The Wheeling speech. In September 1950, the USCongress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of J. Robert Oppenheimer.|$|E
500|$|Roche {{was also}} capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional. Once, upon hearing his {{opponent}} John Philpot Curran expostulate {{that he could}} be [...] "the guardian of his own honour", Sir Boyle offered his [...] "congratulations to the honourable member on his possession of a sinecure." [...] On another occasion, when the Opposition tried to cough him down in a debate, Sir Boyle met the interruption by producing some bullets, with the observation [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>here</b> some excellent pills to cure a cough." [...] His personal courage being beyond dispute, this jest was quite sufficient in those duelling days to procure attention for the remainder of his speech.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, {{when he gave}} a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are {{a matter of some}} debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists. I <b>have</b> <b>here</b> in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." ...|$|E

500|$|McCarthy's {{involvement}} with the ongoing cultural phenomenon that would bear his name began with a speech he made on Lincoln Day, February 9, 1950, to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. He produced {{a piece of paper}} which he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted as saying: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>here</b> in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." [...] This speech resulted in a flood of press attention to McCarthy and established the path that {{made him one of the}} most recognized politicians in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The Senators were {{particularly}} interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types, [...] "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on." [...] Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota responded: [...] "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> in this country." [...] Other witnesses described {{the horrors of the}} revolution in Russia and speculated on the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.|$|E
500|$|On 12 January 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of Burma began and Mingaladon was reinforced with a further eight aircraft. [...] Another Ki-27 Nate was credited {{to him on}} 20 January, and three days later he achieved [...] another victory but his aircraft was badly shot up {{and he had to}} crash land. The remainder of the 2nd Squadron were sent to Rangoon on 25 January. [...] On 28 January 1942, Newkirk told Chennault that the [...] "aeroplanes we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> are now are beginning to look like patchwork quilts for the holes in them. The engines are also getting tired" [...] Newkirk left Rangoon on 10 February but, to get to the AVG base in Kunming, he had to go via India. By 7 March 1942, Rangoon had fallen and the defense of the Burma Road became the priority of the Flying Tigers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, William Camden saw [...] "some secret constellation" [...] {{of the stars}} at work between Elizabeth and her favourite; he firmly {{established}} {{the legend of the}} perfect courtier with the sinister influence. Some of the most often-quoted characterisations of Leicester, such as that he [...] "was wont to put up all his passions in his pocket", his nickname of [...] "the Gypsy", and Elizabeth's [...] "I will <b>have</b> <b>here</b> but one mistress and no master"-reprimand to him, were contributed by Sir Henry Wotton and Sir Robert Naunton almost half a century after the Earl's death. The Victorian historian James Anthony Froude saw Robert Dudley as Elizabeth's soft plaything, combining [...] "in himself the worst qualities of both sexes. Without courage, without talent, without virtue". The habit of comparing him unfavourably to William Cecil was continued by Conyers Read in 1925: [...] "Leicester was a selfish, unscrupulous courtier and Burghley a wise and patriotic statesman". Geoffrey Elton, in his widely read England under the Tudors (1955), saw Dudley as [...] "a handsome, vigorous man with very little sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> is a blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
500|$|On a mixed note, Toure of Rolling Stone {{stated that}} the album's [...] "few sublime moments {{outweigh}} the lackluster album around them," [...] further praising [...] "Prettyman" [...] for being [...] "a roaring up-tempo number" [...] but panning [...] "Undisputed" [...] and [...] "Hot Wit' U" [...] for being [...] "the worst of his nineties work". Eamon Sweeney from Hot Press was also mixed in his review, stating that it [...] "would be hard to name another artist who can produce such a perfect soundtrack", but found at times that the singer [...] "ha lost his magic". Similarly, Robin Rothman of Village Voice enjoyed the collaborations, but opined that they would [...] "be better described as augmentations". In a very negative review, a critic from NME stated [...] "To paraphrase Woody Allen, genius is like a shark; it has to move forward or it dies. And what we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> is a patchily impressive, fleetingly satisfying, but very, very dead shark". In a list compiled by staff members from Stereogum ranking the singer's albums out of thirty positions, they listed Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic at number 25. The site's consensus stated that among the album's tracks, his cover of [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] was the only highlight.|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for {{the film}} have been mostly positive, with Fangoria Magazine saying [...] "here are genuine jolts to be <b>had</b> <b>here,</b> rather than simple gross-outs." ...|$|R
