500|$|Ferdinand Rockwell {{replaced}} Uteritz at quarterback. [...] When Rockwell {{came into}} the game, Michigan lined up for a field goal with Rockwell holding the ball. [...] As the Marines came through to block the kick, Rockwell <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and ran the ball 26 yards for a touchdown. [...] The touchdown run was Rockwell's first play for Michigan's varsity team. [...] In addition to the touchdowns by Uteritz and Rockwell, Michigan also scored on touchdowns by Jim Miller and Frederick Parker. [...] Due to an error by the official timekeeper, time was not called {{at the end of}} the first quarter, and the quarter consumed 33 minutes of playing time before the oversight was discovered. [...] The other three quarters were played for regulation periods of 15 minutes.|$|E
500|$|These insults {{culminated in}} an altercation {{between the two}} on March 16, 2003, at Pride 25. Following a victory over Kevin Randleman, Jackson was given the {{microphone}} and started talking directly to Silva, who was sitting at ringside, saying [...] "I want you boy. It's gonna be me and you." [...] Silva immediately <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and made his way}} into the ring. He was now face-to-face with Jackson, who continued by saying, [...] "You have my belt, you're keeping it warm for me." [...] Silva responded by yelling [...] "MY BELT!" [...] and giving Jackson a forceful shove. Jackson, visibly upset, advanced towards Silva as dozens of Pride officials intervened. Jackson stood still as he was surrounded by officials, while Silva had to be constantly restrained from charging at Jackson. Jackson later stated that he was instructed by Pride executives to make these comments. He added that Silva's shove infuriated him, and he was ready to fight Silva immediately.|$|E
500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities that had kept him [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing". He {{thought it was an}} outrage that the French regarded the dumping of an inconveniently dead body in a ravine as a crime. He {{even went so far as}} to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he shouted as police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E

2500|$|Mussolini, upon invading Ethiopia, had {{promptly}} {{declared his}} own [...] "Italian Empire." [...] Because the League of Nations afforded Haile Selassie {{the opportunity to}} address the assembly, Italy even withdrew its League delegation, on 12 May 1936. It was {{in this context that}} Haile Selassie walked into the hall of the League of Nations, introduced by the President of the Assembly as [...] "His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia" [...] (Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie). The introduction caused a great many Italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering, heckling, and whistling. As it turned out, they had earlier been issued whistles by Mussolini's son-in-law, Count Galeazzo Ciano. The Romanian delegate, Nicolae Titulescu, famously <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in response and cried [...] "Show the savages the door!", and they were cleared out. Haile Selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared, and responded [...] "majestically" [...] with a speech sometimes considered among the most stirring of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan won the 1916 game by a {{score of}} 9–0. [...] According to one account of the game, Michigan quarterback Cliff Sparks [...] "crumpled the Aggie line almost every time he crashed into it and circled ends with ease, and was eel-like in running back punts." [...] The play that drew the most {{attention}} was Sparks' drop-kick on a broken play that gave Michigan a 3-0 lead in the first quarter. [...] The play called for Sparks to take the snap from center and hold the ball for a field goal attempt. [...] The snap from center was high, forcing Sparks to react quickly. [...] One press account described Sparks' actions as follows:"And then seemingly with a single movement, Sparks <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> grabbed the ball as {{it was about to}} clear his head, whirled to face the goal posts and drop-kicked the ball over the Aggie bar for a count of three points, which then and there cinched the game for the Wolverines. 'It was the greatest individual play ever seen in my whole career as coach or player,' was 'Hurry Up' Yost's comment after the game. [...] And every person in the crowd who saw Sparks plan and execute that play in something less than two seconds chanted 'Amen!'" ...|$|E

60|$|My sudden {{question}} {{made the}} man almost <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> The bag dropped from <b>his</b> lap <b>to</b> the floor, and {{the keys in}} his hand jingled after it.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} the opening and {{shutting}} of a door, the soft frou-frou of a woman's skirt roused him from his gloomy reverie, and caused him <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed the trapper, <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and {{grasping}} Redfeather, who {{had also}} risen, by the two shoulders, stared wildly into his face; [...] "was it you that did it?" ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{no great}} gift, {{for there was}} mighty little wine left; but Signor Cavalletto, <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{received}} the bottle gratefully, turned it upside down at his mouth, and smacked his lips.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts, <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and {{dropping}} all her packages: [...] "No, no, it isn't, my dear! That's the Circuit Line train: didn't you hear? Ours doesn't go till ten to four, on the Main Line." ...|$|R

50|$|In Fokine's choreography, the Moor reclines on a divan {{playing with}} a coconut. He then <b>jumps</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and {{attempts}} <b>to</b> cut it with his scimitar. When he fails {{he believes that the}} coconut must be a god and proceeds to pray to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Is {{it a bit}} of a cocktail, {{the likes}} of the one I made for ye last Sunday unbeknownst?' sez he, looking round mortal afraid of the parents. And Sarah Walker's eyes said, 'It is.' Then the ministher groaned, but the docthor <b>jumps</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R

6000|$|His partner looked aghast at this temerity, but Fleming, <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> at once set out <b>to</b> meet <b>his</b> mysterious visitor.
