She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral <b>hydrate.</b> She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second victim had also ingested chloral <b>hydrate</b> in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs off into the woods. When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate <b>hydrate)</b> named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified.

Solid neon clathrate <b>hydrate</b> was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E

5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia <b>hydrate)</b> or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes, although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate <b>hydrate</b> and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline <b>hydrate</b> is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
40|$|Salt <b>hydrates</b> store {{solar energy}} in {{chemical}} form via a reversible dehydration–hydration reaction. However, {{as a side}} reaction to dehydration, hydrolysis (HCl formation) may occur in chloride based salt <b>hydrates</b> (specially in MgCl 2 <b>hydrates),</b> affecting the durability of the storage system. The mixture of CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 <b>hydrates</b> has been shown experimentally to have exceptional cycle stability and improved kinetics. However, the optimal operating conditions for the mixture are unknown. To understand the appropriate balance between dehydration and hydrolysis kinetics in the mixtures, {{it is essential to}} gain in-depth insight into the mixture components. We present a GGA-DFT level study to investigate the various gaseous structures of CaCl 2 <b>hydrates</b> and to understand the relative stability of their conformers. The hydration 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆estrength and relative stability of conformers are dominated by electrostatic interactions. A wide network of intramolecular homonuclear and heteronuclear hydrogen bonds is observed in CaCl 2 <b>hydrates.</b> Equilibrium product concentrations are obtained during dehydration and hydrolysis reactions under various temperature and pressure conditions. The trend of the dehydration curve with temperature in CaCl 2 <b>hydrates</b> is similar to the experiments. Comparing these results to those of MgCl 2 <b>hydrates,</b> we find that CaCl 2 <b>hydrates</b> are more resistant towards hydrolysis in the temperature range of 273 – 800 K. Specifically, the present study reveals that the onset temperatures of HCl formation, a crucial design parameter for MgCl 2 <b>hydrates,</b> are lower than 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆efor CaCl 2 <b>hydrates</b> except for the mono-hydrate...|$|R

5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably {{strong enough to}} melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia <b>hydrate)</b> or some salt was present.

If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. Freezing of the water would have led to expansion of the interior, which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon-like graben. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon is very limited.|$|E
5|$|The largest KBOs, such as Pluto and Quaoar, have {{surfaces}} rich in volatile compounds such as methane, {{nitrogen and}} carbon monoxide; {{the presence of}} these molecules is likely due to their moderate vapor pressure in the 30–50K temperature range of the Kuiper belt. This allows them to occasionally boil off their surfaces and then fall again as snow, whereas compounds with higher boiling points would remain solid. The relative abundances of these three compounds in the largest KBOs is directly related to their surface gravity and ambient temperature, which determines which they can retain. Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including members of the Haumea family such as , mid-sized objects such as 38628 Huya and 20000 Varuna, and also on some small objects. The presence of crystalline ice on large and mid-sized objects, including 50000 Quaoar where ammonia <b>hydrate</b> has also been detected, may indicate past tectonic activity aided by melting point lowering due to the presence of ammonia.|$|E
40|$|The <b>hydrated</b> {{electron}} is {{a unique}} solvent-supported state comprised of an excess electron that is confined to a cavity by the surrounding water. Theoretical {{studies have suggested that}} two-electron solvent-supported states also can be formed; in particular, simulations indicate that two excess electrons could pair up and occupy a single cavity, forming a so-called <b>hydrated</b> dielectron. Although <b>hydrated</b> dielectrons have not been observed directly by experiment, their existence has been posited to explain the lack of an ionic strength effect in <b>hydrated</b> electron bimolecular annihilation [Schmidt, K. H.; Bartels, D. M. Chem. Phys. 1995, 190, 145]. To determine whether dielectrons may be created in the laboratory, we use thermodynamic integration (TI), combined with mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics simulation, to examine the thermodynamic stability of <b>hydrated</b> electrons and dielectrons. For the dielectron calculations, we solve the two-electron quantum problem using full configuration interaction. Our results suggest that <b>hydrated</b> dielectrons are thermodynamically unstable relative to separated (single) <b>hydrated</b> electrons, although we also show that increasing the pressure could drive the equilibrium toward the formation of dielectrons. Because the simulations suggest that <b>hydrated</b> dielectrons are kinetically stable, we also examine a scenario for creating metstable, nonequilibrium populations of dielectrons, which involves the capture of a newly injected electron by a preexisting, equilibrated <b>hydrated</b> electron. These calculations, which allow for the full nonadiabatic relaxation of the injected electron, show that <b>hydrated</b> electrons may indeed act as trapping sites for unequilibrated electrons, so that capture may be a viable mechanism for creating dielectrons. We suggest possible experimental procedures to create such nonequilibrium <b>hydrated</b> dielectrons using either pulse radiolysis or ultrafast spectroscopic techniques. I...|$|R

Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).
