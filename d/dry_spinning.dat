40|$|We {{demonstrated}} {{the replacement of}} the Pt catalyst normally used in the counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) by a nanocomposite of <b>dry</b> <b>spun</b> carbon multi-walled nanotube (MWNT) sheets with graphene flakes (Gr-F). The effectiveness of this counter electrode on the reduction of the triiodide in the iodide/triiodide redox (I−/I− 3) redox reaction was studied in parallel {{with the use of the}} <b>dry</b> <b>spun</b> carbon MWNT sheets alone and graphene flakes used independent of each other. This nanocomposite deposited onto fluorinated tin-oxide-coated glass showed improved catalytic behavior and power conversion efficiency (7. 55 %) beyond the use of the MWNTs alone (6. 62 %) or graphene alone (4. 65 %) for the triiodide reduction reaction in DSSC. We also compare the use of the carbon MWNT/Gr-F composite counter electrode with a DSSC using the standard Pt counter electrode (8. 8 %). The details of increased performance of graphene/MWNT composite electrodes as studied are discussed in terms of increased catalytic activity permitted by sharp atomic edges that arise from the structure of graphene flakes or the defect sites in the carbon MWNT and increased electrical conductivity between the carbon MWNT bundles by the graphene flakes...|$|R

50|$|After it is formed, {{cellulose}} acetate is dissolved in acetone into a viscous resin for extrusion through spinnerets (which resemble a shower head).

50|$|Spandex fibers are {{produced}} in four different ways: melt extrusion, reaction spinning, solution <b>dry</b> <b>spinning,</b> and solution wet spinning. All {{of these methods}} include the initial step of reacting monomers to produce a prepolymer. Once the prepolymer is formed, it is reacted further in various ways and drawn out to make the fibers.|$|E
50|$|Before drawing, polymer melt {{is pushed}} through a die {{with a large}} number of small holes, known as a spinneret. Typically, the fibers are air cooled without any need for curing. If curing is needed, two methods are available: dry and wet spinning. In wet spinning, the polymer is {{dissolved}} and extruded through a spinneret into a chemical bath. In <b>dry</b> <b>spinning,</b> a solvent is allowed to evaporate as the fibers are cooled.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>spinning</b> is {{also used}} for {{polymers}} that must be dissolved in solvent. It differs in that the solidification is achieved through evaporation of the solvent. This is usually achieved by a stream of air or inert gas. Because there is no precipitating liquid involved, the fiber {{does not need to}} be dried, and the solvent is more easily recovered. Acetate, triacetate, acrylic, modacrylic, polybenzimidazole fiber, spandex, and vinyon are produced via this process.|$|E
50|$|Artificial fibres {{are made}} by {{extruding}} a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium. In <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometers long.|$|E
50|$|Triacetate {{is derived}} from {{cellulose}} by acetylating cellulose with acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride. Acetylation converts hydroxyl groups in cellulose to acetyl groups, which renders the cellulose polymer much more soluble in organic solvents. The cellulose acetate is dissolved {{in a mixture of}} dichloromethane and methanol for spinning. As the filaments emerge from a spinneret, the solvent is evaporated in warm air, in a process known as <b>dry</b> <b>spinning,</b> leaving a fibre of almost pure triacetate.|$|E

50|$|The {{drawing method}} makes long single strands of nanofibers {{one at a}} time. The pulling process is {{accompanied}} by solidification that converts the dissolved spinning material into a solid fiber. A cooling step is necessary {{in the case of}} melt spinning and evaporation of solvent in the case of <b>dry</b> <b>spinning.</b> A limitation, however, is that only a viscoelastic material that can undergo extensive deformations while possessing sufficient cohesion to survive the stresses developed during pulling can be made into nanofibers through this process.|$|E
50|$|Electrospinning is a fiber {{production}} method which uses electric force to draw charged threads of polymer solutions or polymer melts up to fiber diameters {{in the order}} of some hundred nanometers. Electrospinning shares characteristics of both electrospraying and conventional solution <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> of fibers. The process does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. This makes the process particularly suited to the production of fibers using large and complex molecules. Electrospinning from molten precursors is also practiced; this method ensures that no solvent can be carried over into the final product.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{possibility}} of actively balancing the spin drum in a washing machine is examined. Due {{to the fact that}} the unbalance in washing machines is highly variable, e. g. by water leaving the laundry during <b>spin</b> <b>drying,</b> active balancing is required where the balancing system continuously is changing according to how much unbalance there is to counterbalance. The idea is to use a concept which with the help of an eccentric mechanism displaces the spin drum during <b>spin</b> <b>drying,</b> thus counteract the unbalance which arises when the laundry has been unevenly distributed before <b>spin</b> <b>drying.</b> In the thesis a preliminary study in rotor dynamics has been done to examine what kind of different techniques there are for active balancing whereupon a development of other concepts to be compared to the eccentric mechanism was done. Primarily to find out if the concept already exists but also to examine if there are other concepts that could be comparable to or even better than the eccentric mechanism. The eccentric mechanism was considered to be the most potential concept. A design including the mechanical parts of the eccentric mechanism has been dimensioned to be able to use in a physical prototype and to make it possible to execute a <b>spin</b> <b>drying</b> speed of 2000 rpm without excessive vibrations. The eccentric mechanism was modelled in Pro/ENGINEER and its behaviour has been studied in a computerised model of ASKO Cylinda washing machine in ADAMS/View. Through analysis in the virtual model it was found that the model is comparable to a physical machine and the vibrations caused by the unbalance can be strongly reduced by the use of the eccentric mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|The polymer {{is formed}} by free-radical {{polymerization}} in aqueous suspension. The fiber {{is produced by}} dissolving the polymer in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or aqueous sodium thiocyanate, metering it through a multi-hole spinnerette and coagulating the resultant filaments in an aqueous solution of the same solvent (wet spinning) or evaporating the solvent in a stream of heated inert gas (<b>dry</b> <b>spinning).</b> Washing, stretching, drying and crimping complete the processing. Acrylic fibers are produced {{in a range of}} deniers, usually from 0.9 to 15, as cut staple or as a 500,000 to 1 million filament tow. End uses include sweaters, hats, hand-knitting yarns, socks, rugs, awnings, boat covers, and upholstery; the fiber is also used as [...] "PAN" [...] precursor for carbon fiber. Production of acrylic fibers is centered in the Far East, Turkey, India, Mexico, and South America, though a number of European producers still continue to operate, including Dralon and Fisipe. US producers have ended production (except for specialty uses such as in friction materials, gaskets, specialty papers, conductive, and stucco), though acrylic tow and staple are still spun into yarns in the USA.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project documented here {{was to develop a}} brine-gel process for the fabrication of #alpha#-Al_ 2 O_ 3 continuous fibers until verification of its technological capability. The work carried out comprised the development of spinnable brines and the fabrication of gel fibers by <b>dry</b> <b>spinning,</b> and the characterization of the thermal behavior of the gel fibers during the thermal cycle: drying - pyrolysis - phase transformation - sintering. In addition to this, the capabilities of controlled formation of a submicrostructure at sintering temperatures < 1, 100 C were investigated. For both approaches to spinning mass production, proof was furnished that pure aluminum oxide fibers can be fabricated by <b>dry</b> <b>spinning.</b> As far as spinning mass processing is concerned, the colloidal route proved to be the more cost-efficient process, but with regard to shaping, the <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> process, spinning masses produced via the alcoholate route exhibited a more favorable process both in terms of engineering and economy. All told the brine-gel process via alcoholate precursors is very flexible and technically mature enough to achieve the same technical standard both for the spinnable brine and for the <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> rate.

40|$|Segmented poly (urethane-urea) (SPUU) fibers such as spandex fibers {{are usually}} {{produced}} by <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> process. The processing conditions for <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> of SPUU can be optimized by computer simulation. In this work, a simulation model is {{proposed for the}} <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> process where the SPUU dope in the liquid state is first extruded from the nozzle {{in the shape of}} spinline, then the solvent in the spinline is removed by the blowing of hot gas while elongated, and finally a few spinlines come to a fiber in the solid state after they are twisted. The deformation behavior, solvent concentration, temperature of spinline and so on can be predicted with this model. Governing equations composed of the equations of continuity, motion, energy, rheology and deflection were derived under the assumption of Newtonian fluid. Simulations for <b>dry</b> <b>spinning</b> process were carried out with various diffusion coefficients previously reported for two kinds of solvents (dimethyl formamid (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMAc)) and three measurement methods of diffusion coefficients (Moiré pattern, Film and Dope methods), where Moiré pattern method gives the mutual diffusion coefficient for the liquid-liquid system, Film method gives the diffusion coefficient of solvent into the film which changes from the solid state to the semisolid state during measurement, and Dope method gives the diffusion coefficient of solvent from the dope which changes from the liquid state to the (semi-) solid state during measurement. The temperature distribution in the spinning chamber was linearly approximated in the distribution close to a practical plant. The simulation model can predict the residual solvent concentration, temperature, cross sectional area, spinning stress and deflection of spinline. The simulation results denoted that the change of solvent concentration is mainly determined in the hot gas zone even if the diffusion coefficients are different. Therefore, the deformation behavior of spinline is chiefly governed in the hot gas zone. And there is little change found in the interim zone and blowing zone...|$|E

50|$|The thermal stability, flame resistance, and {{moisture}} regain of PBI and its conventional textile processing character {{enable it to}} be processed on conventional staple fiber textile equipment. These characteristics lead {{to one of the}} most important applications of PBI: protective apparel. PBI filaments were fabricated into protective clothing like firefighters' gear and astronauts' suits. PBI filaments are <b>dry</b> <b>spun</b> from dimethylacetamide containing lithium chloride. After washing and drying the resulting yarn is golden brown. PBI fiber is an excellent candidate for applications in severe environments due to its combination of thermal, chemical and textile properties. Flame and thermal resistance are the critical properties of protective apparel. This kind of apparel applications includes firefighter’s protective apparel, astronaut’s suits, aluminized crash rescued gear, industrial worker’s apparel, and suits for racing car drivers. The problem of PBI protective apparel is that it keeps heat out but it also keeps the heat in, too. Thus, by the time the firefighters feel heat and pain, it is too late and they will get burnt or killed since it is hard for the heat to penetrate the suit and be released into the air. There are still some major fire departments have not yet switched from old fire gear to PBI due to the fear of what PBI can cause. One example is the Chicago Fire Department, which still relies on the old type of rubber or leather coats.|$|R
