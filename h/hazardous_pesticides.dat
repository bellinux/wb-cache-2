5000|$|TETS is a neurotoxin, causing lethal convulsions. Its {{effect is}} similar to but {{stronger}} than picrotoxin, a GABA-A receptor antagonist widely used in research. As {{one of the most}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides,</b> it is 100 times more toxic than potassium cyanide. TETS is a suicide inhibitor that binds irreversibly to neuronal GABA gated chloride channels, often causing status epilepticus. No antidote is known. The lethal dose for humans is 7-10 mg. Poisoning is diagnosed by GC-MS and the treatment is mainly supportive, with large doses of IV clonazepam and pyridoxine to control symptoms. TETS is sequestered in tissues of poisoned birds and can thus pose severe risk of secondary poisoning.|$|E
50|$|On International Women’s Day 2016, WECF {{launched}} its publication ‘Women and Chemicals - The impact of hazardous chemicals on women. A thought starter {{based on an}} experts workshop’. With Women and Chemicals, WECF presents a deeper look at the nexus between gender roles and women’s exposure to hazardous chemicals worldwide and it summarizes existing information and initiatives on the topic. The Report demonstrates that women are often differently exposed due to their (entrenched) gender roles and because of biological susceptibilities and health impacts. In particular, the Report proposes {{an examination of the}} impacts of highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides,</b> mercury, and endocrine disrupting chemicals on the health of women everywhere. The Report concludes with a call for more political action for better health protection from harmful chemicals for all, but in particular for women as consumers and workers. The goal is to raise awareness about what people can do for their health and how they can change their own behaviors as consumers. As Alexandra Caterbow states: “in this report we focused on women, because often men’s health impacts are already better known, from reduced sperm-counts to testicular cancer and genital malformations. We call on urgent legislative measures to better protect the health of women, men and children from hazardous chemicals. Immediate steps have to be taken to end use of highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides,</b> to phase out EDCs such as Bisphenol A from consumer products and packaging, to ban mercury use in artisanal small gold mining, and to promote the use of safer substitutes and non-chemical alternatives”.|$|E

50|$|Agriculture {{is a state}} {{responsibility}} in Lebanon, where the ministry of agriculture is involved in setting agricultural policies and regulations. In the 1990s, the Lebanese government has awarded 89 contracts in the agricultural sector worth a total of US$13.6 million and an additional 46 projects in the irrigation sector, worth US$51.8 million. Contracts include consultancy and design, as well as works and equipment supply. Capital investment in the agricultural sector includes the rehabilitation of the Ministry of Agriculture, land reclamation projects, {{as well as the}} rehabilitation of agricultural schools and research stations. The agricultural sector is struggling to survive in a competitive regional market. Through loans and grant agreements, the government has implemented large-scale irrigation projects and has taken steps to ban a long list of <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides.</b> However, there are many problems facing the agricultural development with effective extension programs, use of water-conserving irrigation techniques, and rational use of agro-chemicals still scant or localized.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{pesticide}} poisoning is a {{major public}} health problem in Sri Lanka. In several agricultural districts, it precedes all other causes of death in government hospitals. Most of the acute poisoning cases are intentional (suicide) and occur among young adults, mainly males. Poisoning due to occupational exposure is also common, but less well documented. In an irrigation area in Sri Lanka a very high incidence of serious pesticide poisoning was observed, with 68 % due to intentional ingestion of liquid pesticides. It is argued that the easy availability and widespread use of highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{is the most important}} reason for this high number of poisoning cases. The frequent application of highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> in high concentrations was often irrational and posed serious health and financial risks to the farmers. Sales promotion activities and credit facilities promoted this excessive pesticide use, which was not counteracted by an agricultural extension service. Hazardous practices when spraying pesticides were due to the impossibility of applying recommended protective measures under the local conditions, rather than to lack of knowledge. Current emphasis on programs that promote the safe use of pesticides through education and training of farmers will be ineffective in Sri Lanka because knowledge is already high and most poisoning cases are intentional. Instead, enforcement of legislation to restrict availability of the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> would result in an immediate health benefit. Improved agricultural extension services to promote alternative non-chemical methods of pest control is the most important strategy, in the long term, to prevent acute pesticide poisoning.

30|$|Alachlor, Bromacil and Diuron are {{herbicides}} {{widely used}} for weed control {{all over the}} world. Alachlor is a chloroacetanilide herbicide, used to control annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds in fields of corn, soybeans and peanuts. It inhibits protein synthesis in plant roots (Walker and Lawrence 1992). Bromacil belongs to Uracil family of herbicides used for brush control on non-cropland areas. It is especially useful against perennial grasses and used for selective weed control in pineapple and citrus crops (Redondo 1997). Diuron, {{one of the most}} commonly used herbicides, belongs to Urea derivatives that are applied in pre-emergence and post-emergence to control broadleaf weeds {{in a wide variety of}} annual and perennial broadleaf and grass weeds (Field et al. 1997; Gooddy et al. 2002). It has been classified as a slightly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticide</b> by WHO (USEPA 1994; Malato et al. 2002).

40|$|Background: Methyl {{parathion}} is classed as {{an extremely}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticide</b> with a rodent LD 50 of 6 to 24 mg/kg. It has been banned in numerous countries, {{but there are}} few reports of acute methyl parathion poisoning. Methods: Plasma cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase were measured in blood. Methyl parathion and the major metabolite 4 -nitrophenol where measured in serum and urine. Based on the available concentration-time data, the pharmacokinetic parameters of methyl parathion were estimated for this patient. Case Report and Results: A 29 -year-old male ingested 50 to 100 mL (12 to 24 g) of methyl parathion causing delayed and prolonged suppression of acetylcholinesterase but almost no clinical effects. Absorption was predicted to last for 30 hours and the bioavailability appeared to be very low. Conclusions: Although it is feasible the patient ingested much less, a tenth of his alleged ingestion dose {{is more than the}} oral LD in rats. Methyl parathion appears to be less toxic in humans than parathion for similar amounts ingested, which is not consistent with the two pesticides having similar rodent LD...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{endosulfan}} pesticides {{in agriculture}} can cause environmental problems, such as pollution in aquatic environments {{that can lead}} to destruction of fishery resources and drinking water. So, it has become imperative to detect and separate the <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticide</b> endosulfan from contaminated water. In this work, molecularly imprinted membrane has been fabricated for the specific recognition by using methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) as cross linker. The molecular imprinting of endosulfan on membrane matrix was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This was followed by sensing of the endosulfan by voltammetry. The electrochemical potential is additional information enhancing the selectivity of the sensor. It can be concluded that MIP-based voltammetric sensors are very promising analytical tool for the development of highly selective analytical sensor. The test results of electrode performance indicated that MIP endosulfan-based aluminum-carbon sensor had detection limit of 0. 02 mM, sensitive in the concentration range from 0. 02 to 0. 12 mM with Nernst factor > 0. 059 V/decade and had good stability.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pesticide use {{raises a}} number of {{environmental}} concerns.

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{effective}} mechanism for measuring {{the potential benefits of}} integrated pest and disease interventions in terms of reducing pesticide risks in potato production in developing countries. The environmental impact quotient (EIQ), a composite hazard indicator, was applied to data from potato field trials implemented in Ecuador to evaluate the practical boundaries of this metric related to potato production practices in the Andes. The EIQ was also applied to data from two independent farmer surveys, one from Peru and one from Ecuador to compare potato farming practices and the utility of the EIQ when applied to existing survey data. In the Ecuadorian field trials, the EIQ values, i. e., environmental impact (EI) per ha, varied greatly among the different potato systems tested and ranged from 40 for an integrated pest management system (resistant cultivar plus less <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides)</b> to 1235 for a high-input conventional system (susceptible cultivar plus frequent use of <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides).</b> Thus, this parameter demonstrates substantial variation under different conditions and different crop management approaches. EI per ha values from the two surveys fell within the range found in the field trial, but in the survey values were toward the lower end, ranging from 64 to 213. Methodical and biophysical factors are discussed that may account for the relatively low EI per ha found in the field survey data. Our study demonstrates the utility of the EIQ for assessing health and environmental hazards of potato production in the Andes and potentially other areas in the developing world. Nonetheless, there are limitations to the EIQ as presently used and care is needed in the interpretation of results. We see our work as an initial step in the development of an integrated metric to estimate environmental and human health hazards related to pesticide use in potato production in the diverse conditions of developing countries...|$|E
30|$|The FSC {{criteria}} for rating of herbicides as highly hazardous changed in 2015.

There is continued interest in New Zealand in the potential of non-residual herbicides for effective forest weed control because of the generally dynamic nature of pesticide regulations globally at present. This interest is partly attributed to the requirement for certified forest growers to continually strive to reduce dependence on the use of herbicides for weed control.|$|E
