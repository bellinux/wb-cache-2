40|$|Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{is a high}} {{incidence}} cancer affecting many Canadian adults each year. Diet {{is important in the}} etiology of CRC with many dietary components identified as potential risk factors. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is a well-established pattern to characterize overall eating. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize a <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern</b> within the Canadian context and to assess its relationship to the risk of CRC in Canadian adults. Methods: Unconditional multiple logistic regression with control for confounding variables was performed using data from the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance Study. Dietary intake was captured for this case-control study through a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and categorized into a DASH score ranging from 0 to 10 representing a poor to a strong <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern</b> respectively. Results: Consuming a strong <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern</b> of eating (score ≥ 8) was not common in the 3161 cases and 3097 controls. Overall, only 10. 8 % of men and 13. 6 % of women had a strong <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern.</b> Multivariate analysis demonstrated a trend for decreasing risk of CRC in men with increasing DASH scores (p value for trend =. 007). Men with a strong DASH score had a 33 % reduction in risk of CRC compared to those with a low DASH score. There were no significant trends for women for CRC or for colon or rectal cancers separately. Conclusion: Our findings are similar to other researchers suggesting a benefit with a strong <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern</b> associated with a decreased risk of CRC, especially in men. Research should further investigate our gender-based differences...|$|E

This study examined the risk of incident hypertension associated with dietary patterns in 8, 552 women in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) -Potsdam Study. The baseline examination was carried out between 1994 and 1998. During 2 – 4 years of follow-up (through May 15, 2002), 123 incident hypertension cases were verified by medical records. Two exploratory dietary patterns, a “traditional cooking” pattern (meat, cooked vegetables, sauce, potatoes, and poultry) and a “fruits and vegetables ” pattern (fruits, raw vegetables, and vegetable oil), were identified by exploratory factor analysis and confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. Additionally, a hypothesis-oriented pattern based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Study was defined (fruits, vegetables, and milk products). Patterns ’ associations with disease risk were estimated by Cox regression. While no significant associations were observed for the traditional cooking pattern or the fruits and vegetables pattern after adjustment for potential confounders, women in the third quartile of the <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern</b> were at lower risk than women in the lowest quartile (hazard rate ratio = 0. 51, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 29, 0. 89).

40|$|Hypertension is a known {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease in adults. Essential hypertension {{in children and adolescents}} is increasing in prevalence in the United States, and hypertension in children may track into adulthood. This increasing prevalence is attributed to the trends of increasing overweight and obese children and adolescents. Family history and being of African-American/black descent may predispose youth to elevated blood pressure. Interventions targeted to reduce and treat hypertension in youth include non-pharmaceutical interventions such as weight reduction, increased physical activity, and dietary changes and pharmaceutical treatment when indicated. The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is well documented in adults, but there are limited studies with regards to children and adolescents, specifically in the arena of dietary interventions. Lifestyle modifications such as dietary interventions are the mainstay of recommended treatment for those children and adolescents with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. Given the association of being overweight and hypertension, efficacy of dietary interventions are of interest because of reduced cost, easy implementation and potential for multiple beneficial outcomes such as reduced weight and reduction of other metabolic or cardiovascular derangements. Barriers to dietary interventions often include socioeconomic status, ethnicity, personal, and external factors. The goal of this systematic review of the literature is to identify interventions targeted to children and adolescents that focus on recommended dietary changes related to blood pressure. Dietary interventions found for this review mostly focused on a particular nutrient or food group with the one notable exception that focused on the <b>DASH</b> <b>pattern</b> of eating. The effects of the interventions on blood pressure varied, but overall dietary modifications can be achieved in youth and can serve a role in producing positive outcomes on blood pressure. Increasing potassium and following a DASH diet seemed to provide the most clinically significant results. Further studies are still needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness and to contribute more supporting evidence for particular modifications in these age cohorts. ...|$|E

Healthy {{eating is}} one of the {{priorities}} in diabetes management, suggesting that the quality of an eating pattern is linked to the prognosis of the disease. This dissertation aimed to develop a dietary index that informs the course of diabetes management while being applicable {{to a wide range of}} research purposes. A new dietary index was developed based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (<b>DASH)</b> eating <b>pattern</b> that has been shown to decrease blood pressure. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 - 2008 and 2009 - 2010, the performance of the new index was evaluated by estimating the concordance with the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern</b> among US adults with diabetes and diabetes-related health conditions. This dissertation consists of three cross-sectional studies examining the concordance with the DASH eating pattern: the first study by blood pressure status; the second by diabetes status, and; the third by cardiovascular disease risk status. The findings from the three studies suggest that following the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern</b> may be beneficial for adults with diabetes. These studies also reveal a consistent pattern in the degree of concordance with the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern</b> between the total index scores of the new index and the established DASH indices.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{determine}} the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (<b>DASH)</b> eating <b>pattern</b> on cardiometabolic risks in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A randomized crossover clinical trial was undertaken in 31 type 2 diabetic patients. For 8 weeks, participants were randomly assigned to a control diet or the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern.</b> RESULTS — After following the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern,</b> body weight (P � 0. 007) and waist circumference (P � 0. 002) reduced significantly. Fasting blood glucose levels and A 1 C decreased after adoption of the DASH diet (� 29. 4 � 6. 3 mg/dl; P � 0. 04 and � 1. 7 � 0. 1 %; P � 0. 04, respectively). After the DASH diet, the mean change for HDL cholesterol levels was higher (4. 3 � 0. 9 mg/dl; P � 0. 001) and LDL cholesterol was reduced (� 17. 2 � 3. 5 mg/dl; P � 0. 02). Additionally, DASH had beneficial effects on systolic (� 13. 6 � 3. 5 vs. � 3. 1 � 2. 7 mmHg; P � 0. 02) and diastolic blood pressure (� 9. 5 � 2. 6 vs. � 0. 7 � 3. 3 mmHg; P � 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS — Among diabetic patients, the DASH diet had beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risks. Cardiovascular complications are the most frequent problem among type 2 diabetic patients (1). Therefore, a therapeutic approach that can control cardiometabolic risks might have beneficial effects for diabetic patients (2). Although the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was originally developed to prevent or treat high blood pressure (2), it is now recommended as an ideal eating pattern for all adults (3).

The DASH diet consisted of 52 carbohydrates, 18 proteins, and 30 total fats. It was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. Sodium content of the DASH diet was designed to be less than 2 400 mg/day. The control diet was also designed to contain 52 carbohydrates, 18 protein, and 30 total fat. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8 weeks intervention to measure insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP levels. Adherence to the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern,</b> compared to the control diet, resulted in a significant reduction of serum insulin levels (- 1. 88 vs. 2. 89 Î¼IU/ml, p= 0. 03), HOMA-IR score (- 0. 45 vs. 0. 80; p= 0. 01), and serum hs-CRP levels (- 763. 29 vs. 665. 95 ng/ml, p= 0. 009).

A formula for the number of permutations of length n that can be sorted by passing it twice through a stack (where the letters on the stack have to be in increasing order) was conjectured by West, and later proved by Zeilberger. Goulden and West found a bijection from such permutations to nonseparable planar maps, and later, Jacquard and Schaeffer presented a bijection from these planar maps to certain labeled plane trees, called β(1, 0) -tree. Using generating trees, Dulucq, Gire and West showed that nonseparable planar maps are equinumerous with permutations avoiding the (classical) pattern 2413 and the barred pattern 413 ¯ 52; they called these permutations nonseparable. We give a new bijection between β(1, 0) -tree and permutations avoiding the <b>dashed</b> <b>patterns</b> 3 - 1 - 4 - 2 and 2 - 41 - 3. These permutations can be seen to be exactly the reverse of nonseparable permutations. Our bijection is built using decompositions of the permutations and the trees, and it translates seven statistics on the trees into statistics on the permutations. Among the statistics involved are ascents, left-to-right minima and right-to-left maxima for the permutations, and leaves and the rightmost and leftmost paths for the trees. In connection with this we give a nontrivial involution on the β(1, 0) -tree, which specializes to an involution on unlabeled rooted plane trees, where it yields interesting results. Lastly, we conjecture the existence of a bijection between nonseparable permutations and two-stack sortable permutations preserving at least four permutation statistics...|$|R

Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control diet (n 17) or the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern</b> (n 17) for 4 weeks. The control diet was designed to contain 45 - 55 carbohydrates, 15 - 20 protein and 25 - 30 total fat. The macronutrient composition of the DASH diet was similar to the control diet; however, the DASH diet was rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products, and contained lower amounts of saturated fats, cholesterol and refined grains with a total of 2400 mg Na/d. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose, glycated Hb (HbA 1 c) and lipid profiles. Participants underwent a 3 h oral glucose tolerance tests and blood samples were collected at 60, 120 and 180 min to measure plasma glucose levels. Adherence to the <b>DASH</b> eating <b>pattern,</b> compared with the control diet, resulted in improved glucose tolerance such that plasma glucose levels reduced at 60 (- 1 Â· 86 v. - 0 Â· 45 mmol/l, P group= 0 Â· 02), 120 (- 2 Â· 3 v. 0 Â· 2 mmol/l, P group= 0 Â· 001) and 180 min (- 1 Â· 7 v. 0 Â· 22 mmol/l, P group= 0 Â· 002) after the glucose load. Decreased HbA 1 c levels (- 0 Â· 2 v. 0 Â· 05, P group= 0 Â· 001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. Mean changes for serum total (- 0 Â· 42 v. 0 Â· 31 mmol/l, P group= 0 Â· 01) and LDL-cholesterol (- 0 Â· 47 v. 0 Â· 22 mmol/l, P group= 0 Â· 005), TAG (- 0 Â· 17 v. 0 Â· 34 mmol/l, P group= 0 Â· 01) and total:HDL-cholesterol ratio (- 0 Â· 6 (sd 0 Â· 9) v. 0 Â· 3 (sd 0 Â· 8), P group= 0 Â· 008) were significantly different between the two diets.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We {{evaluated}} the association of the DASH diet with incidence of type 2 diabetes among 862 participants of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) who completed a 1 -year food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Type 2 diabetes odds ratios (ORs) were estimated at tertiles of the DASH score. RESULTS — An inverse association was observed in whites (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, OR 0. 66 [95 % CI 0. 29 – 1. 48]) that became significant for the most extreme contrast (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 0. 31 [0. 13 – 0. 75]), with adjustment for covariates. No association was observed in blacks or Hispanics (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, 1. 16 [0. 61 – 2. 18]; tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 1. 34 [0. 70 – 2. 58]).

Caution should be exercised before initiating the DASH diet in patients with chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and those who are prescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonist, but these conditions are not strict contraindications to DASH. Modifications to the DASH diet may be necessary to facilitate its use in patients with chronic heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, lactose intolerance, and celiac disease. In general, the DASH diet can be adopted by most patient populations and initiated simultaneously with medication therapy and other lifestyle interventions...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relation between hypertension (HTN) status and the amount of sodium purchased and consumed by community dwelling older adults. The secondary objective was to compare their accordance with the <b>DASH</b> dietary <b>pattern</b> according to hypertension status. Method: A dietary survey of 30 community dwelling older adults was conducted. The amount of daily sodium purchased and consumed, DASH score and DASH accordance were compared between the hypertensive and normotensive older adults using grocery receipts and 24 -hour dietary recall. Participants’ knowledge, concern and behaviour regarding dietary sodium were also assessed using a researcher administered study questionnaire. Result: There was no significant difference in both the amount of sodium purchased (p = 0. 07) and consumed (p = 0. 61) by the older adults with and without hypertension. Older adults with HTN had significantly lower DASH scores (DASH score = 1. 8) than those without HTN (DASH score = 4. 3) (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), with only 6. 3...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are {{characterized}} by higher intake of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and unsaturated fatty acids. All of these foods and nutrients may affect cholesterol, inflammation, the development of atherosclerosis, and, therefore, risk of cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: Our objective {{was to examine the}} association between the Mediterranean and <b>DASH</b> dietary <b>patterns</b> and risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in women. DESIGN: We used a prospective cohort of 93, 122 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative study between 1993 and 1998 and followed for an average of 10. 5 y. Women completed a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) twice during follow-up. We scored their diets according to how closely the reported diet resembled each dietary pattern. SCD was defined as death that occurred within 1 h of symptom onset. RESULTS: A higher Mediterranean diet score was associated with lower risk of SCD (HR: 0. 64; 95...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Eating meals {{away from}} home has been {{associated}} with the consumption of unhealthy foods and increased body weight. However, more rigorous assessment of the contribution of different types of away-from-home food establishments to overall diet quality and obesity is minimal. This study examined usage of these food establishments, accordance to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (<b>DASH)</b> dietary <b>pattern</b> and obesity status in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data from a national survey (N= 2, 083 aged ≥ 19 years, from 2008 to 2012) with dietary intake measured using a 4 -day food diary, and height and weight measured objectively. Exposures included usage of (i. e., by proportion of energy) all away-from-home food establishments combined, and fast-food outlets, restaurants, and cafés separately. Outcomes included accordance with the DASH diet, and obesity status. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted in 2016 to estimate associations between food establishments, diet quality, and obesity. Results: People consuming a higher proportion of energy from any away-from-home food establishment had lower odds of DASH accordance (OR= 0. 45, 95...|$|R
40|$|Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV, EC 3. 4. 14. 5) {{together}} with fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP), DPP- 7, - 8 and - 9 {{belong to the}} functionally defined group of "DPP-IV activity and/or structure homologues" (DASH). They hydrolyse N-terminal X-Pro dipeptides {{from a number of}} biologically active peptides like neuropeptide Y, substance P and chemokines such as stromal cell derived factor- 1 alpha (SDF- 1). Limited proteolysis of such mediators by DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity can modify consequent biological responses of the target cells. By that, DASH molecules are supposed to be important for multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, malignant transformation, migration and invasion and thus involved in cancer development and progression. This study was set up to characterise <b>DASH</b> expression <b>pattern</b> and DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity in human astrocytic tumours in comparison with non-tumorous brain tissue, and to assess its context with the expression of receptors of some local mediators- DASH substrates implicated in gliomagenesis. Moreover, the possible functional relevance of DASH molecules in growth properties of transformed astrocytic cells was studied in model of primary cell cultures derived from the glioblastoma in vitro. ( [...] .) Hence we speculate that although the upregulated DPP-IV [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet {{has been}} {{recognized}} as effective to lower blood pressure in feeding trials, but compliance with the diet must be persistent to maximize health benefits in clinical practice. This paper reports a systematic review of the latest evidence on the method to assess DASH compliance and the corresponding patients' compliance in interventional settings. Methods The databases including MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus were searched for original research studies published {{in the period of}} January 1992 - December 2012 that evaluated compliance with DASH diet. Studies written in English language, with DASH intervention, with complete documentation of the degree of DASH compliance and the assessment method used were included in this review. The search terms included: dietary approaches to stop hypertension, DASH, compliance, adherence, consistency, and concordance. Results Nine studies were included. Different types of interventions were identified, ranging from feeding trial to dietary counseling. These studies differed in the assessment methods used to evaluate DASH compliance, which included objective approaches like measurement of urinary excretion, and subjective approaches like dietary intake assessment for DASH target comparison and construction of DASH scoring systems. Compliance levels were lower in educational interventions than that of the original DASH feeding trial. Conclusions To conclude, although no consensus existed regarding the best approach to assess DASH compliance, its suboptimal compliance warrants attention. This study implied a need to investigate effective approaches to sustain the <b>DASH</b> dietary <b>pattern</b> beyond counselling alone. </p...|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} {{features a}} 2+2 seating configuration, which utilizes low mounted front seats. The rear seats fold down enabling increased storage space for larger items. Three interior variations exist, the FR-S and base 86 models have cloth seats with all black interior trim {{that features a}} black <b>patterned</b> <b>dash</b> trim, while the shift boot features red stitching. [...] The BRZ has two available interiors, one identical to the FR-S but with silver dash trim, a red stitched parking brake boot, black gauge faces (instead of the white tachometer of the 86 GTS models) and a touch-screen navigation head unit; the second option upgrades to leather and Alcantara heated seats, automatic HVAC controls, and a push-button start. The top-of-the-range 86 models are fitted like the BRZ except as noted above, and the Japanese interior can be had in black/red leather and Alcantara or full black leather and Alcantara (Australia being offered only the latter).|$|R
