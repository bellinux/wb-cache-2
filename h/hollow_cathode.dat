In gas flow sputtering a working gas like argon is led through an opening in a metal subjected to a negative electrical potential. Enhanced plasma densities occur in the <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode,</b> if the pressure in the chamber p and a characteristic dimension L of the <b>hollow</b> <b>cathode</b> obey the Paschen's law 0.5 Pa·m < p·L < 5 Pa·m. This causes a high flux of ions on the surrounding surfaces and a large sputter effect. The hollow-cathode based gas flow sputtering may thus be associated with large deposition rates up to values of a few µm/min.|$|E

As such, hollow-cathode thrusters may meet some limited applications. However, it is unlikely that this type of thruster could be improved significantly or could compete with similar thrusters in the same operating range. High specific impulse operation is also shown to develop large discharge voltage fluctuations, which may significantly limit the lifetime of such a device. <br/...|$|R

In addition, other expectations were to show that the mission configuration could function as an orbit-boosting motor as well as a generator, by converting orbital energy into electricity. The tether was a 500 m length of insulated 18 gauge copper wire.The mission was launched on 26 June 1993, as the secondary payload on a Delta II rocket. The total experiment lasted approximately seven hours. In that time, the results demonstrated that current is fully reversible, and therefore was capable of generating power and orbit boosting modes.

The second cathode was operated on xenon at 150 A emission current continuously for 24 hours, and for over 1000 hours at 100 A on argon with essentially no change in the cathode operating characteristics. Operation of this cathode was terminated due to severe erosion of several discharge chamber components located downstream of the cathode.
