5|$|<b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at <b>Guinea</b> <b>Fowl,</b> just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at <b>Guinea</b> <b>Fowl,</b> he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia was {{the last}} of the Commonwealth {{countries}} to enter the Empire Air Training Scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots. No.25 Elementary Flying Training School at Belvedere Air Station, Salisbury, was the first school to be opened, on 25 May 1940 by Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. It was followed by a Service School at Cranborne. In Bulawayo, an Elementary School was established at Sauerdale, although due to the unsuitability of the ground surface, it was moved to Induna, with a Service School at Kumalo. Gwelo had an Elementary School at <b>Guinea</b> <b>Fowl</b> and a Service School at Thornhill. The Elementary Schools were equipped with Tiger Moths and the Service Schools, single-engine Harvards and twin-engine Airspeed Oxfords. At Moffat, the first gunners passed out in September 1941 from the only Bombing and Gunnery School in Southern Rhodesia.|$|E

A total of 50 fresh eggs were collected from the two species. Standard measures {{were used to determine}} physical and chemical characteristics. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs were significantly (P < 0. 01) lower in egg weight, egg length, and egg diameter than Bovans'. There {{were no significant differences in}} shape index, while the specific gravity, shell weight and shell thickness of <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs were significantly (P< 0. 01) higher. Yolk and albumen weights of <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs showed significantly (P< 0. 01) lower values, while the albumen height, Haugh units and membrane weight were not different. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggss tended to have a high percentage of egg yolk and eggshell and lower percentage of egg albumen than Bovans'. Albumen and yolk of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower. Ash, nitrogen-free extract and moisture content of eggs of the two breeds were similar.

The trachea of moa were supported by many small rings of bone known as tracheal rings.

25|$|In 1840 Jonker Afrikaner {{established}} an Orlam settlement at Windhoek. He {{and his followers}} stayed {{near one of the}} main hot springs, located in the present-day Klein Windhoek suburb. He built a stone church that held 500 people; it was also used as a school. Two Rhenish missionaries, Carl Hugo Hahn and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt, started working there in late 1842. Two years later they were driven out by two Methodist Wesleyans, Richard Haddy and Joseph Tindall. Gardens were laid out and for a while Windhoek prospered. Wars between the Nama and Herero peoples eventually destroyed the settlement. After a long absence, Hahn visited Windhoek again in 1873 and was dismayed to see that nothing remained of the town's former prosperity.

40|$|Despite the {{potentials}} {{and contributions}} of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> to {{economic and social}} life in Ghana, accurate sex identification in these birds is still a major problem. Three hundred and sixty <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> (180 birds per sex) were used in determining a more accurate and farmer friendly sexing technique. The sexing methods explored were vent, biometric, and molecular techniques. Vent sexing was accomplished by measuring phalli in 28 and 32 -week-old birds, while biometric sexing involved the measurement of morphometric traits and data analyzed using discriminant function analysis. Molecular sexing {{was carried out by}} DNA extraction and subsequent PCR using the 2550 F/ 2718 R primer set. Females had a wider (P &# 60; 0. 05) pelvic inlet than male birds from first week of age {{until the end of the}} study, while the opposite was true for wattle length. However, wattle length differed (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05) between both sexes after 4 weeks of age. Combining the biometric variables in a discriminant function, males could be distinguished from females with an accuracy of 94 %. During molecular sexing, the P 2 /P 8 primer set was not effective in sexing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> because it amplified a single band in both sexes and in the same manner. The sex of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> was properly determined using the primer set 2550 F/ 2718 R. Females produced 2 bands of 396 bp and 344 bp, while males only produced the larger band. Phallus size in the 2 sexes were distinguishable from 8 weeks of age, with males having longer and thicker (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05) phalli than their female counterparts. Combining the 2 variables in a discriminate function, males and females could be distinguished with 98. 3 % accuracy.
