5|$|An Australian POW {{that was}} freed in the raid, Private Walter Gossner of the 2/15th Battalion, {{provided}} an extremely {{detailed account of}} his experiences about {{being part of a}} group of 87 POWs freed by Partisans from a location near Ožbalt. He gives the date of the raid as 27 September 1944, four weeks after the date given by Churches. <b>His</b> <b>account</b> has been posted on the internet by his family. Gossner states that he arrived at Semič 21 days after the raid, and <b>his</b> <b>account</b> varies significantly from that of Churches. It is not known why Gossner's dates and other details of <b>his</b> <b>account</b> differ so markedly from Churches' account.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of tulip mania {{began with the}} book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. <b>His</b> <b>account</b> was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of <b>his</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, <b>his</b> <b>account</b> of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinchliffe, {{this is an}} {{incorrect}} statement. Hinchliffe based <b>his</b> <b>account</b> on Rumpelhardt's testimony who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt was released on 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, ill with a combination of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air Technical Intelligence (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. Here they conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; <b>his</b> <b>account</b> of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although <b>his</b> <b>account</b> most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|Ctesias, {{who wrote}} a history of Persia based on Persian archives, claimed there were 120,000 Persian and 7,000 Greek soldiers, but <b>his</b> <b>account</b> is {{generally}} garbled (for instance, placing this battle before Salamis, he also says there were only 300 Spartans, 1000 perioeci and 6000 from the other cities at Plataea, perhaps confusing it with Thermopylae).|$|E

He based <b>his</b> <b>account</b> on specimens obtained from Jamaica, though no type specimens were designated.

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason.

Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E

For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable.
