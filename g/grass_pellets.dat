40|$|The {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{patterns}} of plasma/serum triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL) and cholesteryl esters (CE) of captive and free-ranging black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis) were investigated. Free-ranging animals (n = 28) stemmed from four different regions. Captive animals sampled included specimens from North American (n = 11) and three different European facilities (n = 6). The European animals were tested on 1 - 4 different diets, {{resulting in a}} total of 15 blood samples. Regardless of differences between the free-ranging animals from different regions, differences between captive and free-ranging animals were relatively uniform: captive animals had higher overall proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), due to levels of linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2 n 6) that were drastically increased as compared to free-ranging animals. In contrast, levels of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3 n 3) were consistently lower on conventional zoo diets. n 6 /n 3 ratios for TG, PL and CE were 1. 6, 10 and 8 in samples from free-ranging animals, respectively, as compared to 4. 1 - 16. 3, 16 - 148 and 40 - 277 in samples from captive animals. There was a distinct correlation between the proportion of grain-based products (commercial concentrates, plain grains and bread) in the diets of the European animals and the measured levels of n 6 PUFA. An animal from a facility with a very low proportion of grain products in the diet nevertheless had high LA readings, most probably due to the use of sunflower oil as 2 % (dry matter basis) of its diet. One animal that received a high proportion of <b>grass</b> meal <b>pellets</b> due to an oral disease had increased ALA contents after the diet change. These results allow conclusions on the suitability of diets fed in captivity: the black rhinoceros is prone to several uncommon diseases that have been suspected to be linked to oxidative damage, possibly due to the disposition of this species to excessive iron storage. An unnatural dietary loading with PUFAs would exacerbate this problem. Additionally, n 6 FAs are known as precursors of pro-inflammatory mediators, and their overrepresentation could therefore exacerbate any inflammatory processes. Therefore, the current practice of using grain-based feeds as major ingredients in captive rhinoceros diets is discouraged. Diet items containing ALA (a precursor of anti-inflammatory mediators) such as, fresh grass, fresh browse, the respective silages should be included at higher levels in diets for captive black rhinoceroses. <b>Grass</b> meal <b>pellets,</b> although a good source of ALA and linked with high levels of ALA in an animal of this study, must be chosen with care for black rhinoceroses due to their particular proneness for high iron contents...|$|R

40|$|HA {{reduction}} in food intake is a prominent feature of many infectious diseases. However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} of parasite-induced anorexia in sheep are poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypotheses (a) {{that the degree of}} parasite-induced anorexia in lambs is influenced by their growth potential and (b) that nematode infection results in elevated plasma leptin concentration in lambs. The hypotheses were tested with Suffolk x Greyface (S) and Scottish Black-face (B) lambs that are known to differ in their growth potential (S lambs are of greater growth potential than B lambs). During a primary parasite infection, 24 out of 48 lambs per breed were trickle-infected with 7, 000 infective Teladorsagia circumcincta larvae per day, 3 d/wk, for a period of 12 wk (experiment I). The lambs were then dewormed, and after a 2 -wk interval, half of the 24 lambs per breed that were previously infected were reinfected for another 12 wk with the same parasite and dose as used in the primary infection (experiment II). In both experiments, infected lambs were fed <b>grass</b> <b>pellets</b> for ad libitum intake, whereas noninfected lambs were fed <b>grass</b> <b>pellets</b> for either ad libitum or restricted intakes. The S lambs were more susceptible than B lambs to nematode infection, as judged from the differences in fecal egg counts (P = 0. 007). Parasitized lambs of the more susceptible breed (S) showed anorexia [i. e., a decrease in intake of 13 % compared with uninfected controls (P = 0. 01) ], whereas no significant {{reduction in}} food intake was observed in lambs of the more resistant breed (B). Reexposure to nematode infection of previously infected animals tended to result in renewed anorexia in S lambs but not in B lambs (P = 0. 08) in a similar extent as during primary infection. Plasma leptin concentrations did not differ between ad libitum-fed infected and control lambs but were greater in infected than in noninfected lambs at a similar level of food intake during both the primary (P = 0. 02) and the secondary parasitic infection (P = 0. 004) in both breeds. The results show that leptin may be involved in the response of lambs to infection but that it is unlikely that leptin alone is responsible for the parasite-induced anorexia in lambs...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Heat-related energy {{applications}} {{represent the}} largest energy demand in industrialized countries. Bioheat from densifying fast-growing energy <b>grasses</b> into fuel <b>pellets</b> {{represents one of}} the most economically efficient means to displace petroleum-based fuels and create a greenhouse gas-friendly heating fuel. The energy balance for switchgrass pellets in Ontario has been estimated at 14 : 1, distinctly superior to corn ethanol, switchgrass ethanol and biodiesel. Historically, the major constraint to the development of grasses for bioheat has been the difficultly associated with burning grasses in conventional boilers. These technical problems now appear to be largely resolved. Plant breeding and crop management can be used to reduce the chlorine, alkali and silica content in grasses, reducing clinker formation and corrosion. A new approach to optimize biomass yield and quality through fall mowing and spring harvesting appears highly promising. Utilizing advanced combustion systems which are specifically designed to burn high-ash fuels can also help resolve the problem of ash removal from boilers. In 2006 / 2007, Canadian farmers planted approximately 800 ha of switchgrass and other warm-season grasses to expand the resource base for producing agro-pellets. The main market emerging for agro-pellets is commercial heating applications, particularly the greenhouse and food processing sector and export markets to Western Europe...|$|R

In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} different ways of thermal processing (pelleting, expanding, toasting) of barley and maize on the degradative behaviour of their starch and protein in the rumen of lactating dairy cows are described. In situ studies showed that all thermal processing methods increased the ruminal starch and protein availability of maize, while all thermal processing methods decreased ruminal starch availability but only pelleting increased ruminal protein availability of barley. Based on in vivo experiments compared to untreated grains, expander treatment increased the apparent rumen and total tract digestibility of maize starch but {{did not affect the}} digestibility of barley starch. Supplementing grazing dairy cows with pelleted and pressure toasted maize and barley slightly (not significantly) decreased the dry matter intake of grass in the first grazing event in the morning after milking, and it decreased ruminal clearence of nitrogen. Supplementing pasture <b>grass</b> with <b>pelleted</b> and pressure toasted cereal grains decreased the pH, the NH 3 -N level in the rumen, the ammonia to total VFA (TVFA) ratio, the isobutyrate proportion, the acetate to propionate ratio and the non-glucogenic to glucogenic ratio in the rumen. Simultaneously it increased TVFA concentrations, propionate, butyrate and valerate proportions {{as a percentage of the}} TVFA. All processed grains did affect production responses in dairy cows, by elevating milk protein and decreasing milk fat production, and milk urea nitrogen but no significant differences between these two heat treatments were found. It is concluded that the need of synchrony is specially important with diets based on fresh grass, in which markedly asynchronous rates of release of energy and nitrogen occur in the rumen. It appears that to generate a better ruminal N and organic matter synchrony to improve microbial N yield and N utilization feeding different types of cereal grain that differ by nature in rate and extent of ruminal degradation has more effect than using one of this processing methods on the same type of grain. Responses obtained from cereal grain supplementation are very dependent on the quality and degradation characteristics of the pasture consumed, which changes through the grazing season. </TR...|$|R
40|$|The high {{contents}} of disadvantageous elements contained in non-woody biomass {{are known to}} cause problems during small and large scale combustion, typically resulting in {{a higher risk of}} slagging, corrosion, and increased emissions.

The florafuel process used here is comprised of size reduction followed by washing and subsequent mechanical dewatering of the biomass. Densification of the upgraded biomass into standardized pellets (Ø 6 mm) enables an application in existing small-scale boilers.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{both the}} {{quantity}} and quality of food ingested are potent regulators of whole body protein metabolism in ruminants, little data are available on responses across a wide range of intakes. The current study examined the responses in whole body protein flux (PrF) to such intake changes and compared these with the responses across the hind-quarters (in a companion study). Six growing sheep (6 - 8 months, 30 - 35 kg) received each of four intakes of dried <b>grass</b> <b>pellets</b> (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 5 times maintenance energy; M) for a minimum of 7 days. At each intake, a mixture of U-^ 13 C amino-acids (AA) was infused intravenously for 10 h. Arterial plasma and blood were obtained over the last 4 h of infusion and the concentrations and the enrichments of thirteen ^ 13 C labelled AA were determined. The absolute values for plasma Irreversible Loss Rate (ILR) but also converted PrF varied between the AA. PrF values were lower for histidine, methionine, aspartate, glycine and proline (range 68 to 174 g·d^- 1 at 1. 5 M) than for isoleucine, leucine, valine and glutamate (range 275 to 400 g·d^- 1 at 1. 5 M). These discrepancies may be explained by (1) the differential AA removal by the splanchnic tissues, (2) the de novo synthesis of the non-essential AA, (3) the transfer of AA from the erythrocytes or plasma to the tissues. The first two assumptions require further investigation whereas recent work has shown a minor role for AA transfers between erythrocytes and tissues.

The detected levels of PFOS in the liver samples were very low (up to 4. 5 ng g - 1 ww).

Marandu) foram colhidos aos 64 e 49 dias de rebrota, respectivamente, e ensilados com 0, 5 ou 10 % de polpa cítrica peletizada (PCP), em relação à matéria verde, durante 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 e 56 dias. Foram utilizados silos experimentais de PVC adaptados com válvula do tipo Bunsen para eliminação dos gases. A forragem foi compactada visando obter densidade de 550 kg/m³. O delineamento utilizado foi o inteiramente ao acaso com três repetições, em esquema de parcelas subdivididas. A inclusão de PCP aumentou os teores de MS e diminuiu o pH das silagens. A adição de PCP influenciou os teores de N-NH 3 (N total), uma vez que, nas silagens sem PCP, os teores N-NH 3 foram significativamente elevados, o que as caracteriza como de qualidade duvidosa. A adição de PCP aumentou a concentração molar dos ácidos acético e propiônico. A população de enterobactérias foi detectada somente no primeiro dia de fermentação nas silagens do capim-tanzânia e até o 18 º dia nas do capim-marandu. Nas silagens avaliadas, a população de bactérias homofermentativas foi semelhante à das bactérias heterofermentativas. The {{experiment was}} carried out to evaluate the fermentative and microbiological dynamics of the tropical <b>grass</b> silages using <b>pelleted</b> citrus pulp (PCP) as an additive. The Tanzania (Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania) and Marandu (Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex. A. RICH) Stapf cv. Marandu) grasses were harvested at 64 and 49 days of regrowth, respectively. The following treatments were evaluated: control (0 %), addition of 5 % and 10 % of pelleted citrus pulp (PCP) in a fresh matter basis, and seven fermentation periods (1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days) after the ensilage. Experimental PVC silos with Bunsen valve to eliminate gas were used. The forage was compacted to obtain 550 kg/m³ of bulk density. It was used a split-plot arrangement in a complete randomized experimental design, with three replications per treatment. The addition of PCP increased the DM concentration and reduced the pH values of the silages. The concentration of NH 3 -N (total N) was affected by the PCP addition, {{and the absence of}} PCP resulted in silages with high N-ammonia concentration, which characterizes silages with questionable quality. The addition of PCP increased the molar concentration of the acetic and propionic acids. The enterobacteria population was detected only in the first day in the tanzaniagrass silage, and until the tenth eighth day of fermentation on the marandugrass silage. The homofermentative bacteria population was similar to the heterofermentative on the evaluated silages...|$|R
40|$|Esta pesquisa foi realizada com os objetivos de caracterizar a microbiologia e avaliar a estabilidade aeróbia de silagens de capim-marandu contendo polpa cítrica peletizada (PCP). A forragem colhida foi submetida aos seguintes tratamentos: silagem de capim-marandu; silagem de capim-marandu + 5 % PCP e silagem do capim-marandu + 10 % de PCP com base na matéria natural. As alterações químicas e microbiológicas foram feitas aos 0, 2, 4 e 6 dias após a abertura dos silos (tambores de metal com 80 cm de altura e 50 cm de diâmetro). Na avaliação da estabilidade aeróbia por meio da alteração da temperatura, 3 kg de silagem foram colocados em caixas de isopor, que foram armazenadas em câmara climática. Nos dois ensaios realizados, utilizou-se delineamento inteiramente ao acaso com cinco repetições, em esquema de parcelas subdivididas, de modo que os níveis de PCP na silagem corresponderam às parcelas e o tempo, às subparcelas. As silagens sem polpa apresentaram desenvolvimento de bacilos e enterobactérias e aumento do pH no decorrer do desabastecimento dos silos. A presença de leveduras foi detectada nas silagens contendo o aditivo e aumentou do primeiro ao sexto dia de aeração. A digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da matéria seca (DIVMS) reduziu com o aumento dos tempos de aeração. A temperatura nas silagens com 10 % de PCP aumentou durante a aerobiose. Com a abertura dos silos, as silagens apresentaram-se instáveis, seja pelo desenvolvimento de bactérias seja pelo desenvolvimento de leveduras, o que reduziu seu valor nutritivo. This trial had the {{objective}} of characterizing the microbial population and evaluating the aerobic stability of Marandu <b>grass</b> silages with <b>pelleted</b> citrus pulp (PCP). The collected forage was submitted to the following treatments: Silage of Marandu grass; silage of Marandu grass + 50 g/kg PCP and silage of Marandu grass + 100 g/kg PCP on natural matter basis. Metal cylindrical containers with 80 cm of height and 50 cm of diameter were used as silos during assays of microbiological dynamics and chemical changes of silages in anaerobiosis. Evaluations were performed on days 0, 2, 4 and 6 after silos were opened. The aerobic stability was evaluated by change in temperature, using approximately three kilograms of silage inside styrofoam boxes that were placed inside a climatic chamber. A completely randomized experimental design and split plot arrangement {{were used in the}} two assays, with five replications. Treatments were the plots and time was the subplots. Bacillus and enterobacteria were present on the Marandu grass silages with 0 g/kg PCP, which also showed pH increase throughout the feedout phase. Yeast was detected on the silages that were added with PCP. A trend of increasing temperature with extension of the aeration time was observed mainly in the silages containing 100 g/kg PCP. Isolated yeast strains showed lactate assimilation. Silages were found to be unstable due to the silo opening, both by bacterial or yeast development, which reduced the nutritional value...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiment}}s, experiment 1 {{with six}} steers in a 3 × 3 Latin-square design and experiment 2 with four wether sheep in a cross-over design, {{were conducted to}} study the effect of species and ammonia treatment on intake and utilization of the energy of untreated wheat straw. Treatments were: (1) untreated wheat straw offered ad libitum {{on top of a}} basal diet (B) consisting of hay (0 · 25) and <b>grass</b> <b>pellets</b> (0 · 75) (UWS), (2) ammoniated wheat straw offered ad libitum plus B (AWS) and (3) ammoniated wheat straw offered at a restricted level plus B (AWS-). B was offered as a maintenance diet for both species and AWS- was only studied in steers. Voluntary intake of AWS zvas higher than that of UWS. No significant differences emerged between whole rations UWS and AWS with regard to energy digestion (ED), energy metabolizability (ρ = metabolizable energy (ME) I gross energy (GE)) and losses of digestible energy (DE) in urine and methane (average 187 J/KJ DE), but the efficiency of utilization of ME for growth (kg) was significantly higher for AWS than for UWS. ED and ρ of the straw part of the ration was significantly higher for AWS than for UWS. AWS- and AWS did not differ significantly with regard to ED, ρ and DE losses in methane and urine. Steers had a higher intake per kg 0 · 75 per day than wether sheep. Across species, digestible energy intake (DEI) of the whole ad libitum fed diets was related to live weight (M) 0 · 946 (s. e. of exponent 0 · 0152). ED and ρ of the straw part of the rations did not differ significantly between species, but steers had a significantly higher ED and ρ of β than wether sheep. Steers excreted a significantly lower proportion of DE in urine and a significantly higher proportion of DE in methane than did wethers. Total energy losses in urine and methane, however, did not differ between species...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that absolute CH 4 emissions and CH 4 yield might increase and that milk production efficiency might decrease with age in cattle. Both would make strategies to increase longevity in dairy cattle less attractive. These aspects were experimentally determined in Brown Swiss cattle distributed continuously across a large age range. Thirty lactating dairy cows (876 – 3, 648 d of age) received diets consisting of hay, corn silage, and <b>grass</b> <b>pellets</b> supplemented with 0 or 5 kg of concentrate per day. Twelve heifers (199 – 778 d of age) received hay only. Cows and heifers {{were members of}} herds subjected to the 2 different feeding regimens (with or without concentrate) for the past 10 yr. Methane emissions were measured individually for 2 d in open-circuit respiration chambers, followed by quantifying individual feed intake and milk yield over 8 d. Additional data on digestibility, rumination time, and passage time of feed of all experimental animals were available. Regression analyses were applied to evaluate effects of age and feeding regimen. Body weight, milk yield, and the hay proportion of forage dry matter intake were considered as covariates. Methane emissions per unit of intake, body weight, and milk yield {{were significantly related to}} age. Their development in the cows with age was characterized by an increase to maximum at around 2, 000 d of age, followed by a decline. This response was not accompanied by corresponding age-related changes in intake, chewing activity, digesta passage time, and digestibility of organic matter, which would have explained shifts in CH 4. However, fiber digestibility showed a similar change with age as methane emissions, resulting in quite stable methane emissions per unit of digestible fiber. As expected, methane emissions intensity per unit of milk produced was greater by 8 % without concentrate than with concentrate, but no difference was noted in the response to age when the animals were subjected to different feeding regimens. The efficiency of milk production was only marginally influenced by age and diet, and no different response was observed for age in the 2 dietary regimens. In conclusion, life cycle analyses of milk production systems focusing on longevity should consider changing methane yields with age in addition to the variation in environmental costs for replacements of culled cows...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{production}} strategies {{focusing on}} longevity and limited use of concentrate are receiving increasing attention. To evaluate such strategies, {{knowledge of the}} development with age of animal characteristics, particularly digestion, is indispensable. We therefore investigated the development of feed intake, chewing activity, and digestion in 30 lactating Brown Swiss cows (876 – 3, 648 d old) and 12 heifers (199 – 778 d old). We also studied whether age effects were exhibited differently in animals selected from herds subjected for 11 yr either to a forage-only or to a forage-concentrate feeding regimen. Forages consisted of grass hay (the only feed for heifers), corn silage, and <b>grass</b> <b>pellets.</b> Measurements lasted for 8 d, where amounts and composition of feeds, feces, and milk were recorded and analyzed. Ruminal pH data and eating and rumination activity were assessed by pH sensors put into the rumen and halter-mounted noseband sensors. The mean retention time of feed particles was assessed using Cr-mordanted fiber and data were used to calculate dry matter gut fill. Data were subjected to regression analyses with age and feeding regimen as explanatory variables, and body weight, milk yield, and proportion of hay in forage as covariates. This allowed separating age-related changes of body weight and milk yield from independent age effects and correcting for differences in preference for individual forages. In cows, organic matter intake increased with age (from slightly below to above 20 kg/d), as did mean retention time and gut fill. Digestibility of organic matter did not show a clear age dependency, but fiber digestibility had a maximum in cows of around 4 to 6 yr of age. Ruminal pH and absolute eating and rumination times did not vary with cow age. Young and old cows chewed regurgitated boluses more intensively (60 – 70 times) than middle-aged cows (about 50 times). Effects of feeding regimen were small, except for fiber intake and rumination time per unit of intake, owing to the different fiber content of the diets. No significant interactions between age and feeding regimen were found. Heifers spent more time eating and ruminating per unit of feed than cows, {{which resulted in a}} high fiber digestibility. Irrespective of the feeding regimen tested, older cows maintained intake and digestion efficiency with longer retention times and chewing rumination boluses more intensively. The results support efforts to extend the length of productive life in dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|Searching for {{livestock}} production systems {{with a high}} energy utilization is of interest because of resource use and pollution aspects and because energy use is {{an indicator of the}} intensification of production processes. Due to interactions between crop and livestock enterprises and between levels of different input factors and their effects on yields, it is proposed to analyze agricultural energy utilization through system modelling of data from farm studies. Energy use in small grains, grass-clover and fodder beets registered in organic and conventional mixed dairy farms was analyzed and used together with crop yields in order to model energy prices on three Danish soil types. Conventional crop yields were higher but they also used more indirect energy with input factors, especially fertilizers. The conventional yields were not sufficiently higher to compensate for the extra use of energy compared with the organic crops. The organic crops had lower energy prices on all soil types, with the smallest difference on irrigated sandy soils. Sensitivity analyses were made for the effects of changes in irrigation and fertilizer levels. One conclusion was that better energy utilization in grain crops might be found at intermediate levels of fertilizer use, especially on irrigated soils. Actual farm diesel use was on average 47 % higher than expected from standard values, suggesting that care should be taken when basing energetic analysis of farming methods on experimental data alone. On the same farms, the energy use in dairy production registered in organic and conventional mixed dairy farms was analyzed and used together with milk and meat yields in order to model energy prices for three different feeding strategies and two soil types. Conventional dairy production is more intensive with a greater feeding ration and a higher proportion of high-protein Seed, but has also higher yields. The conventional yields were not sufficiently higher to compensate for rite extra use of energy compared with the organic feeding ration. However, the loll er energy price in organic dairy production is dependent on the composition of the feeding strategy. Substitution of 500 SFU of grain with <b>grass</b> <b>pellets</b> makes an ordinary organic feeding ration based on conventional crop production competable. In general, the crop energy price models car? be used together with the dairy production to model the effects of different feeding and crop rotation strategies on the overall energy utilization in mixed dairy production systems...|$|E
