50|$|The highest {{concentrations}} of plicatic acid {{can be found}} in Thuja plicata (Western Red cedar), but Thuja occidentalis (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Arborvitae)</b> and Cryptomeria japonica (Sugi) contain it in significant proportions as well.|$|E
50|$|Thuja occidentalis, {{also known}} as {{northern}} white-cedar or <b>eastern</b> <b>arborvitae,</b> is an evergreen coniferous tree, in the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to eastern Canada {{and much of the}} north, central and upper Northeastern United States, but widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.

50|$|The flora {{found at}} Enzo Creek {{have yet to}} be {{comprehensively}} inventoried, as the project would be a colossal undertaking. Tree types include deciduous species such as pin oak, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, aspen, ash, birch, cherry, apple, sassafras, American hornbeam, ironwood, and walnut trees. Coniferous species include jack pine, red pine, eastern white pine, <b>eastern</b> hemlock, <b>arborvitae,</b> Scots pine, and blue spruce.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a pioneer}} that invades the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs, though often preceded {{slightly}} by Larix laricina (tamarack), {{with which it}} may in time form a stable forest cover in swamps. However, as the peat soil is gradually elevated by the accumulation of organic matter, and the fertility of the site improves, Balsam Fir and Thuja occidentalis (<b>eastern</b> <b>arborvitae)</b> will eventually replace black spruce and tamarack.|$|E
50|$|The H. H. Hunnewell {{estate in}} Wellesley, Massachusetts was the country home of H. H. Hunnewell (1810-1902), {{containing}} over 500 species of woody plants in 53 families.

50|$|Much of {{the land}} in Arvon Township is forest with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous trees. There are also jack pine barrens and <b>eastern</b> <b>arborvitae</b> swamps. In settled areas, there are many wild apple trees which now form a significant food source for deer. Arvon Township has a number of rivers, including the Huron River, which flow into Lake Superior. Because of these factors, the primary economic activities in Arvon Township are related to logging or tourism, particularly hunting and fishing.|$|E
