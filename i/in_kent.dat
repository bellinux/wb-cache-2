5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{questioned}} the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the Historia's account of {{the arrival of the}} Germanic invaders <b>in</b> <b>Kent</b> should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current <b>in</b> <b>Kent</b> during Bede's time.|$|E
5|$|Bede relates {{that after}} the mission's arrival <b>in</b> <b>Kent</b> and {{conversion}} of the king, {{they were allowed to}} restore and rebuild old Roman churches for their use. One such was Christ Church, Canterbury, which became Augustine's cathedral church. Archaeological evidence for other Roman churches having been rebuilt is slight, but the church of St Pancras in Canterbury has a Roman building at its core, although it is unclear whether that older building was a church during the Roman era. Another possible site is Lullingstone, <b>in</b> <b>Kent,</b> where a religious site dating to 300 was found underneath an abandoned church.|$|E

5|$|Cædwalla's {{departure}} in 688 {{appears to}} have led to instability {{in the south of}} England. Ine, Cædwalla's successor, abdicated in 726, and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List says that he reigned for thirty-seven years, implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688. This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. The kingship also changed <b>in</b> <b>Kent</b> in 688, with Oswine, who was apparently a Mercian client, taking the throne; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence <b>in</b> <b>Kent</b> in the years immediately following Cædwalla's abdication.|$|E

5|$|In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was {{the prior}} of the Abbey of St Andrew's in Rome, to head the mission to Kent. The pope {{selected}} monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy {{in a series of}} letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their grandmother Brunhild, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine <b>in</b> <b>Kent,</b> as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people. Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence <b>in</b> <b>Kent.</b> Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.|$|E
5|$|In 597 {{the mission}} landed <b>in</b> <b>Kent,</b> and it quickly {{achieved}} some initial success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where {{they used the}} church of St. Martin's for services, and this church became {{the seat of the}} bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597.|$|E
