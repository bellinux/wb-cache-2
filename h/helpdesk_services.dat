40|$|Background. To contain severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority set {{a policy}} that stipulated {{there should be no}} visitors to hospital wards. A <b>helpdesk</b> <b>service</b> was established with the goal of providing immediate emotional and communication support to relatives while severe acute respiratory syndrome patients were isolated during the acute phase of the illness. Aim. This study describes the results of a rapid assessment of the effectiveness of a <b>helpdesk</b> <b>service</b> designed to meet the immediate needs of relatives of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients in Hong Kong. Design. Survey. Method. Eighty-three respondents, representing about 46. 3 % of relatives (179), attending the helpdesk {{on the day of the}} study were recruited. Service evaluation data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire completed by respondents. Results. Nearly 100 % of respondents who used the service found the delivery service with on-site counselling useful for alleviating their anxiety. However, about half of these relatives complained of insufficient information regarding the patient's condition and progress. The majority of respondents were satisfied with the service. In describing the most important traits of the service providers, caring and enthusiasm were mentioned most frequently by respondents who stated that they were very satisfied with the service. Conclusion. The results support the value of the service, and demonstrate that the service is effective in meeting relatives' immediate needs. These needs include information, aid in fulfilling their role as caretaker for the patient (delivering prepared soup) and psychological support. The results suggest that facilitation of visitation of patients by relatives via video conferencing and education of the public on the nature and course of severe acute respiratory syndrome to reduce the social stigma of having a potentially life-threatening disease should be introduced in Hong Kong. Relevance to clinical practice. The results highlight important attributes that helpers (nurses) should have in order to alleviate the suffering of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients and their relatives. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

There is very little impact evaluation evidence of the developmental outcomes of interventions to support regular migration. The review identified only one migration intervention (the New Zealand Recognised Seasonal Employment Programme) which had had rigorous impact evaluations conducted: the scheme was found to have positive impacts on employers, migrants and origin countries (Gibson & McKenzie, 2013; Winters, 2016). Otherwise the evidence base in relation to migration interventions was found to be consistently weak. The literature highlights the lack of ‘an evaluation culture’ in relation to migration policies and programmes, despite growing numbers of interventions; it stresses the need for strengthened impact evaluation and makes recommendations to promote this. Research on migration and development as a whole,however, is growing, with a number of research organisations working on these issues...|$|R

40|$|Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is {{the process}} of solving a given problem based on the {{knowledge}} gained from solving precedents. It is an effective technique in the area of customer <b>services</b> or <b>helpdesks.</b> That is, a CBR system is used to solve most of the commonly occurring customer problems. While the implementation techniques may vary, most CBR systems include the following five steps: case representation and storage, precedent matching and retrieval, adaptation of the retrieved solution, validation of the solution, and finally, casebase update to include the information gained from the new problem. This paper details the various implementation techniques for these five steps, while focusing on a particular helpdesk system, namely SmartUSA, developed for the Union Camp Corporation. This system solves a customer’s problem by filtering the problem description through an alias table to generate a brief description and then matching the brief description with the cases in the database. It has proved to be an effective and user-friendly system that has successfully handled different descriptions of the same problem and allowed for the casebase to be built in free-format (plain) text. This system has significantly reduced the workload and the response time in the customer services department of the Union Camp Corporation.

Over the past six years the civil war in Syria has evolved into a multifaceted conflict with numerous actors both internally and externally. As a result a complicated framework of governance has emerged with fragmented arrangements operating across the country. Therefore, although there are policies that can be implemented across the board and centralised institutions can be developed, an understanding of local needs also has to be formed in order to better enhance local governance capacity. There are a number of elements – such as security, aid, reconstruction, return dynamics, reconciliation and external actors – that also impact on governance and thus have {{to be taken into account}} when addressing issues of governance. This review highlights what analysts see as the key areas that need to be addressed or supported in relation to governance in Syria both now and once the conflict has ended...|$|R

The Syrian conflict is now in its seventh year and involves a wide range of both national and international parties. Crucially, no party {{is in a position to}} establish control over the entire country. This has implications for efforts at stabilisation. There is increasing recognition that the Assad regime cannot be displaced and hence must factor in efforts to find a political solution. The recent focus has been on ways to reduce the fighting, paving the way for transition talks. Two major processes have been underway to find a solution to the Syrian conflict: the ‘Geneva process’ under the auspices of the UN, and the ‘Astana process’ led by Russia, Iran and Turkey. The latter differs from the former in that it involves armed groups and seeks to find a way to end the fighting before then working on a political settlement. Progress was made at the latest round of Astana talks in May, with endorsement of four ceasefire zones in the country which would allow the return of displaced civilians and provision of humanitarian aid to those areas...|$|R

Economic sanctions have become a popular tool in international politics, with the US being the largest actor in imposing sanctions. The aim of sanctions is to ensure government compliance with the imposer’s interests and are often viewed as more humane than military intervention. However, economic sanctions are also criticised for not achieving their objective and for having a negative impact on areas such as human rights, democracy, poverty, healthcare, and basic living conditions. This rapid review synthesises findings from rigorous academic, practitioner, and policy references, focusing on recent and seminal works with the aim of highlighting the impact of sanctions on poverty and economic development. This review examines the wider impact of sanctions globally {{in order to create a}} better understanding of the role that sanctions play in Sudan and to counteract the fact that there are minimal studies focused on the impact of sanctions in Sudan itself. It is important to note that the majority of studies on sanctions are quantitative and thus involve many case studies to prove an overriding theory and do not cover much specific detail. For this reason there are not many studies of the impact of sanctions on Sudan specifically, however there is data to be extracted on poverty and the economic growth, which can be contextualised using the quantitative studies...|$|R
40|$|Managing virtualized {{services}} efficiently {{over the}} cloud {{is an open}} challenge. Traditional models of software development are very time consuming and labor intensive for the cloud computing domain, where software (and other) services are acquired on demand. Virtualized services are often composed of pre-existing components that are assembled on an as-needed basis. We have developed a new framework to automate the acquisition, composition and consumption/monitoring of virtualized services delivered on the cloud. We have divided the service lifecycle into five phases of requirements, discovery, negotiation, composition, and consumption and have developed ontologies to represent the concepts and relationships for each phase. These are represented in Semantic Web languages. We have developed a protocol to automate the negotiation process when acquiring virtualized services. This protocol allows complex relaxation of constraints being negotiated based on user defined policies. We have also developed detailed ontologies to define service level agreements for cloud services. To illustrate and validate how this framework can automate the acquisition of cloud services, we have built two applications from real world scenarios. The Smart cloud services application enables users to determine and procure the cloud storage service that matches most of their constraints and policies. We have also built a VCL broker application that allows users to automatically reserve the VCL Image that will best meet their requirements. We have developed a framework to measure and semi-automatically track quality of a virtualized service delivery system. The framework provides a mechanism to relate hard metrics typically measured at the backstage of the delivery process to quality related hard and soft metrics tracked at the front stage where the consumer interacts with the service. While this framework is general enough {{to be applied to}} any type of IT service, in this dissertation we have primarily concentrated on the <b>Helpdesk</b> <b>service</b> and include the performance rules we have created by mining Helpdesk data...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Virtual Health Sciences Library of the Balearic Islands (Bibliosalut) {{serves the}} public health system {{professionals}} by providing relevant scientific information through new information and communication technologies. The Bibliosalut's platform is the primary way of communication with its users, and works as a platform for access to various resources and services. This raises {{the need for a}} Bibliosalut’s platform reconceptualization. It involves new look, new content, new structure and services, responding to new trends on the web. Materials and methods We conducted a reassessment of the platform's structure, trying to combine the different sections in a logical manner and provide quick access to frequently used tools for library users. Static HTML changed into dynamic web and Joomla! became the new tool for managing the contents of the Virtual Library, allowing the application of the portal's new design and structure. The reasons that led to the choice of this open source content management system were its simple installation process, its simple configuration and content organization in the management console, its clear separation between public area and the area of administration and its wide range of templates, components and modules for the development of new applications. Results The project's result is a platform structured in seven main sections which give access to the main resources of the Virtual Library: databases, electronic journals, books and other electronic resources, library services and information about the Virtual Library. In addition to the new structure, we create a <b>helpdesk</b> <b>service,</b> we integrate the regional union catalogue of health science libraries made with PMB, and we connect to the Athens validation system to facilitate remote access to subscription resources. Conclusions The new Bibliosalut’s platform allows faster access to resources, a broader range of information and the creation of personalized services. In addition, this new tool is a starting point for creating new content, new products and communication flows. Likewise, this change in philosophy is accompanied by a greater online presence through the participation of Virtual Library in 2. 0 tools...|$|R
