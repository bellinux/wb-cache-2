50|$|In humans, <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> can be {{used when}} a woman cannot, for any {{of a number of}} reasons, {{conceive}} by natural means. The sperm may be provided by either by a sexual partner of her choice or by a sperm donor. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> techniques available include intracervical insemination and intrauterine <b>insemination.</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> using donor sperm is most commonly employed by lesbian couples, single women. and heterosexual couples when the male partner is suffering from male infertility. Compared with natural <b>insemination,</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> may be more invasive, and it may require professional assistance and medical expertise, which will have a higher cost.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reproductive performance in swine using two <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> techniques. Were used 60 animals overall, the breed was DB 90 (DanBred) the average of the age was 22 months than weight 210 kg. The experimental delimitation was divided into two groups, which one containing 30 animals, randomly. The first group the animal were inseminated with post-cervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> technique, with 1. 5 billons of spermatozoa in 50 ml, and in the second group was executed the intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> technique, with 3 billons of spermatozoa in 80 ml. The statistic was not parametric analyze (Kruskal-Wallis) and test of de averages by Student-Newman-Keuls (p< 0. 05). The number of return to estrus was 2 in both groups (postcervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> vs intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination),</b> the number of abortions (0 vs 2), the number of farrow (28 vs 26), the farrowing rate (93. 33 % vs 86. 68 %), and the litter size (14. 07 vs 14. 10), respectively. The post-cervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> showed similar results comparing with the intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> We conclude that the postcervical technique has several possible advantages for the producer, being possible the reduction of 40 % to 45 % of reproducers on the squad...|$|R
50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> may employ {{assisted}} reproductive technology, {{sperm donation}} and animal husbandry techniques. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> techniques available include intracervical insemination and intrauterine insemination. The beneficiaries of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> {{are women who}} desire {{to give birth to}} their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship, single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility. Intracervical insemination (ICI) is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance. Compared with natural insemination (i.e., insemination by sexual intercourse), <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.|$|R

50|$|While {{working as}} an {{obstetrician}} at the Royal Free Hospital in London during the early 1940s, Mary Barton had also had similar success and founded the first private clinic offering <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> in the United Kingdom. In 1945, Barton collaborated with Wiesner and Walker on a paper for the British Medical Journal, describing their technique of human <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> The paper precipitated highly publicized condemnation from the Pope who called it a sin, and the Archbishop of Canterbury who called for the British parliament to make human <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> illegal. Although it was not criminalized it was not legalized either and therefore the status of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> was ambiguous. Consequently, the activities of Barton and Wiesner at the fertility clinic were conducted in secrecy and all inseminated women were instructed to tell nobody about it.|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{blastocyst}} {{production and}} collection using superovulation and intrauterine insemination {{was established in}} albino Syrian hamsters. Twenty female albino hamsters were injected pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, 25 IU) in non-breeding season and 48 h or 56 h later, 25 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were injected. Both groups {{were divided into two}} subgroups of natural mating and <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> The former group was mated with a fertile male (1 male for 2 fe-males) after hCG injection and in the next morning, the hamsters with vaginal plug were regarded as pregnant. In the <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> group, intrauterine <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> of 1 × 108 sperms was done 12 h after hCG injection.
