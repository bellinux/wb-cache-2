40|$|Upon {{stimulation}} by odorants, Ca 2 + and Na+ {{enter the}} cilia of olfactory sensory neurons through channels directly gated by cAMP. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels {{have been found}} in a variety of cells and extensively investigated in the past few years. Glutamate residues at position 363 of the alpha subunit of the bovine retinal rod channel have previously been shown to constitute a cation-binding site important for blockage by external divalent cations and to control single-channel properties. It has therefore been assumed, but not proven, that glutamate residues at the corresponding position of the other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels play a similar role. We studied the corresponding glutamate (<b>E</b> <b>340)</b> of the alpha subunit of the bovine olfactory channel to determine its role in channel gating and in permeation and blockage by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. <b>E</b> <b>340</b> was mutated into either an aspartate, glycine, glutamine, or asparagine residue and properties of mutant channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were measured in excised patches. By single-channel recordings, we demonstrated that the open probabilities in the presence of cGMP or cAMP were decreased by the mutations, with a larger decrease observed on gating by cAMP. Moreover, we observed that the mutant <b>E</b> <b>340</b> N presented two conductance levels. We found that both external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + powerfully blocked the current in wild-type and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> D mutants, whereas their blockage efficacy was drastically reduced when the glutamate charge was neutralized. The inward current carried by external Ca 2 + relative to Na+ was larger in the <b>E</b> <b>340</b> G mutant compared with wild-type channels. In conclusion, we have confirmed that the residue at position <b>E</b> <b>340</b> of the bovine olfactory CNG channel is in the pore region, controls permeation and blockage by external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and affects channel gating by cAMP more than by cGMP...|$|R

Nine stream samples were collected at different discharges during 2003 - 2006, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid {{was used as a}} quality control standard in the assays. Dissolved organic matter in high-discharge samples was more light-absorbing at 280 and 340 nm and adsorbed more strongly to alumina, than DOM characteristic of low streamflow, but was less fluorescent and hydrophilic, and poorer in proton-dissociating groups. No significant differences were found in light absorption at 254 nm, copper- or benzo(a) pyrene binding, or photochemical fading. Combination of the Rough Sike data with previously-published results for other streams and a lake yields totals of 20 - 23 values per assay, for a range of DOM types. Analysis of these data shows that DOM hydrophilicity and adsorption are well-predicted by linear relationships with the extinction coefficient at <b>340</b> nm (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> while good quadratic relationships exist between <b>E</b> <b>340</b> and both buffering capacity and fluorescence.

40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial {{adhesion}} is {{an important}} determinant of colonization and infection, including dental caries. The salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein gp- 340, which mediates adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (implicated in caries), harbours three major size variants, designated gp- <b>340</b> I to <b>III,</b> each specific to an individual saliva. Here we have examined the association of the gp- <b>340</b> I to <b>III</b> polymorphisms with caries experience and adhesion of S. mutans. Methods A case-referent study was performed in 12 -year-old Swedish children with high (n = 19) or low (n = 19) caries experiences. We measured the gp- <b>340</b> I to <b>III</b> saliva phenotypes and correlated those with multiple outcome measures for caries experience and saliva adhesion of S. mutans using the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate projection technique. In addition, we used traditional statistics and 2 -year caries increment to verify the established PLS associations, and bacterial adhesion to purified gp- <b>340</b> I to <b>III</b> proteins to support possible mechanisms. Results All except one subject were typed as gp- <b>340</b> I to <b>III</b> (10, 23 and 4, respectively). The gp- 340 I phenotype correlated positively with caries experience (VIP = 1. 37) and saliva adhesion of S. mutans Ingbritt (VIP = 1. 47). The gp- <b>340</b> II and <b>III</b> phenotypes tended to behave in the opposite way. Moreover, the gp- 340 I phenotype tended to show an increased 2 -year caries increment compared to phenotypes II/III. Purified gp- 340 I protein mediated markedly higher adhesion of S. mutans strains Ingbritt and NG 8 and Lactococcus lactis expressing AgI/II adhesins (SpaP or PAc) compared to gp- <b>340</b> II and <b>III</b> proteins. In addition, the gp- 340 I protein appeared over represented in subjects positive for Db, an allelic acidic PRP variant associated with caries, and subjects positive for both gp- 340 I and Db tended to experience more caries than those negative for both proteins. Conclusion Gp- 340 I behaves as a caries susceptibility protein. </p...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor in its empty {{as well as}} agonist(i. e. active) and antagonist-bound (i. e. nonactive) forms have been carried out. The agonists 5 -HT and (R) - 8 -OH-DPAT {{as well as the}} antagonist WAY 100635 have been employed. The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the receptor portions close to the E/DRY/W motif, with prominence to the cytosolic extensions of helices 3 and 6, are particularly susceptible to undergo structural modification in response to agonist binding. Despite the differences in the structural/dynamics behavior of the two agonists when docked into the 5 -HT 1 A receptor, they both exert a destabilization of the intrahelical and interhelical interactions found in the empty and antagonist-bound receptor forms between the arginine of the E/DRY sequence and both D 133 (3. 49) and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30). For both agonists, the chemical information transfer from the extracellular to the cytosolic domains is mediated by a cluster of aromatic amino acids in helix 61 following the ligand interaction with selected amino acids in the extracellular half of the receptor, such as D 116 (3. 32), S 199 (5. 42), Y 195 (5. 38), and F 361 (6. 51). A significant reduction in the bend at P 360 (6. 50), as compared to the empty and the antagonist-bound receptor forms, is one of the features of the agonist-bound forms that is related to the breakage of the interhelical salt bridge between the E/DRY arginine and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30).

Firstly, it potentiates initiation of transcription from the capsite of the heterologous Ad 2 MLP and from "cryptic" sites often preceded by TATA box-like sequences. Secondly, although there is no critical distance requirement between the enhancer element and the Ad 2 MLP, the extent of stimulation decreases as the distance between the two element increases. However, in contrast to the other known viral or cellular enhancers which are bidirectional, the Ad 2 enhancer is unidirectional, i. e. it potentiates the Ad 2 MLP element only when it is inserted in its "natural" orientation with respect to the direction of transcription.

In this study, live and frozen/thawed A. simplex larvae were subjected to conventional or microwave heating during time-temperature suffi{dotless}cient to kill live larvae, and digested with pepsin in the strong conditions used in fi{dotless}sh inspection. The antigenicity of A. simplex in the larvae extracts and in the incubation media fi{dotless}ltrates after all treatmentswas studied. RESULTS: The immunoblotting assay showed the presence of Ani s 4 in all the larvae extracts and all the incubation media filtrates. A. simplex crude antigenswere detected in all conditions; nevertheless, differenceswere observed among treatments, with lower values detected in the filtrates obtained after the strong acidic pepsin treatment. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that ingestion of A. simplex larvae can cause allergy in consumers already sensitised to this allergen, even if the parasitised fish is consumed well-cooked and after freezing in the recommended conditions selected for killing the larvae to avoid human anisakiasis. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) is a lysosomal) beta-glucosidase that degrades glucosylceramide. Its {{deficiency}} {{results in}} Gaucher disease (GD). We {{examined the effects}} of active site occupancy of GBA on its structural stability. For this, we made use of cyclophellitol-derived activity-based probes (ABPs) that bind irreversibly to the catalytic nucleophile (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> and for comparison, we used the potent reversible inhibitor isofagomine. We demonstrate that cyclophellitol ABPs improve the stability of GBA in vitro, as revealed by thermodynamic measurements (T-m increase by 21 degrees C), and introduce resistance to tryptic digestion. The stabilizing effect of cell-permeable cyclophellitol ABPs is also observed in intact cultured cells containing wild-type GBA, N 370 S GBA (labile in lysosomes), and L 444 P GBA (exhibits impaired ER folding) all show marked increases in lysosomal forms of GBA molecules upon exposure to ABPs. The same stabilization effect is observed for endogenous GBA in the liver of wild-type mice injected with cyclophellitol ABPs. Stabilization effects similar to those observed with ABPs were also noted at high concentrations of the reversible inhibitor isofagomine. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the increase in cellular levels of GBA by ABPs and by the reversible inhibitor is in part caused by their ability to stabilize GBA folding, which increases the resistance of GBA against breakdown by lysosomal proteases. These effects are more pronounced {{in the case of the}} amphiphilic ABPs, presumably due to their high lipophilic potential, which may promote further structural compactness of GBA through hydrophobic interactions. Our study provides further rationale for the design of chaperones for GBA to ameliorate Gaucher diseas...|$|R
40|$|Background: High {{pressure}} (HP) {{ranging from}} 100 to 350 MPa (1 - 15 min) {{was applied to}} Anisakis simplex larvae and parasitised hake (Merluccius merluccius) muscle. The aim {{of the study was}} to kill the larvae to prevent human anisakidosis, to evaluate the effect on A. simplex allergens and to minimally alter fish muscle quality. Results: The larvae were killed at pressures ≥ 200 MPa and times ≥ 1 min, producing alterations in the larva body and ruptures in the cuticle when observed by scanning electron microscopy. Nevertheless, Ani s 4 and A. simplex crude antigens were recognised by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry at all HPs assayed. Small changes in colour and texture were observed in fish muscle under all pressure/time conditions. Major changes were observed visually at 300 MPa, where the muscle appeared as slightly cooked. Apparent viscosity of muscle homogenates decreased significantly at longer times or higher applied pressure. No changes were detected at 200 MPa in the electrophoretic pattern of proteins treated with or without β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that disulfide bonds were not formed. Conclusion: Application of HP at 200 MPa for up to 5 min would kill A. simplex larvae, avoiding infestation of the consumer and causing small changes in the hake muscle perceived sensorially. However, HP-treated A. simplex-parasitised fish would still be a potential hazard for consumers allergic to the larvae. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Deficiency of {{glucocerebrosidase}} (GBA) causes Gaucher disease (GD). In {{the common}} non-neuronopathic GD type I variant, glucosylceramide accumulates {{primarily in the}} lysosomes of visceral macrophages. Supplementing storage cells with lacking enzyme is accomplished via chronic intravenous administration of recombinant GBA containing mannose-terminated N-linked glycans, mediating the selective uptake by macrophages expressing mannose-binding lectin(s). Two recombinant GBA preparations with distinct N-linked glycans are registered in Europe for treatment of type I GD: imiglucerase (Genzyme), contains predominantly Man(3) glycans, and velaglucerase (Shire PLC) Man(9) glycans. Activity-based probes (ABPs) enable fluorescent labeling of recombinant GBA preparations through their covalent attachment to the catalytic nucleophile <b>E</b> <b>340</b> of GBA. We comparatively studied binding and uptake of ABP-labeled imiglucerase and velaglucerase in isolated dendritic cells, cultured human macrophages and living mice, through simultaneous detection of different GBAs by paired measurements. Uptake of ABP-labeled rGBAs by dendritic cells was comparable, {{as well as the}} bio-distribution following equimolar intravenous administration to mice. ABP-labeled rGBAs were recovered largely in liver, white-blood cells, bone marrow and spleen. Lungs, brain and skin, affected tissues in severe GD types II and III, were only poorly supplemented. Small, but significant differences were noted in binding and uptake of rGBAs in cultured human macrophages, in the absence and presence of mannan. Mannan-competed binding and uptake were largest for velaglucerase, when determined with single enzymes or as equimolar mixtures of both enzymes. Vice versa, imiglucerase showed more prominent binding and uptake not competed by mannan. Uptake of recombinant GBAs by cultured macrophages seems to involve multiple receptors, including several mannose-binding lectins. Differences among cells from different donors (n = 12) were noted, but the same trends were always observed. Our study suggests that further insight in targeting and efficacy of enzyme therapy of individual Gaucher patients could be obtained by the use of recombinant GBA, trace-labeled with an ABP, preferably equipped with an infrared fluorophore or other reporter tag suitable for in vivo imagin...|$|R

The samples were evaluated in a commercial crop at: 0, 20, 40, 70, 130, 180, 230, 260, 280, 310 and 340 days after the planting (DAP) and the first fruits were harvested at 230 DAP. The results showed the low height (199 cm in 340 DAP) and low first flowering’s heigth (71 cm), which is important to facilitate the harvest process. The plants presented good yield with high number of leafs (allowing a great area of fruit cover) and about 60 fruits per plant. The fruits kept similar features to cv. Golden. The fruit’s fresh weight ranged from 302. 4 to 467. 5 g, which is in the range of the Brazilian market. The pulp thickness was 2. 35 cm, which is a feature of great economic interest. The pulp thickness showed close relation with climatic factors, and great variations of temperature and precipitation accelerated the pulp loss of thickness.

40|$|Gaucher {{disease is}} caused by {{mutations}} in the gene encoding acid beta-glucosidase (GlcCerase), resulting in glucosylceramide (GlcCer) accumulation. The only currently available orally administered treatment for Gaucher disease is N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (Zavesca, NB-DNJ), which partially inhibits GlcCer synthesis, thus reducing levels of GlcCer accumulation. NB-DNJ also acts as a chemical chaperone for GlcCerase, although at a different concentration than that required to completely inhibit GlcCer synthesis. We now report the crystal structures, at 2 A resolution, of complexes of NB-DNJ and N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) with recombinant human GlcCerase, expressed in cultured plant cells. Both inhibitors bind at the active site of GlcCerase, with the imino sugar moiety making hydrogen bonds to side chains of active site residues. The alkyl chains of NB-DNJ and NN-DNJ are oriented toward {{the entrance of the}} active site where they undergo hydrophobic interactions. Based on these structures, we make a number of predictions concerning (i) involvement of loops adjacent to the active site in the catalytic process, (ii) the nature of nucleophilic attack by Glu- <b>340,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> the role of a conserved water molecule located in a solvent cavity adjacent to the active site. Together, these results have significance for understanding the mechanism of action of GlcCerase and the mode of GlcCerase chaperoning by imino sugars...|$|R
40|$|Proteins are {{commonly}} fused to Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) {{to enhance their}} yield and facilitate their purification. In addition, the stability and solubility of a passenger protein can often be improved by fusing it to MBP. In a previous comparison with two other highly soluble fusion partners, MBP was decidedly superior at promoting the solubility {{of a range of}} aggregation-prone proteins. To explain this observation, we proposed that MBP could function as a general molecular chaperone {{in the context of a}} fusion protein by binding to aggregation-prone folding intermediates of passenger proteins and preventing their self-association. The ligand-binding cleft in MBP was considered a likely site for peptide binding because of its hydrophobic nature. We tested this hypothesis by systematically replacing hydrophobic amino acid side chains in and around the cleft with glutamic acid. None of these mutations affected the yield or solubility of MBP in its unfused state. Each MBP was then tested for its ability to promote solubility when fused to three passenger proteins: green fluorescent protein, p 16, and E 6. Mutations within the maltose-binding cleft (W 62 E, A 63 E, Y 155 E, W 230 <b>E,</b> and W <b>340</b> <b>E)</b> had little or no effect on the solubility of the fusion proteins. In contrast, three mutations near one end of the cleft (W 232 E, Y 242 E, and I 317 E) dramatically reduced the solubility of the same fusion proteins. The mutations with the most profound effect on solubility were shown to reduce the global stability of MBP...|$|R
