5|$|In recent years, Gyeongju <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> {{the same}} trends that have {{affected}} the rest of South Korea. Like {{the country as a}} whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultivated}} plant taxonomy {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> its own path.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> a pro-Western {{foreign policy}} and {{maintained}} close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Oram Davidson (born December 31, 1949, in Rome, New York) is an American equestrian who competes in {{the sport}} of eventing.

He began college at Iowa State University, but left in his third year to train full-time with the United States Equestrian Team. In 1974 he married, and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977.

5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E

Drafted as a forward and playing the majority of his career in the forward line, he has kicked over one hundred goals, including a career-high season in 2016, in which he kicked thirty-eight goals. Although he has played a majority of his career in the forward line, he has been praised for his versatility which allows him to play in multiple positions on the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E

5|$|In a later arc, Hitsugaya leads a {{group of}} Soul Reapers {{assigned}} to defend Karakura Town against the Arrancar that Aizen has enlisted to his cause. He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> the Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society {{to help in the}} preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen. From there, Hitsugaya engages Aizen, and is tricked into stabs Momo in the chest with Aizen taking advantage of the youth's rage of being tricked to cut his left limbs off. After Aizen's defeat and healed, Hitsugaya resolves to train so that he can more freely use his strongest move as a Soul Reaper, bankai, to protect Hinamori.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regular}} season finale of 2001, Favre {{was the target of}} minor {{controversy}} when, in a game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, he was sacked by the Giants defensive end Michael Strahan. It was Strahan's lone sack of the game and gave him the NFL's single–season sack record of 22.5, which topped Mark Gastineau's record of 22 set in 1984. The controversy (Favre fell over unusually easily) <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> Strahan continuously since he set the record. Jim Fassel, Strahan's coach in 2001, said that when a respected athlete like Strahan gets close to an all-time record, sometimes opponents want him to break it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} act, Hyde fears {{that he will}} be arrested for the murder. He gives his landlady, Rebecca, money to tell {{visitors}} that he is not home. Inspector Newcome from Scotland Yard offers Rebecca more money to turn Hyde in, which she promises to do. Hyde flees to Jekyll's laboratory, where Utterson is waiting to confront the doctor about his will; he insults Utterson and leaves. Rebecca, who <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> Hyde, arrives and tells Utterson that Hyde murdered Sir Danvers. In the play's original version, the act ends with Jekyll returning to his laboratory. In later versions (revised after its premiere), the second act contains an additional scene in which Jekyll returns home; his friends think he is protecting Hyde. Agnes, who saw Hyde before her father was murdered, wants Jekyll to accompany her to provide the police with a description, and is distraught when he refuses.|$|E
