5000|$|The Winter Nelis pear is a {{deciduous}} {{pear tree}} growing to 8 m depending on rootstock, and is sparse and spreading in form. It is not frost tender. Its flowers are self-sterile and a pollinator tree is required that flowers {{at a similar}} time (its flowering group is D or 4). It is a late-season <b>dessert</b> <b>pear.</b> The fruit are medium in size and have outstanding storage properties for a pear, easily keeping {{for a couple of}} months. Hoggs Fruit Manual (1880s) describes it as one of the richest flavoured pears, flesh being yellowish, fine-grained, buttery and melting, with a rich, sugary and vinous flavour and a fine aroma.The pear is named after Jean Charles Nelis, who raised it from seed in the early 1800s. It was introduced to England in 1818 and to the USA in 1823 ...|$|E

40|$|The {{flesh and}} peel of 19 pear cultivars (8 Tunisian dessert cultivars, 8 European dessert cultivars and 3 French perry pear cultivars) were studied for their {{phenolic}} composition. Phenolic compounds {{were identified by}} HPLC/ESI-MS 2 and individually quantified by HPLC-DAD. Five classes of polyphenols were present: flavan- 3 -ols, phenolic acids, flavonols, anthocyanins and simple phenolics (hydroquinones). The total phenolic content ranged between 0. 1 g/kg Fresh Weight (FW) ('Conference' cultivar) and 8. 6 g/kg FW ('Plant De Blanc' cultivar) in the flesh and between 1. 6 g/kg FW ('William vert' cultivar) and 40. 4 g/kg FW ('Arbi Chiheb' cultivar) in the peel. Procyanidins, analyzed after thioacidolysis, were the main phenolic compounds in all pear cultivars either in the pulp or the peel, their constitutive units being essentially (-) -epicatechin. Tunisian <b>dessert</b> <b>pears</b> and French perry pears are richer in procyanidins with very high degree of polymerization (> 100) for Tunisian pears. Peel procyanidins were less polymerized (from 4 to 20). Pear peel phenolic profile was more complex especially for Tunisian cultivars, with flavonols and in some cultivars anthocyanins...|$|R

5000|$|MacGibbon & Ross {{record that}} flower gardens stood {{to the side}} of the {{property}} within a walled garden. In 1875 this garden was still under cultivation and in the orchard had stood the parent tree of the famous Auchans pear, the first of its kind in the county, brought in from France (or Norway) at an early date, said to be during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. This tree had grown to a great height and was blown down in 1793. In 2003 a sample of pears from Pluscarden Abbey near Elgin were sent for identification and were found to be the Black Aachen or Auchans pear. Hogg's Fruit Manual also records them as growing in Cheshire.The Auchans pear may have taken its name from the castle as the proper name, 'The Toadback Pear', had dropped out of usage. It is a lumpy russet, showing great health and vigour and the fruit is described as being as [...] "ugly as a toad". Other varieties are Red Auchan and Winter Achan. The flesh is described as tender, buttery, juicy, sugary, with a rich and aromatic flavour. Auchans are Scotch <b>dessert</b> <b>pears</b> of first-rate quality; ripe in November and December. As stated, the tree is a very abundant and regular bearer, particularly when it has acquired age. The Auchans pear spread all over Scotland as shown by the Pluscarden Abbey survival.|$|R
5000|$|Poire belle Hélène ( [...] ; Birne Helene) is a <b>dessert</b> {{made from}} <b>pears</b> poached in sugar syrup {{and served with}} vanilla ice cream and {{chocolate}} syrup. It was created around 1864 by Auguste Escoffier and named after the operetta La belle Hélène by Jacques Offenbach. Simpler versions replace poached pears with canned pears and sliced almonds.|$|R
40|$|Of all {{the organic}} food sectors in the UK, top fruit {{is one of}} the least developed. Despite strong {{consumer}} demand and high prices for organic fruit there are, at present, only a handful of commercial organic <b>dessert</b> apple and <b>pear</b> growers. One of the barriers to conventional growers converting to organic production has been the lack of robust data on the economics of organic fruit growing. Therefore the overall aim of this study and benefit to the sector was the collection and assessment of economic data from commercial organic top fruit (<b>dessert</b> apples and <b>pears)</b> farms for three seasons (2001 - 2003) in order to determine its economic feasibility. Data was collected from fruit growers and processed according to Farm Business Survey techniques and was also analysed on a pence per kg basis, a full cost accounting technique developed for analysing top fruit crops. Over the past few years there has been a rapid growth of both the market for organic top fruit, and an increase in the area of land converted to organic top fruit production, although much of the latter has been of older cider orchards. The market for organic top fruit, with a retail value of £ 67 million and 7...|$|R
6000|$|A great loud bell: midday and {{the crew}} going to eat, rushing to eat. After some time we are summoned. [...] "The Signora isn't eating?" [...] asks the waiter eagerly: hoping she is not. [...] "Yes, she is eating," [...] say I. I fetch the q-b from her berth. Rather wanly she comes and gets into her spin chair. Bash comes a huge plate of thick, oily cabbage soup, very full, swilkering over the sides. We {{do what we can}} with it. So does the third passenger: a young woman who never wears a hat, thereby admitting herself simply as one of [...] "the people," [...] but who has an {{expensive}} complicated dress, nigger-coloured thin silk stockings, and suede high-heeled shoes. She is handsome, sturdy, with large dark eyes and a robust, frank manner: far too robustly downright for Italy. She is from Cagliari--and can't do much with the cabbage soup: and tells the waiter so, in her deep, hail-fellow-well-met voice. In the doorway hovers a little cloud of alpaca jackets grinning faintly with malignant anticipation of food, hoping, like blow-flies, we shall be too ill to eat. Away goes the soup and appears a massive yellow omelette, like some log of bilious wood. It is hard, and heavy, and cooked in the usual rank-tasting olive oil. The young woman doesn't have much truck with it: neither do we. To the triumph of the blow-flies, who see the yellow monster borne to their altar. After which a long long slab of the inevitable meat cut into innumerable slices, tasting of dead nothingness and having a thick sauce of brown neutrality: sufficient for twelve people at least. This, with masses of strong-tasting greenish cauliflower liberally weighted with oil, on a ship that was already heaving its heart out, made up the dinner. Accumulating malevolent triumph among the blow-flies in the passage. So on to a <b>dessert</b> of oranges, <b>pears</b> with wooden hearts and thick yellowish wash-leather flesh, and apples. Then coffee.|$|R
