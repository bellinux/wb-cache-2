40|$|As {{research}} in the area of <b>excess</b> power <b>production</b> moves forward, issues associated with thermal to electric conversion become increasinglyimportant. This paper provides a brief tutorial on basic issues, including the Carnot limit, entropy, and thermoelectric conversion. Practical thermal to electric conversion is possible well below the Carnot limit, and this leads to a high threshold for self-sustaining operation in Pons-Fleischmann type experiments. <b>Excess</b> power <b>production</b> at elevated temperatures will become increasingly important as we move toward self-sustaining devices and energy <b>production</b> for applications. <b>Excess</b> power <b>production</b> in heatproducing systems that do not require electrical input have an enormous advantage over electrochemical systems.

25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is a risk}} factor for neurological disorders. Metabolomic studies suggest an excess of organic acids, impaired lipid oxidation byproducts, essential fatty acids and essential amino acids in the blood serum of affected patients.

25|$|The {{occurrence}} of gout {{is connected with}} an <b>excess</b> <b>production</b> of uric acid. A diet rich in sucrose may lead to gout as it raises the level of insulin, which prevents excretion of uric acid from the body. As the concentration of uric acid in the body increases, so does the concentration of uric acid in the joint liquid and beyond a critical concentration, the uric acid begins to precipitate into crystals. Researchers have implicated sugary drinks high in fructose in a surge in cases of gout.|$|E

25|$|With European {{countries}} such as Germany and Denmark moving to very high levels (80% and 100% respectively by 2050) of renewable energy for all energy uses there will be increasing periods of <b>excess</b> <b>production</b> of renewable electrical energy. Storage of this energy as potential electrical energy (e.g. pumped hydro) is very costly and reduces total round-trip efficiency. However, storing it as heat in district heating systems, for use in buildings where there is demand, is significantly less costly. Whilst {{the quality of the}} electrical energy is degraded, high voltage grid MW sized heat pumps would maximise efficiency whilst not wasting excess renewable electricity. Stockholm at present has about 660 MW of heat pumps connected to its district heating system.|$|E

40|$|For open systems {{described}} by the quantum master equation (QME), we investigate the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production</b> under quasistatic operations between nonequilibrium steady states. The average entropy production is composed of the time integral of the instantaneous steady entropy production rate and the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production.</b> We propose to define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle currents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME. The <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production</b> is given by a line integral in the control parameter space and its integrand is called the Berry–Sinitsyn–Nemenman (BSN) vector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is {{described by}} lnρ˘ 0 and ρ 0 where ρ 0 is the instantaneous steady state of the QME and ρ˘ 0 {{is that of the}} QME which is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term.

2500|$|The Brazilian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century. Coffee was the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 63% of the country's exports in 1891, and 51% between 1901 and 1910. [...] However, sugar, cotton, tobacco, cocoa, and, during the turn-of-the-century rubber boom, rubber were also important. During the first three decades of the 20th century, the Brazilian economy went through periods of growth but also difficulties caused in part by World War I, the Great Depression, and an increasing trend toward coffee overproduction. The four-year gap between the time a coffee tree is planted and the time of the first harvest magnified cyclical fluctuations in coffee prices, which in turn led to the increasing use of government price supports during periods of <b>excess</b> <b>production.</b> The price supports induced an exaggerated expansion of coffee cultivation in São Paulo, culminating in the huge overproduction of the early 1930s.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the total entropy {{production}} in stochastic processes with odd-parity variables (under time reversal) is separated into three parts, only two of which satisfy the integral fluctuation theorems in general. One is the usual <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production,</b> which can appear only transiently and is called nonadiabatic. Another one is attributed solely to the breakage of detailed balance. The last part not satisfying the fluctuation theorem comes from the steady-state distribution asymmetry for odd-parity variables, which is activated in a non-transient manner. The latter two contributions combine together as the house-keeping (adiabatic) entropy production, whose positivity is not guaranteed except when the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production</b> completely vanishes...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{considered}} quantum systems coupled to several baths. We supposed {{that the system}} state is governed by the quantum master equation (QME). We investigated the quantum pump and the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production.</b> In {{the first half of}} the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full counting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the latter part of the thesis, we investigated the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production.</b> The average entropy production is composed of the time integral of the instantaneous steady entropy production rate and the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production.</b> We define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle currents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME. The <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production</b> is given by a line integral in the control parameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN) vector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is described by ρ_ 0 ^(- 1) and ρ_ 0 where ρ_ 0 is the instantaneous steady state of the QME and ρ_ 0 ^(- 1) is that of the QME which is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term. In general, the potential dose not exist. The origins of the non-existence of the potential are a quantum effect (the Lamb shift) and the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry. The non-existence of the potential means that the excess entropy essentially depends on the path of the modulation. If the system Hamiltonian is non-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the <b>excess</b> entropy <b>production</b> approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann entropies of the system. We pointed out that the expression of the entropy production obtained in the classical Markov jump process is different from our result and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in the weakly nonequilibrium regime.
