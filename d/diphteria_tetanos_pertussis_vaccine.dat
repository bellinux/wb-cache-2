The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) was analyzed for Emergency Department (ED) visits, life-threatening reactions, hospitalizations, disabilities, deaths, seizures, infantile spasms, encephalitis/encephalopathy, autism, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and speech disorders reported with an initial onset of symptoms within 3 days following whole-cell pertussis and acellular <b>pertussis</b> <b>vaccines</b> among those residing in the US from 1997 to 1999. Controls were employed to evaluate potential biases in VAERS. Evaluations as to whether whole-cell and acellular vaccines were administered to populations of similar age and sex were undertaken because these factors might influence the study’s results. Statistical increases were observed for all events examined following whole-cell pertussis vaccination in comparison to acellular pertussis vaccination, excepting cerebellar ataxia. Reporting biases were minimal in VAERS, and whole-cell and acellular <b>pertussis</b> <b>vaccines</b> were administered to populations of similar age and sex. Biologic mechanisms for the increased reactogenicity of whole-cell <b>pertussis</b> <b>vaccines</b> may stem {{from the fact that}} whole-cell <b>pertussis</b> <b>vaccines</b> contain 3000 different proteins, whereas DTaP contains two to five proteins.

RESULTS: Twelve children with extensive limb swelling were enrolled in the study. Ultrasound examinations demonstrated swelling of both the subcutaneous and muscle layers of the vaccinated arm. Ultrasound assessment showed that the swelling exceeded the clinical measurements of skin redness and swelling.
