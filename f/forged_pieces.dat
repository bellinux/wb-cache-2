40|$|Heavy {{machinery}} {{industry is}} characterized by a number of specifi c features that cause signifi cant variations in the processing time of products in the individual workplaces and frequent occurrence of fl oating bottlenecks, which change their positions. Depending on the product range being processed, a given workplace is the bottleneck only for some period of time. When the bottleneck moves to another workplace, it leads to unnecessary loss of capacity of the fl oating bottleneck. To maximize the utilization, it is necessary to protect those bottlenecks by creating special buff ers. The objective {{of this article is to}} design a methodology used for the determination and control of buff ers that are going to protect the fl oating bottlenecks from operating capacity losses caused by transfer of the constrain to another workplace.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} for planning and control of complicated heavy machinery production {{which is based on}} the principle of „production paths “ – production paths planning and control concept. The concept refl ects the limited applicability of traditional concepts and systems for production planning and control in conditions of heavy machinery industry that is specifi c by the limited repeatability of product structures and volumes, by compli-cated and variant material fl ows and unbalanced capacity utilisation. The production path represents a production capacity reserved by time or a space and is determined for the realisation of products with the same level of produc-tion repeatability. The given principle enables categorisation of the complicated production to „fast “ and „slow“ production paths. The fast production path is designed for processing of products specifi c either by a mass or series production type. The slow path, on the other hand, is designed for the resources reserved for a production of few series or single-pieces. The proposed concept signifi cantly reduces diffi culties of heavy machinery production plan-ning and control. It cuts work in process inventory and improves the material fl ow continuousness, the balance and utilisation of production resources as well as the whole production process.

40|$|Samples of Haynes 230 nickel-based {{superalloy}} {{were taken from}} forgings at Carlton Forge Works. These samples represented components that passed and failed ductility specification. Metallographic measurements of particle size and intergranular particle count were taken from 25 locations across the sample. Carbide particles at the grain boundaries were equal size, averaging 13. 0 μm in diameter. The low ductility samples contained an average of twelve particles per 250 μm of grain boundary, high ductility samples contained an average of only four particles along the same grain boundary length. To {{determine the effects of}} forging temperature on carbide distribution in the microstructure, three 4 -in-diameter, 4 -in-height Haynes 230 billets were upset forged to 7 -in-diameter, 1 -in-height at 2050 °F, 2150 °F, and 2250 °F. For each forging, samples were removed and solutionized at 2150 °F, 2200 °F, and 2250 °F for 45 minutes. Each combination of forging temperature and solutionizing temperature was tensile tested to determine yield strength and ductility. Results showed the alloy increased ductility with forging temperature, which corresponded to decreased particle count. Mechanical properties were altered less prominently with solutionizing temperature, but a small increase in tensile strength and decrease in ductility was associated with higher temperature solutionizing, accompanied by a decreased particle size. Particle count and distribution were found to the key factor in determining ductility of the material. Forging at low temperatures causes plastic deformation at the grain boundaries, providing a low energy nucleation site for migrating carbon in solution, thereby increasing the number of particles in the <b>forged</b> <b>pieces.</b> The optimal combination of ductility and yield strength occurred at 2150 °F forging temperature and 2200 °F solutionizing temperature...|$|E
40|$|Metallographic {{examinations}} of twenty two objects connected to agricultural {{life at the}} stronghold in Semonice (13 th to 14 th century) are evaluated in a {{first part of the}} paper. Tools like axes, knives and the timber shave were carefully fitted with welded-on steel edges; only one knife blade is completely made of steel. One sickle has a welded-on steel blade, the others are iron. Moreover, one of the two borers was provided with steel welded-on cutting edges, the second one has a spiral-shaped serrated part which is practically completely of steel. It was nonetheless welded from several rods. Steel was surprisingly lavishly used in the manufacture of the horse-shoes; two out of three of them were improved. In the case of the shears the construction is not sufficiently clear. An evaluation of the heat treatment of the Semonice objects is not possible (fire at the site), but originally they must have been quenched, and if not all of them, then at least most of them. The construction of the tools and implements was good, even if the steel of the edges was not of very good quality.

The invention «The diagnostics method for defects on the metal surfaces (RU 2581441) » refers to the methods used to detect defects and cracks on the surface of metal equipment and pipe lines. The suspension of metal nanoparticles is consistently applied on the surface of controlled object following direction from the bigger diameter to the smaller one. The nanoparticles possess the photoluminescence property and their shape is spheric with different diameters. After each application the surface is dried and excessive particles are removed. Then rowwise scanning of object surface is executed with the ray of femtosecond laser {{and at the same time}} the intensity of the two-photon luminescence signal is registered in every studied area fixing the location of this area and obtaining the map of glow intensity distribution of nanoparticles exited by the laser radiation. The maps shows the zones with the maximal glow intensity, the coor dinates and shape of the determined glow zone make it possible to determine the coordinates and shape of the defect and the size of its intersection is considered to be equal to relative diameter of the applied nanoparticles at this application stage.
