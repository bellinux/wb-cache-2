50|$|Nakajima Utako {{was born}} in 1844 (or 1841), the second {{daughter}} of Nakajima Matazaemon (中島又左衛門). Her childhood name was Tose (とせ). As descendants of the statesman, Ōta Dōkan, the builder of Edo Castle, the Nakajimas were known for generations as village leaders. The house of Fukushima (福島), the mother's family, was also a powerful trading house and court supplier of the shogun. The mother {{was active in the}} inner service of Kawagoe Castle and was able to establish close relations with the house of Nabeshima. When Nakajima was 10 years old, she became a maid of honor in the estate of the <b>highest</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>officer</b> of Matsudaira (松平) in Harima Province (in today's Hyōgo Prefecture). At the age of 18, she married a vassal of Mito-han, Hayashi Chūzaemon (林忠左衛門), and moved with him to Mito. But he was seriously injured in 1864, just before the Meiji restoration, and committed suicide. After the Meiji restoration, Nakajima returned to Edo (now Tokyo), where she received an education in waka and calligraphy under Katō Chinami (加藤千浪). As a poet of the old school, she gained prominence. Around the year 1877, she founded the school of Haginoya, where she mainly trained women of the upper and middle class. In total, more than 1,000 graduates attended the school. Among them were Higuchi Ichiyō and Miyake Kaho (三宅花圃). Her works include 近代の女性文学者たち (鎬を削る自己実現の苦闘; Kindai no josei bungakushatachi: shinogi o kezuru jiko jitsugen no kutō), 萩のしつく (中嶋歌子先生遺稿; Hagi no shizuku: Nakajima Utako Sensei ikō), 文学者の手紙. 5 (Bungakusha no tegami. 005), and 早稲穂のかつら (Wasaho no katsura).|$|R

40|$|Après le rattachement de la Franche-Comté à la France par le traité de Nimègue en 1678, et le choix de Besançon comme capitale de la {{province}} en 1681, le destin de la ville changea radicalement. De nombreux Comtois vinrent occuper les rangs du parlement déplacé de Dole, l’ancienne capitale, à Besançon ; et de hauts fonctionnaires, souvent parisiens, s’y installèrent aussi, soit à demeure, soit temporairement. La juxtaposition de ces deux sphères sans unité de goût se lit encore dans les pierres de la ville. A partir d’un corpus d’une trentaine d’hôtels bâtis entre 1730 et 1750, moment où l’élite eut enfin envie de se fixer à Besançon, on observe la diffusion de deux modèles : l’un ancré dans la tradition locale, l’hôtel sur rue, bâti pour une clientèle de parlementaires comtois et par des architectes bisontins ; l’autre solution, l’hôtel entre cour et jardin dit aussi « hôtel à la parisienne » étant le fruit d’une importation due à de grands personnages étrangers à la province, lesquels firent aussi appel à des architectes hors de la sphère locale. Durant vingt ans, nous assistons ainsi à l’acculturation des modes parisiennes dans un milieu où les derniers raffinements de l’art de vivre à la française avaient encore très peu pénétré, qu’il s’agisse d’architecture, de décor ou de confort. After {{the province}} of Franche-Comté was joined to France by the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678 and Besançon chosen as the province’s capital in 1681, the destiny of the town was radically altered. Many Comtois came {{to sit in the}} Parlement, which was transferred to Besançon from Dole, the former capital. Various <b>high</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>officers,</b> often of Parisian origin, also settled in the town, either permanently or on a temporary basis. The juxtaposition of these two spheres of influence can still be read in the city’s buildings. A corpus of some thirty town houses built between 1730 and 1750 was studied, covering this crucial period when new elites came to settle in Besançon. This corpus allows us to identify the development of two distinct models. One, rooted in local tradition, was the town house fronting the street, designed for a clientele of Parlementaires and built by local architects. The second solution, with the house placed between a front courtyard and a garden behind, also known as a “Hôtel à la parisienne”, was an imported model introduced by important figures from outside the province, who also commissioned architects from outside the province. During this period of twenty years, we can thus witness the acculturation of Parisian fashions in a milieu where the latest refinements of the French way of life were still something of a novelty, whether in architecture, in interior design or in standards of comfort...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 12th century the Papal chamberlain (...) was a regular member of the Curia, {{entrusted}} with the financial management of the papal court. At that early period the income of the papal treasury came chiefly from many kinds of census, dues, and tributes paid in from the territory subject to the Pope, and from churches and monasteries immediately dependent on him. Cencius Camerarius (later Pope Honorius III, 1216-27) made in 1192 a new inventory of all these sources of papal revenue, known as the Liber Censuum. The previous list dated back to Gelasius I (492-496) and Gregory I (590-604), and was based on lists of the incomes accruing from the patrimonies, or landed property of the Roman Church. In the 13th century the Apostolic Camera entered on a new phase of development. The collection of the crusade taxes, regularly assessed after the time of Innocent III (1198-1216), imposed new duties on the papal treasury, to which were committed both the collection and distribution of these assessments. Moreover, {{during the course of this}} century the system of payment in kind was transformed into the monetary system, a process considerably influenced by the administration of the papal finances. The servitia communia of bishops and abbots (see Annates) were regulated at fixed sums. The income regularly yielded by them to the Curia is by no means small. To these were to be added the annates, taken in the narrower sense, especially the great universal reservations made since the time of Clement V and John XXII, the extraordinary subsidies, moreover, levied since the end of the thirteenth century, the census, and other assessments. The duties of the Apostolic Camera were thus constantly enlarged. For the collection of all these moneys it employed henceforth a great number of agents known as collectores. With time the importance of this central department of finance became more marked. The <b>highest</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>officers</b> were always the chamberlain (camerarius) and the treasurer (thesaurarius) — the former regularly a bishop, the latter often of the same rank. Next in order came the clerics of the Camera (clerici camerœ), originally three or four, afterwards as many as ten. Next to these was the judge (auditor) of the Camera. The two first-named formed with the clerics of the Camera its <b>highest</b> <b>administrative</b> council; they controlled and looked closely to both revenues and expenses. In their service were a number of inferior officials, notaries, scribes, and messengers. The more absolute system of ruling the Church which developed after the beginning of the 16th century, as well as the gradual transformation in the financial administration, modified in many ways the duties of the Apostolic Camera. The Camerarius (camerlengo, chamberlain) became one of the highest officers in the government of the Papal States, until the beginning of the 19th century, when new methods of administration called for other officials. In 1870 what remained of the Papal States was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy and ceased to exist, replaced by the diminutive Vatican City: the Apostolic Camera ceased almost entirely to exercise any practical influence on the papal administration, and the income of the papal treasury since chiefly derived from Peter's-pence and other donations contributed by the faithful, the Camera lost its practical importance as a board of finance, for the revenue known as Peter's-pence is managed by a special commission. The officials who since constituted the camera — the cardinal-camerlengo, the vice-camerlengo, the auditor, the general treasurer (an office unoccupied since 1870) and seven cameral clerics — hold in reality quasi-honorary offices.|$|R
