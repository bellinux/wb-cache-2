2500|$|In 2008, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the 8.4 L (512.5 cu in) V10, the Viper produced [...] at 6000 rpm and [...] at 4600 rpm, and also received better flowing heads with larger valves, Mechadyne cam-in-cam variable valve timing on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> lobes, and dual electronic throttle bodies. The rev limit could be increased by 300rpm due to the improved valve-train stability from both the new camshaft profiles and valve-springs. The engine was [...] developed with some external assistance from McLaren Automotive and Ricardo Consulting Engineers. Electronic engine control is developed by Continental AG; the controller can monitor the crankshaft and cylinder position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{again at}} Geneva Motor Show, an all-new turbocharged petrol engine badged as 1750 TBi (Turbo Benzina iniezione) {{was added to}} the lineup. This 1742 cc unit featured direct injection and variable valve timing on both inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams,</b> and developed [...] and [...] of torque.|$|R
5000|$|The B5244T3 is a 2.4 L (2,435 cc) straight-five. It is {{turbocharged}} and intercooled with a {{power output}} of [...] with 285 Nm of torque at 1800 rpm. It features <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> VVT.|$|E
5000|$|The B5244T4 is a 2.4 L (2,435 cc) straight-five. It is {{turbocharged}} and intercooled with a {{power output}} of [...] at 5000 rpm with 285 Nm of torque at 1500 rpm. It features VVT for both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 4B1 {{engine family}} {{is the first to}} have the {{continuously}} variable valve timing MIVEC system applied not only to its intake valves but also to its exhaust valves. The intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> timing is continuously independently controlled and provide four optimized engine operating modes.|$|E
50|$|Variable cam timing: Allows {{for control}} {{variable}} intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> (V.V..T), mapping the exact advance/retard curve positioning the camshafts for maximum benefit at all load/rpm {{positions in the}} map. This functionality {{is often used to}} optimize power output at high load/R.P.M.s, and to maximize fuel efficiency and emissions as lower loads/R.P.M.s.|$|R
50|$|Subaru's 2003-2009 EZ series EZ30 engine {{featured}} a Porsche designed and German manufactured Variable Valve Lift (VVL) system, that further enhances high range power and smoothness at idle. It was discontinued on the successor of the EZ30 engine, the EZ36 engine. Instead, it has dual AVCS, VVT on both inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{difference}} from Hondas VTEC {{system is that}} NEO VVL engages the change of intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> independently for a flatter, more consistent power band. On the SR20VE, the intake camshaft is switched at 5000 rpm, and the exhaust at 6500 rpm. However this trait was not included on the newer 20V version, as both camshafts engage at the same RPM.|$|R
5000|$|The B5244T5 is a 2.4 L (2,401 cc) straight-five. Bore is 81 mm {{and stroke}} is 93.2 mm. It is {{turbocharged}} and intercooled {{with a power}} output of [...] at 5500 rpm with 350 Nm of torque at 2100 rpm. It features VVT for both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 2.0 L Zetec shared its 84.8 mm bore and 88.0 mm stroke {{with its}} predecessor, the 2.0 L 2-valve CVH. On {{top of the}} 16 Valve DOHC head, the Zetec for the US Market Escort ZX2, Contour, and Cougar gained Variable Valve Timing on the <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Cam,</b> {{removing}} its requirement of EGR for US Emissions.|$|E
5000|$|The B5244T7 2.4 L (2,401 cc) straight-five. Bore is 83 mm {{and stroke}} is 90 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 9.0:1. It is turbocharged and intercooled {{with a power}} output of [...] at 5700 rpm with 285 Nm of torque between 1800-5000 rpm. It features VVT for both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam.</b> It is equipped with Bosch ME7 engine management.|$|E
5000|$|The 4GR-FSE is a 2.5 L (2499 cc) version. Bore is 83.0 [...] mm while stroke {{is reduced}} to 77.0 [...] mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 12.0:1. Output is [...] at 6,400 RPM and [...] at 3,800 RPM. This version also features Dual VVT-i, variable valve timing on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> and an improved D4 direct injection system.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the model}} year 2009, Alfa Romeo {{introduced}} a new turbocharged Gasoline (Petrol) engine badged as [...] "TBi", this 1742 cc unit has direct injection and variable valve timing in both inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams.</b> This new engine has [...] and 320 Nm of torque. Eventually this unit will replace GM derived 2.2 and 1.9 JTS units. Also a new [...] JTDm diesel became available.|$|R
50|$|The K24A2 engine {{used in the}} TSX {{was related}} to the engine in the Honda Accord (7th generation), the Honda CR-V, and the Honda Element. The K24A2 {{featured}} intelligent variable valve timing (i-VTEC) and produced 200 horsepower (150 kW) in this iteration. Another feature of the i-VTEC system on the TSX and RSX-s was that, unlike other Honda K-series motors, variable timing was used on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> in its three rocker design.|$|R
50|$|The Coyote is Ford's first {{implementation}} of its cam-torque-actuated (CTA) Twin Independent Variable Cam Timing (Ti-VCT) in a V8 engine, {{which allows the}} power-train control module (PCM) to advance and retard intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> timing independently of each other, providing improved power, fuel economy and reduced emissions. The engine is assembled in Ford's Essex Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario, using existing Modular tooling.|$|E
5000|$|The F8-DOHC is a DOHC F8 and {{basically}} a de-stroked {{version of the}} FE-DOHC displacing 1789 cc - 1.8L. It uses the same <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam,</b> but a different intake cam with less lift and a long, single-runner intake manifold. The F8 is usually identified by its unpainted cam cover. Output was 113 hp (84 kW) at 6000 rpm and [...] at 5000 rpm. It is usually found in wagon variants.|$|E
5000|$|The economy i-VTEC K20A3/K24A4 engines is {{more like}} the SOHC VTEC-E in that the intake cam has only two lobes, one very small and one larger, as well as no VTEC on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam.</b> The two types of(K20A2)engine are easily {{distinguishable}} by the factory rated power output: the performance engines make around [...] or more in stock form and the economy(K20A3)engines do not make much more than [...] from the factory.|$|E
5000|$|The 2GR-FE is a 3.5 L (3456 cc) {{version for}} {{transverse}} FWD, 4WD, or AWD mounting. Bore remains at 94 mm but stroke {{is reduced to}} 83 mm. Reported output varies depending on the vehicle application, but is approximately [...] to [...] at 6200 rpm with 248 lbft Nm to 260 lbft Nm of torque at 4700 rpm on 87 octane (R+M/2). This version features Toyota's Dual VVT-i, variable valve timing on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams.</b> The cams are driven using a timing chain.|$|R
5000|$|Maximum {{power was}} {{increased}} to [...] The maximum engine speed was increased to 7,200 rpm {{in the first}} generation, and 7,900 for the second generation. It used the Harmonic damper from the 4E-FTE, more aggressive intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams,</b> some versions (not the Sera) had the ACIS intake, high compression pistons, 4-2-1 exhaust headers, and had stronger internals (i.e. the [...] "fat" [...] connecting rods found in the first generation 5E-FE). Basically, it included all of the best parts from the 4/5E series engines.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota UR {{engine family}} is a 32-valve quad-camshaft V8 piston engine series which was first {{introduced}} in 2006 as the UZ series it replaced began phasing out. Production started with the 1UR-FSE engine with D4-S direct injection for the 2007 Lexus LS. The series launched with a die-cast aluminum block, aluminum heads, and magnesium cylinder head covers. All UR engines feature variable valve timing for both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> or Dual VVT-i. Timing chains are used to drive the camshafts. The UR engine has been produced in 4.6, 5.0, and 5.7 liter displacement versions.|$|R
50|$|Early large {{displacement}} motorcycles provided riders with {{a manual}} control for this when kick starters were used while later models linked {{them to the}} kick lever through a cable for automatic operation. Though it only uses electric start, not kick start, the 2012 Ducati 1199 uses a compression release, which is automatically activated at low engine speed by a centrifugal flyweight on each <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam.</b> This reduces the work of cranking the high 12.5:1 compression ratio engine, allowing a smaller battery and smaller starter motor, for a total weight savings of 3.3 kg.|$|E
50|$|For twin cam or DOHC engines, VCT {{was used}} {{on either the}} intake or exhaust camshaft. (Engines that have VCT on both {{camshafts}} are now designated as Ti-VCT.) The use of variable camshaft timing on the exhaust camshaft is for improved emissions, and vehicles with VCT on the exhaust camshaft do not require exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as retarding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> timing achieves the same result. VCT on the intake camshaft is used primarily for increasing engine power and torque as the PCM is able to optimize {{the opening of the}} intake valves to match the engine conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The Cortina Crossflow {{block was}} also {{the basis for the}} FVA, an F2 engine {{introduced}} in 1966, and developed under the same contract as the DFV, for the new 1.6-litre engine rules. This engine featured 16 valves operated by twin overhead camshafts driven by a train of 9 gears. The metering unit for the Lucas mechanical fuel injection was rotated by a toothed belt from the gear-driven inlet cam, while the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> directly drove an alternator on the rear of the head. It produced [...] at 9000 rpm. This engine dominated the category until 1971, and was also used in sports car racing in 1.8 Litre form as the FVC.|$|E
50|$|The {{intake valve}} was {{automatic}} (actuated by atmospheric pressure) and the <b>exhaust</b> valve was <b>cam</b> driven.|$|R
50|$|The V6 {{engine is}} fitted with four {{overhead}} camshafts driven by synchronous tooth belts. It has a single, long, serpentine belt {{at the front}} driving the inlet cams and also the coolant pump. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> are driven by short link belts driven from {{the ends of the}} inlet cams {{at the rear of the}} engine. The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any tensioning device. Belt tension is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting. The front belt drive is tensioned by a spring-loaded tensioner pulley incorporating a hydraulic damping element.|$|R
5000|$|The JTS direct {{injection}} system {{was first used}} in a V6 engine in 2005 {{with the introduction of}} the Alfa 159 and Brera. This is not related to the Alfa Romeo V6 engine, but is instead a derivation of the GM High Feature engine; built in Australia by GM Holden. While it retains the High Feature engine's 89 mm bore, 85.6 mm stroke and chain driven camshafts, it is modified by Alfa for their performance, fuel economy and sound characteristics. These modifications include: [...] "TwinPhaser" [...] variable valve timing (cam-phasing on both inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams,</b> thus the name), gasoline {{direct injection}} and a higher compression ratio of 11.25:1. It also operates with a lean burn system up to about 1500 rpm, as on many other engines from the company and is capable of generating , a number matching the larger LY7 3.6 L variant used by GM. Alfa Romeo stopped using the V6 JTS engine in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|... 4th Gen ZC Identified by: Internal coil. OBD1 EFi system (grey plug). No {{cam angle}} sensor on <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam,</b> now located in distributor. Rubber plug where cam angle sensor would mount. Black cam cover. No PGM-EFi {{plate on the}} inlet manifold, {{replaced}} with three ribs instead. P29 stamped on inlet manifold. MAP sensor on TB. +7cc PM7 pistons, pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC only appeared in EG5 Civic bodies, no Integra or CRX received this engine. Reasonably common produced from '92 to '94. (20th Anniversary edition & Japanese car of the year) D-series version D16A8/9 (Euro & Australia Civic Si) (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons) ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used cam is the cam plate (also known as disc cam or radial cam)which is cut out {{of a piece of}} flat metal or plate. Here, the follower moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the camshaft. Several key terms are relevant in such a construction of plate cams: base circle, prime circle (with radius equal to the sum of the follower radius and the base circle radius), pitch curve which is the radial curve traced out by applying the radial displacements away from the prime circle across all angles, and the lobe separation angle (LSA - the angle between two adjacent intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> lobes).|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the 8.4 L (512.5 cu in) V10, the Viper produced [...] at 6000 rpm and 560 lbft Nm at 4600 rpm, and also received better flowing heads with larger valves, Mechadyne cam-in-cam variable valve timing on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cam</b> lobes, and dual electronic throttle bodies. The rev limit could be increased by 300 rpm due to the improved valve-train stability from both the new camshaft profiles and valve-springs. The engine was developed with some external assistance from McLaren Automotive and Ricardo Consulting Engineers. Electronic engine control is developed by Continental AG; the controller can monitor the crankshaft and cylinder position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit.|$|E
50|$|The MGC was {{cancelled}} in 1969 after {{less than}} two years of production. Today the car is considered very collectible and the main causes of the poor reputation relating to handling have, in the main, been overcome by better tyres and subtle modification of suspension settings. Simple tuning of the under-developed straight-six is also common and simple modifications to head, <b>exhaust</b> and <b>cam</b> release approximately 30 per cent more power and torque than the original.|$|R
50|$|N-VCT varies {{valve timing}} by {{rotating}} the affected camshaft(s) {{relative to the}} sprocket; valve lift and duration are not altered. This rotation is achieved when an electric solenoid, controlled by the car's ECU, allows pressurized engine oil to flow into and through the cam and into a slave mechanism, axially advancing cam timing relative to the sprocket. Valve to crank angle timing varies depending on whether engine speed is high or low and changes at fixed intervals. NVTCS is hydraulically actuated similar to Honda’s VTEC system, but adjusts a different aspect of the valve train, so it is more like the I part of I-VTEC. NVTCS equipped Nissan engines do not have as high of engine speeds as VTEC equipped engines so NVTCS is simpler, quieter, and requires no special maintenance. Some Nissan engines only have N-VCT on the intake cam such as the GA16DE, SR20DE/DET (S14-15) or RB25DE/DET (R33-R34 GTS/GTS-T, GT/GTT) while others have it on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams.</b> NVTCS was eventually phased out and replaced by a continuously variable system called CVTCS on newer engines such as the VQ and VK series.|$|R
2500|$|The updated VQ35HR is more {{powerful}} ( [...] at 6,800 rpm and [...] at 4,800 rpm), more fuel efficient, and more responsive than the previous VQ35DE. The [...] "HR" [...] stands for [...] "High Revolution" [...] or [...] "High Response". A dual-path intake (two air cleaners, throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent freer flowing. The intake is said to benefit from a ram-air effect adding three horsepower at 60mph. Electrically actuated variable valve timing is new on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cams</b> which broadens the torque curve. The new engine block maintains the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4mm to reduce piston side-loads. 80% of the internal components have been strengthened or redesigned to handle the increased 7,500 rpm red line, along {{with the use of}} larger crank bearings with main bearing caps reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1 these changes add 26 more horsepower. Torque is down [...] from the old DE engine (268 vs. 270). The engine now sits 15mm lower in the chassis for a lower center of gravity.|$|R
