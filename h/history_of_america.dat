5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical social <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, {{the evolution of}} jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E

[...] "Some [...] scene veterans maintain that MDA", a drug related to Ecstasy, [...] "was a vital contributor to grunge", because it gave users a [...] "body high" [...] (in contrast to marijuana's [...] "head high") that made them appreciate [...] "bass-heavy grooves". Pat Long's [...] History of the NME states that scene members involved with the Sub Pop label would have multi-day MDMA parties in the woods, which shows that what Long calls Ecstasy's [...] "warm glow" [...] had an impact even in the wet, grey and isolated Pacific Northwest region.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty-eight {{witnesses}} — {{that was}} the story {{that came from the}} police. And it really is what made the story stick.

I was puzzled by that until I added up the entries themselves. Some of them were interviews with two or three people [...] lived in the same apartment. I believe that some harried civil servant gave that number to the police commissioner who gave it to Rosenthal, and it entered the modern <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> after that.|$|E
