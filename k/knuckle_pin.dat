40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a pilot study}} of end connections for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene 12 -strand braided rope (synthetic rope) for use in timber harvesting applications. Fourteen different end connections for 14 mm and 16 mm diameter synthetic rope were developed and break tested to determine suitability. Three types of end connections were evaluated: spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. End connections with adhesive had variable strength performance and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware group, the <b>pinned</b> nubbin and <b>knuckle</b> link provided the highest breaking strengths. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, <b>knuckle</b> link, <b>pinned</b> nubbin, and in limited applications, rope clamps. Further research and development is needed on these six concepts with larger sample sizes and under testing and operating varied conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The next {{match of}} the event was between Eddie Golden and K.C. Thunder. Thunder was {{accompanied}} by manager Allan Barrie who taunted the largely Southern crowd under his [...] "Duke of New York" [...] persona. Golden was able to hit Thunder with his frog splash finisher but Barrie pulled referee Ed Foster {{out of the ring}} before he could count the pinfall. While Barrie and Foster argued outside the ring, Thunder struck Golden with brass <b>knuckles</b> and <b>pinned</b> Golden when the referee turned around. Initially declared the winner, Foster found the foreign object on Thunder and awarded the match to his opponent via disqualification. Afterwards, Golden confronted Barrie over his outside interference. As Golden prepared to hit him, Barrie pleaded for mercy pointing out that he was wearing glasses. Golden seemingly relented but then took the manager's glasses off, handed them to the referee, and knocked out Barrie in one punch.|$|R
5|$|On the October 11, 2004 {{edition of}} Raw, La Résistance {{had to defend}} the World Tag Team Championship in a match with Eugene and William Regal. Regal hit Sylvain Grenier {{with a pair of}} brass <b>knuckles</b> and <b>pinned</b> him to win the World Tag Team title. Eric Bischoff, however, {{restarted}} the match. The match resulted in La Résistance retaining the title, after Robért Conway jabbed Regal in the side with a flagpole. Bischoff informed La Résistance that at Taboo Tuesday they were scheduled to defend the World Tag Team title against the two individuals who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World title. Shawn Michaels won the fans choice, which gave Edge and Chris Benoit a World Tag Team title match. Edge, however, abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle both members of La Résistance by himself. Despite this, Benoit managed to force Conway to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|R
5000|$|Rumble {{is similar}} to Puzzle Bobble; players launch multicolored balls {{in order to make}} groups of three or more. However, players may also [...] "charge" [...] balls up to make combos, adding to the {{opposing}} player's field. As they can for sword fighting, players can purchase weapons to enhance their rumbling. Players start with their only hands, but can purchase bludgeons which send different, more complex patterns of balls to their opponents. Bludgeons include gaffs, brass <b>knuckles,</b> hammers, belaying <b>pins,</b> and chains, among others. There is a variant of Rumble called Boxing that is played with only one ball instead of the usual two, but is otherwise identical.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 {{front axle}} {{was used in}} 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 front axles in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed <b>knuckle,</b> with king <b>pins</b> and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 front axle started out with 23 spline axle shafts {{and then went to}} 35 spline axle shafts. While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R
5000|$|On February 12, 2005, Eddie Golden {{defeated}} Gluteus Maximus and Nick Diamond three-way {{match for}} Palmetto Pride Championship Wrestling in Columbia, South Carolina. On May 7, at the Mark Curtis Memorial Wrestling Reunion, Golden defeated K.C. Thunder (with The Duke of New York) via disqualification. Golden nearly pinned Thunder {{with a big}} splash {{at the end of}} the match but was pulled off of his opponent by The Duke of New York when he made the cover. While Golden argued with the referee, Thunder then hit him with brass <b>knuckles</b> and <b>pinned</b> him for the win. Thunder seemingly had the match won but the referee found the foreign object after the match and reversed the decision. On July 17, 2005, Eddie and Jimmy Golden defeated The Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton) at an Iron Ring Wrestling show by disqualification. A week later at NWA Rocky Top's [...] "Night of Champions" [...] in Knoxville, Eddie teamed with cousin Bobbie Golden to beat The Turbanators (Jahid and Jaheed) by disqualification. Golden returned to Knoxville for NWA Rocky Top's [...] "Retribution" [...] on August 19 where he and Tim Horner, accompanied by Bobbie Golden, were defeated by The Turbanators in a rematch. Golden defeated K.C. Thunder at a Carolina Championship Wrestling show in Clyde, North Carolina on October 8. On November 6, 2005, Golden wrestled EZ Money at Iron Ring Wrestling's [...] "Afternoon Chaos" [...] in Kingsport, Tennessee. On March 11, 2006, Golden and K.C. Thunder wrestled Iron Cross and Rich Mansfield in USA Main Event.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the <b>pinned</b> nubbin and <b>knuckle</b> link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, <b>knuckle</b> link, <b>pinned</b> nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given. Further research and development needs to be conducted on these seven concepts with larger sample sizes and in varied conditions...|$|R
2500|$|The Mask vs. Hair {{match between}} L.A. Park and El Mesías, {{which had been}} billed as the top match of the event, took place next, with L.A. Park being {{accompanied}} to the ring by his son El Hijo de L.A. Park and the wheelchair-bound Pierroth, neither of whom were working for AAA. Just like in their previous bout at December's Guerra de Titanes, both wrestlers were bloodied and L.A. Park's mask was torn to pieces during the brawl around the arena. With the match in his control following a Skull Bomb and a topé suicida, Park pulled out a table from under the ring, set it up inside the ring and climbed {{on top of it}} for his signature dance, but was then surprised by a diving spear through the table from El Mesías, which was however only good for a two count. El Mesías followed up with a double knee backbreaker and a Mesías Splash for another two count, before locking Park in a sharpshooter. Eventually, Park managed to reach the ropes, but El Mesías pulled him back {{to the center of the}} ring and re-applied the hold. Park feigned submission by lightly tapping El Mesías on the back, which led to him releasing the hold as he believed he had won the match. El Mesías climbed to the top rope to celebrate his [...] "win" [...] and when referee Piero tried to explain that Park had not in fact submitted, El Mesías swung his leg back and accidentally kicked him in the head. Park took advantage of the distraction, hit El Mesías with brass <b>knuckles,</b> made the <b>pin</b> and scored a three count to win the match. After the match, El Mesías had his hair shaved off with L.A. Park mocking Marisela Peña Roldan, who was seated in the front row. At this point the event had lasted over three and a half hours, which led to many in attendance leaving the arena after the match, not sticking around for the main event of the evening.|$|R
