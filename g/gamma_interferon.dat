2500|$|The BCG vaccine {{can make}} cattle {{sensitive}} to the tuberculin skin test after vaccination. [...] this means the animal may have a positive result, {{even though it is}} not actually infected with M. bovis (a [...] "false positive‟). In parallel with developing the vaccine, Defra are developing a test to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (so-called [...] "DIVA" [...] test). This test is based on <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> blood test technology. [...] The intention is that when necessary, it can be used alongside the tuberculin skin test to confirm whether a positive skin test is caused by infection or vaccination. This is critical because without this differentiation, the UK could not be declared officially free of bTB, which is required by a 1964 European Economic Community directive for international trade. Given that in 2014 there is still no bTB vaccine for cattle that does not interfere with the tuberculin tests, such vaccination is prohibited under EU law.|$|E

50|$|Generally, a {{proportion}} of immature thymus-derived lymphocytes differentiate into mature CD4+ T-cells which produce {{a certain amount of}} cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon.</b> To attack tumor cells and viruses, CD-4 cells coordinate the overall immune response and help activate CD8 T-lymphocytes. Often called “effector” or “cytotoxic” T-cells, CD-8+ T-lymphocytes they respond to intracellular pathogens and cancer cells. Under viral attack CD-4+ T-cells fail to mature, fail to produce IL-2 and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon,</b> and consequently fail to coordinate CD-8 responses to viruses. LTCI increases the production of CD-4+ T-cells and can subsequently overcome this immunosuppression.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{main problem}} in the {{follow-up}} of patients receiving organ allografts is the early differential diagnosis of rejection episodes and infections. Serum levels of <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma,</b> a marker of T-lymphocyte activity, were determined with an immunoradiometric assay, specific for biologically active <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> and sufficiently sensitive (20 Ü/l) for the determination of circulating <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma.</b> Neopterin, a pteridine released from stimulated macrophages, was determined by radioimmunoassay. Both rejection crises and infections are accompanied by distinct increases of serum neopterin (median values 124 and 128 nmol/l; N = = 98). <b>Interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> levels are elevated {{for a short period}} one or two days earlier, the maximal values during infections (median 430 U/l, ränge 120 — 1220 U/l, N = 25) being higher than those during rejection episodes (median 120 U/l, ränge < 20 — 330 U/l, N = 73). Each rise of <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> was followed by an increase of neopterin, but not every neopterin increase was preceded by a <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> peak. Neither of these parameters showed an increase during deterioratiön of kidney function due to cyclosporin toxicity. The determination of <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma,</b> a lymphokine involved in the activation of alloreactivity, reflecting T-cell Stimulation, and the measurement of neopterin, a secretory product of activated macrophages, allows the simple, quick and reliable monitoring of the immune Status of transplant recipients.

40|$|Introduction: Tuberculosis {{is still}} a serious public health problem. To {{decrease}} {{the number of cases}} of active tuberculosis in populations of low and intermediate incidence, a rapid diagnosis and effective treatment is necessary. The tuberculin test is the recommended method of screening, but there are well-known limitations. Since 2001, the <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays have emerged, being considered useful in the diagnosis of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and already widely used in adults. Objectives: Summarize the available information on <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays, particularly with regard to the technique; advantages in the diagnosis of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis; sensitivity and specificity in the pediatric population; characterization of interfering factors; and their significance of monitoring of tuberculostatic treatment. Development: <b>Interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays are immunoassays that measure <b>Interferon</b> <b>Gamma</b> Release Assays response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. These tests have been applied in paediatrics population and in regions with different prevalence rates of tuberculosis, in order to compare them with the tuberculin skin test in regard to sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Its usefulness as a means of screening in Paediatrics has limitations. Studies are needed at national level to identify how tuberculin skin test and <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays must be articulated. Currently, <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays only complement tuberculin skin test...|$|R
