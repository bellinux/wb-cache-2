50|$|Offsets can {{be defined}} as {{provisions}} to an import agreement, between an exporting foreign company, or possibly a government acting as intermediary, and an importing public entity, that oblige the exporter to undertake activities in order to satisfy a second objective of the importing entity, distinct from the acquisition of the goods and/or services that form the core transaction. The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation. Offset agreements often involve trade in military goods and services and are alternatively called: <b>industrial</b> <b>compensations,</b> <b>industrial</b> cooperation, offsets, industrial and regional benefits, balances, juste retour or equilibrium, to define mechanisms more complex than counter-trade.Counter-trade can also be considered one of the many forms of defense offset, to compensate a purchasing country. The main difference between a generic offset and counter-trade, both common practices in the international defense trade, is the involvement of money. In counter-trade, goods are paid through barters or other mechanisms without the exchange of money, while in other defense offsets money is the measure and the medium of exchange.|$|R

As OB is defined every kind of <b>industrial</b> <b>compensation</b> according to which the productive units of a country - buyer participate in the domestic coproduction of procured defence equipment from foreign sellers. The scope of this PhD dissertation is to evaluate the usefulness of OB both technologically and economically {{as well as to}} examine whether this approach could be maintained, abolished of just amended. The historical presentation of OB at Greece during the last 30 years is {{the first part of the}} study. This includes their evolution, their objectives and the agreed guidelines for the anticipated transactions while an effort is done to correlate them with other forms of procurements through the necessary adaptations. The next subject is the industrialization in the developing countries and what seem to be the respective future strategies. Special analysis is given at the technology transfer which is the substance of OB transactions. Moreover emphasis is paid at the relations of OB with the defence industry where nowadays are mainly located their applications. All the opportunities and the success factors are examined here and this remains the final point for the survival of the OB policy while similar emphasis is given at the development of Hellenic defence industries which use the OB as a leverage. The followed methodology is quite polymorphic: documentation, questionnaire, interviews, observational participation and Delphi method. There are also controlled the reliability and credibility of the research process as well as in parallel the characteristics of the sample (almost 100 % of the population) are completely recorded. At the end of this section are written the inevitable research restrictions and the total evaluation of the research effort. Next subject covered in the dissertation are the analysis of the research findings and an effort is done in order to explain the respective facts in the Hellenic environment. In any case cannot be omitted the mentioning of future strategies, the time horizon and the orientation of OB as well as the significant pending OB obligations of many sellers. Finally comes the synopsis of the conclusions while specific proposals for the future national technological policy together with the strategic R & D have been preceded. The definite continuation of OB policy is clearly adopted but it should be accompanied by corresponding improvements at the processes and follow - up levels because the historical experience must be transformed to certain clarified actions. ...|$|E

40|$|Depuis {{longtemps}} on est à la recherche d'un substitut à la grève traditionnelle qui sauvegarderait le recours à l'utilisation de pressions économiques dans les négociations collectives et en même temps éviterait les inconvénients dont souffrent les consommateurs. Cette étude a pour but d'étudier l'origine, la nature, les avantages et les inconvénients d'une formule qui a été préconisée : la grève-sans-arrêt-de-travail (statutory strike). The {{search for}} a means to eliminate {{the impact of a}} strike on the public without weakening the bargaining power of both management and union at the bargaining table gave rise to the statutory strike formula, also known as the non-stoppage strike formula. ORIGINThe idea was first suggested in 1949 by two Harvard professors : LeRoy Marceau and Richard A. Musgrave. (1) The following year, Professor George W. Goble (2) defined a concrete way to use the idea and in 1953, Neil W. Chamberlain (3), the well-known Yale economist, approved the principles of the formula, defining his personal view on the way to use it. In 1959, David B. McCalmont (4) published several articles on the subject without knowing at that time that the idea was not a new one. NATUREDespite these different approaches, one can draw up a profile of the Non-Stoppage Strike Formula, taking into account the four given sources :— there is no work stoppage;— the public does not have to suffer any production or service interruption;— the parties are supposed {{to be in the same}} relative bargaining positions as if the workers had walked out;— the parties are supposed to impose on each other the same economic burden as if they were involved in a regular strike. The basic hypothesis of that formula is as follows :« Aside from the inconvenience which the public suffers, the only direct result of a strike is to inflict an economic loss on both the company and the workers. It costs them both money » ( [...] .) « If therefore a system could be devised which would permit the union to inflict the identical loss upon the company without a work stoppage, the bargaining function of the strike would be preserved, yet the conflict with the public interest would be avoided.  » (5) ELEMENTSSetting up of the FormulaMarceau and Musgrave as well as Chamberlain propose the use of the formula when a conflict between management and the union is judged by the State as being an emergency dispute. The law would then force the parties to use the non-stoppage strike formula. Goble suggests the existence of a law defining the method of application of the system, available on a voluntary basis to the parties involved in the conflict. Finally, McCalmont thinks that there is no need for any legislation concerning the non-stoppage strike formula. The system could be used following the will of the parties. However, the State or any public intervention would be avoided except where agreed upon by the parties. It would be more appropriate to name the first case « statutory strike » and the two others, « non-stoppage strike ». We will use that latter term. Economic PenaltiesDuring a work stoppage, the workers are willing to give up their income in order to force the employer to accept their demands. The strike without work stoppage takes that fact into account. The workers keep on working though they receive only a part of their income. On the other hand, the employer gives up a part of the company's earnings. They negotiate under that pressure until they reach an agreement. There is no work stoppage. The same economic pressure as in a regular work stoppage forces the parties towards an agreement. How can it be done ?Marceau and Musgrave recommend requiring the company « to pay out (for all work performed) at a rate so high that the company would stand in the same profit and loss position in which it would have stood, had the work stoppage gone ahead » and the workers would receive « a rate so low that, in actual fact, they would be under the same economic pressure that a strike would exert ». (6) Since they keep on working, they must receive a little more than that if one is to avoid placing the parties in a worse position than if the workers had really walked out. Goble would prefer to retain 25 per cent of the workers' income and 25 per cent of the managers' income plus the net profits of the company operating during a non-stoppage strike. In order to maintain the relative bargaining power of the parties, Chamberlain proposes the retention of 50 per cent of the workers' income and 50 per cent of the fixed costs of the company during the non-stoppage strike. Taking into account the fact that the employer does not lose his market and that the workers have no equal advantage, another penalty would be added to the employer by retaining all his net profits. The penalties suggested by McCalmont are much alike those of Marceau and Musgrave. They would be as follows : 50 per cent of the owner's income and 50 per cent of the difference between the company's income with and without a work stoppage ; the latter amount being defined in the expired collective agreement to avoid the problems of setting it up. Use of the Trust Fund ReceiptsOn this specific point, Marceau and Musgrave, Chamberlain, and McCalmont suggest that these amounts be retained each week during the non-stoppage strike negotiations until the agreement is reached. Goble adds the possibility of the parties recovering all the money withheld if they settle within 90 days. If not, another period of the same length with the same penalties would begin until the agreement is reached. Musgrave, Chamberlain and McCalmont would use these amounts to finance public services in the community or to help finance the general needs of the government (strike tax). Marceau suggests using the money withheld to pay retroactive payments to the parties, hoping that this will bring them to agree upon the formula. EXPERIENCESAs far as we have been able to determine, there is only one collective agreement which includes a non-stoppage strike clause. It was signed by Dunbar Furniture Corporation (Indiana) and Local 222 of the Upholsterers International Union (AFL-CIO) on May 1, 1964. It can be described as follows :« The strike-work provisions are activated on receipt of written notice of a strike or lockout. The provisions immediately ban such action; reinstate the terms of the basic contract (whose expiration is a condition for a strike or lockout); and stipulate that the ban will continue during the first twelve payroll weeks after the notice is received. Until a settlement is reached within this period, if it is, half of the weekly earnings of bargaining unit employees (including holiday and vacation pay that may become due) is withheld by the company. This money is placed in a 'strike work trust fund', for which the First Bank of Berne is the fiduciary. The company also turns over to the fund an amount equal to the total withheld from the employees' pay ». When the basic contract dispute is settled, the company and its employees can regain the money turned over to the trust according to the following schedule :Settlement during the       proportion of money returned   first 6 weeks                         100 %    7 th — 9 th week                      75 %    10 th — 11 th week                  50 %    12 th week                         25 %   After the 12 th week               noneIf the twelfth week ends without a settlement, the basic contract can be terminated on written notice and a regular strike or lockout can begin. If such notice is not received by the end of the first following week (the thirteenth), the contract is renewed automatically and without change. In this case the contract is not terminable until a year from its original, pre-notice expiration date. (7) Since their agreement on that formula, the parties have renegotiated their contract but without having to use the strike-work provisions. There is another experience of non-stoppage strike which took place in Miami, Florida. It was not part of the agreement but was a decision taken by the parties after three days of regular strike. (8) The Miami Transit Company and its striking employees agreed to provide free bus service for the city. The bus drivers agreed to provide their services free and the employer was to pay for fuel and maintenance of the buses. The drivers were not to receive any subsidies during the period other than those payments authorized by the union. The system worked for only three days and ended because the bus company president charged that his investigators had found some drivers accepting tips from riders. They returned to a formal strike. (9) This case is so particular that it could not be extended to other sectors of our economy. It is presented for its originality rather than for its possible application elsewhere. PLAN ADVANTAGES AS ESTIMATED BY THE PROMOTORSThe great winner with the formula is the public because it does not have to change its practices as there is no work stoppage. However, in the opinion of the proposers, both the workers and management gain with the formula. Let us now turn to the advantages for them. (10) For the workers :— they receive a bigger pay during the non-stoppage strike than if they had walked out;— the demoralization which comes from being idle, as required by the regular strike, is not present;— the bad feeling and dangers of the picket line are eliminated;— the risk of the company beating the strike by employing strike breakers is avoided;— the bargaining power of the union is not weakened since they are supposed to maintain the same economic pressure as if they had gone on strike;— It is an excellent occasion for the union to improve its public image. For the employer :— the damage to property, which sometimes results from a picket line, are eliminated;— all expenses incidental to a shut down are eliminated;— the disruption which comes to the operation of the business, to its market position and to the satisfying of customers is prevented;— the temptation to resort to unpopular methods for breaking the strike is not present;— the good reputation of the company is maintained since it is able to fulfill its obligations. It seems that each of the parties gains with the formula. Let us now take a look at its weaknesses. COMMENTS ON THE NON-STOPPAGE STRIKE FORMULAThe Nature of the FormulaInsufficient knowledge of the nature of the strike. The promotors of the formula postulate that the strike has only an economic finality and that the greatest damage inflicted on the employer during a work stoppage is the immediate loss of profit. So saying, they take into account only one dimension of the strike. They omit its social, psychological and political functions. The immediate loss of profit is not the worst thing that can happen to an employer during a work stoppage. The employer fears the long-run impact rather more than the « here and now » consequences of the strike. He fears, among other things, the loss of his market. On the side of the workers, sometimes the traditional strike plays an important role of defrustration. Insufficient knowledge of the nature of union activity. The non-stoppage strike formula ignores the role of unionism. The strike is the perfect way to enhance the workers' cohesion and solidarity. If one is to remove the right to walk out, then, by the same token, the union loses what makes its strength. Modified bargaining powerOne cannot know if the formula maintains the relative bargaining power of the parties. What makes the strength of a party at the bargaining table is a set of factors. Some can be expressed in money terms but others cannot. The formula fails by converting all of these factors into money terms. Moreover, it reduces the penalties for both parties compared to the traditional strike. The smaller the penalty, the greater the will to resist and the longer the conflict. Public opinion does not intervene since it is not disturbed by a work stoppage. Danger of bad consequencesThe authors agree on the fact that the right to strike is not permanently lost since the parties can remove such a no-stoppage clause from the agreement in later collective bargaining. Once agreed upon, however, it seems that it will not be removed. On the other hand, the workers have to use their right to strike if they wish to convince the employer and themselves of their strength. With the formula, it seems that they will lose their ability to walk out. Once embarked, it becomes a vicious circle. Such a formula can incite the rank and file workers to slow down if they are not convinced of the pressure they exert during a non-stoppage strike. Also, the company would be attracted by the idea of cutting its product prices since it has to give up all its net profits. There would be, finally, the possibility that the workers would quit their jobs as they would receive only « a half day's pay for a full day's work ». Problems emerging from the implementation of the formulaDuring a strike without work stoppage, the workers are willing to renounce a part of their income. What happens to the workers hired once it has begun ? If they receive full pay, it will affect the moral of the other workers. If they receive only a part of it, they will not accept work there. Since the Marceau and Musgrave article in 1949, there has been only one agreement containing such a clause. Moreover, according to the views of the president of the company, sooner or later, industrial and union leaders are going « to have to find a better way to resolve industrial disputes ». Details of ApplicationSetting upThree means of setting up the formula are proposed : a coercive law, a permissive law and a decision of the parties without any legislation. The first would be effective in avoiding the appearance of the strike but the conflict would remain. The two others leave the parties free to choose the formula or not. By doing so, one can be sure that it will not be very useful since nobody believes in its effectiveness. Determination of the penaltiesThe penalties imposed on the parties should be determined by public referees (Marceau and Musgrave, Chamberlain, Goble). The employers will resist such intrusions in their private affairs. What about the determination of the net profit ? What will motivate the employer to operate efficiently if he is to give up all his net profit ?Goble proposes retaining 25 per cent of the manager's income. Will they accept a worse situation than during a regular strike ? What is to prevent the company from distributing at the end of the year a bonus covering that lost income ?As far as the Dunbar Formula is concerned, it is simple, but its equity is doubtful. Use of the trust fund receiptsThe Dunbar formula seems to encourage the parties to settle early (within six weeks) since they would then recover all the money withheld. In the other case, there is no such pressure. Marceau's idea of using the money to make retroactive payments is not valuable as there would no longer be a penalty. To sum up, let us say that if we stick to the idea, we give an unworkable means of imposing penalties, and if we define easy means of imposing penalties, we stand away from the formula. AnnexeDUNBAR FURNITURE STRIKE WORK AGREEMENTThis Strike Work Agreement, made and entered into 20 th day of May, 1964, by and between the Dunbar Furniture Corporation of Indiana, Berne, Indiana, its successors or assigns, hereinafter called the company. andthe Upholsterers' International Union of North America affiliated with the AFL-CIO, hereinafter designated as the Union acting through its agency, Upholsterers' Furniture and Novelty Workers' Local Union No. 222, and under charter from the said Union, for itself and in behalf of the employees now employed and hereinafter employed by the company and collectively designated herein as the employees, hereinafter called the union. LABOR AGREEMENTThe company and the union have a Collective Bargaining Agreement and it is agreed that this Strike Work Agreement and the attached Fiduciary Agreement are subsidiary agreements to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. PROCEDURENOTICEIn case the union decides to strike or the company decides to have a lockout after a collective bargaining agreement expires it is agreed that the Strike Work procedure as outlined in the agreement will be in effect. The union will send official written notice of the decision to strike to the company or the company will send official written notice of the lockout to the local union. Starting with the first payroll week after the notice is received the Strike Work procedure will be in effect as outlined in this agreement. The collective bargaining agreement is reinstated and will continue; in force for the entire Strike Work period. WORK DEDUCTIONSThere will be no stoppage of work. All employees will continue to work during the Strike Work period. Onehalf of the earnings of all employees in the unit will be withheld and placed in the Strike Work Trust Fund in the custody of the Bank named in the Fiduciary Agreement. The company will place in the fund each week an amount of money equal to the total amount paid by all employees that week. PERIODS — REFUNDSFIRST PERIOD — SIX WEEKS — ALL MONEY RETURNEDIf the Strike Work is settled inside of six weeks, all of the money will be returned to the employees and the company. The bank will donate its services. SECOND PERIOD — THREE WEEKS — 75 % RETURNEDIf the Strike Work is settled in the next three weeks, 75 % of the money paid will be returned to the employees and the company, less 10 c per check issued in the distribution process. THIRD PERIOD — TWO WEEKS — 50 % RETURNEDIf the Strike Work is settled in the next two weeks, 50 % of the money will be returned to the employees and the company, less 10 c per check issued in the distribution process. FOURTH PERIOD— ONE WEEK — 25 % RETURNED If the Strike Work is settled in the next one week, 25 % of the money will be returned to the employees and the company, less 10 c per check issued in the distribution process. OLD FASHIONED STRIKE OR LOCKOUTIf the Strike Work has not been settled by the end of the fourth period (12 th week) then no money will be refunded. The Strike Work Agreement and the Collective Bargaining Agreement may then be terminated and also there may be an old fashioned strike or lockout by written notice of either party to the other. AGREEMENT RENEWEDIf no such notice has been received by either party at the end of the 13 th week after the Strike work started then the last agreement will be automatically renewed without change for one year. The expiration date will then be one year from the written date of expiration in the last written agreement. ARBITRATIONAny dispute as to the meaning or application of the agreement between the company and the union or with the fiduciary that cannot be settled otherwise will be arbitrated except only as is provided in Article IX of the fiduciary agreement, if either party to the dispute so requests. The arbitration will be under the rules and procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement. RULESThe following rules will be in effect with the start of the first payroll week of a strike or lockout under this Strike Work Agreement. RETIREESIn case an employee is eligible to retire and does retire, then the money that he has paid into the fund will be refunded to him when he retires. Written proof and authorization will be given to the Fiduciary in jointly signed statement. SICK OR INJUREDIf an employee is sick or injured and received benefits under the UIU Health and Welfare Fund or Workmen's Compensation or other statutory <b>industrial</b> <b>compensation</b> funds, the benefits so received will not be considered as wages. The money that he has paid into the fund will remain there pending his return. In case it is proved that he is totally disabled then the money that he has paid into the fund will be returned to him when he retires. The Fiduciary will be given proof and authorization as outlined in A above. When an employee that has been sick or injured returns to work, then he will receive a refund or will additional money so that he will pay the same percent of his wages as other employees. The payments, if any, can be divided into four weekly instalments. QUITSIn case an employee quits or is discharged during the time a Strike Work is going on, he will forfeit and lose all claim to any money that he has paid into the fund. If he should be rehired, he will start as a new employee without seniority. If the amount that he had paid into the fund was a smaller percent of his weekly wage than others paid, he will pay the difference before starting to work, to the company and the company will deposit the money so received in the fund. NO STRIKE OR SLOW DOWNIt is agreed that there will be no strike stoppage or slow down or restrictions of output during the time that the Strike Work is in effect.

50|$|Awareness of asbestos-related {{diseases}} can {{be found}} in the early 1900s, when London doctor H. Montague Murray conducted a post mortem exam on a young asbestos factory worker who died in 1899. Dr. Murray gave testimony on this death in connection with an <b>industrial</b> disease <b>compensation</b> hearing. The post-mortem confirmed the presence of asbestos in the lung tissue, prompting Dr. Murray to express as an expert opinion his belief that the inhalation of asbestos dust had at least contributed to, if not actually caused, the death of the worker.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes and {{interprets the}} effects of the significant changes to the workers <b>compensation,</b> <b>industrial</b> and related laws that occurred in the early 1990 s in Western Australia. These could be characterised as motivated by a desire by the then Coalition Government to reduce access to legal representation in compensation claims, limit the potential of workers to claim damages for negligence and reduce the use of collective bargaining mechanisms to resolve industrial disputes. Arguably, the common philosophical themes were to individualise the relationship between employer and employee and to reduce the bargaining strength of workers. In general terms, these themes were presented under the guise of flexible workplace relations. Whether these outcomes were achieved is not the subject of this analysis, rather, the aim is to show that one (perhaps unintended) consequence of the legislative changes of the early 1990 s was to create significant areas of overlap in various employment related laws. These areas of overlap have led to some difficulties within the various tribunals involved in the resolution of employment related disputes. Over the last decade, the issues arising from the 1990 s amendments have crystallized into important principles, which are discussed in this work. The thesis of this dissertation is that an examination of the development of the <b>industrial</b> and workers <b>compensation</b> laws in Western Australia in the 1990 s establishes sufficient commonality between the <b>industrial</b> relations and <b>compensation</b> systems to warrant the rationalisation of these two jurisdictions...|$|R

For workers, there are income losses {{when they are}} out of work due to work-related disorders. Furthermore, for organizations and factories, the <b>industrial</b> accident <b>compensation</b> is also an unexpected rise in production costs., Thus, we come to a conclusion that work-related disorder is a major and/or serious societal issue.|$|R

It gives a basic {{description of the scheme}} in an attempt to provide a birds-eye view as to how it operates. It aims to provide guidance not only for tribunal members, but also for claimants and the wide range of advisors now offering assistance in the bringing of such claims. However, it does not deal with those questions which have been exclusively reserved for the medical authorities (e. g. relating to the assessment of disablement). Nor does it consider the few peripheral matters which can only be determined by the Secretary of State. In both of these areas not only are laymen excluded from the decision-making, but also hearings are much less common. There may then be less need for guidance. This article therefore, by examining only those questions faced by S. S. A. T. s, does not seek to deal with other, at times important, issues determined elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{magnetron}} sputtering of a metallic target {{in a mixture}} of inert and reactive gas is now widely applied for compound deposition at high rates. It has been shown that problems due to arcing and the hysteresis of the process can be overcome by pulse sputtering and appropriate process control. Another important aspect is the shift of deposition parameters and reactive working point due to the target erosion. For <b>industrial</b> application <b>compensation</b> of the shift is desired to achieve constant deposition conditions and homogeneous film properties during target life. For this different possibilities exist. In the paper reactive sputtering of alumina films using stationary sputtering with the Double Ring Magnetron (DRM) is reported. Ongoing target erosion is compensated by using the movable magnet systems of the DRM to keep magnetic field strength at the target constant during target erosion. This technique has the advantage of constant electric discharge parameters during target life and therefore ensures constant energetic substrate bombardment. Results with respect to constancy of deposition rate, film thickness distribution and film properties are discussed. Furthermore process stability and efficacy of the hidden anode are evaluated throughout target life...|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that while market-driven forces are important, institutional frameworks also influence the use of deferred <b>compensation.</b> Specifically, <b>industrial</b> relations have been shown to influence the use of deferred <b>compensation.</b> <b>Industrial</b> relations in Germany are characterized by a dual structure of employee representation with both works councils and unions (Huebler and Jirjahn 2003). While works councils provide a highly developed mechanism for codetermination at the firm level, unions typically negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers’ associations on a broad industrial level. Zwick (2011) finds that the incidence of a works council in a firm and the coverage by a collective bargaining agreement increase the probability that the firm has a seniority wage profile steeper than the sector average.|$|R

In this article it is shown how the compensation factor, required for (one-step) DA depends on material, process and geometrical parameters. For this an analytical bar stretchbending model was used. A compensation factor is not required when DA is applied iteratively and the products geometrical accuracy is improved further. This was demonstrated on an <b>industrial</b> part.

40|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{is a major}} and entirely {{preventable}} public health problem. Effective prevention of this disorder {{has yet to be}} achieved in the United States but would improve the overall hearing health of the population more than the treatment of all other otologic disorders combined. Losses that are mild to moderately severe and maximal at 3, 4 or 6 kHz are typical but not pathognomonic. Individual differences in susceptibility are substantial but unpredictable. Hearing conservation programs are now required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for almost all employees whose daily exposure to noise exceeds a time-weighted average of 85 dBA (A-weighted sound pressure level). The permitted exposure level is 90 dBA time-weighted average, above which engineering or administrative controls or hearing protectors are required. Workers with lesser exposures (85 to 90 dBA time-weighted average) who have hearing changes must be similarly protected. Many, but not all, elements of required hearing conservation programs have been specified recently by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Medical supervision and otologic referral are important components of hearing conservation programs because otologic problems other than noise-induced hearing loss are common in <b>industrial</b> populations. <b>Compensation</b> for noise-induced hearing loss, which is awarded through state workers' compensation boards, as well as certain federal sources, varies widely...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a general {{solution to the}} con-touring problem of industrial robot arms, under the constraints of assigned Cartesian velocity and joint torque/acceleration. The proposed solution is an off-line trajectory generation algorithm and, therefore, it possesses significant industrial implications, as no hardware changes are needed for its implementation. According to the proposed method, maximum utility of joint torque/accelera-tion is guaranteed bound to the assigned velocity constraint. In the proposed method, a realizable trajectory is generated from the ob-jective trajectory and it is compensated for delay dynamics using a forward compensator. The proposed method has been experi-mented with Performer MK- 3 s (PMK- 3 s) industrial robot arm in that optimum contouring has been realized.

40|$|By {{extending}} the standard returns to seniority wage regression this paper tries {{to evaluate whether}} workers receive on-the-job compen-sations for skills that are neither completely general nor fully firm-specific. Our framework allows to asses whether the returns to firm tenure estimated in the literature are in fact capturing (part of) the remuneration of skills that are common to a broader set of firms. The issue has relevant implications, particularly {{as far as the}} wage losses associated to exogenous job displacement are considered. Crucial iden-tification information is provided by the data, that allow to obtain unbiased estimation of the returns to district tenure. We do not find evidence that workers in <b>industrial</b> districts receive <b>compensation</b> for skills that are valued at district level. We rather estimate high returns to firm-specific skills, inferring high wage drops in case of exogenous workers’displacement...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} limitation {{to machine}} tool productivity in high-speed operations {{is due to}} inertial vibrations. During strong accelerations, inertial forces generate oscillations that are translated into surface geometrical errors on the machined parts. Machine tools users minimize these problems by reducing machine axes quickness, thus affecting productivity. In this paper the effects of inertial deformations on machine tool accuracy have been studied to evaluate the possibility of adopting a software compensation strategy. The proposed model-based solution, based on a reduced model of the machine tool dynamics, has been tested in a mechatronic simulation environment. In order to meet <b>industrial</b> needs, the <b>compensation</b> scheme {{has been designed to}} allow its implementation on standard numerical controllers. A detailed feasibility analysis has been carried out studying all aspects that can potentially impede the application of such approach. Simulations and some preliminary experimental tests prove the effectiveness of the developed technique on a five-axis machining center...|$|R
40|$|Current {{rationalization}} {{options for}} West Coast groundfish trawl fisheries include significant allocations of harvester quota to processors, justified as compensation for â€œstranded capital. â€ This article discusses {{the origin of}} the concept of stranded capital, its use in other policy settings, preconditions, measurement, and remedies for addressing it. Our main finding is that rationalization of fisheries is unlikely to generate significant processing stranded capital. Most capital involved in fisheries processing is malleable and not likely to be devalued as a result of rationalization. If policy makers nevertheless judge it desirable to consider compensation, a legitimate process would tie compensation to anticipated or demonstrated capital losses. Current policies proposed on the U. S. West Coast to transfer harvester quota are arbitrary and unsupported by empirical estimates of the magnitude of the problem. They are likely to generate important spillover effects that could negate some of the intended benefits of rationalization.
