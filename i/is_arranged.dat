5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
5|$|Although loaned {{to friends}} and family, and {{therefore}} in slight public circulation, Coke's Reports were never formally used during his lifetime. Select cases were published in 1600, containing {{the most famous of}} his decisions and pleadings, while a second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature. The third part, published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.|$|E

5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus {{produces}} a brown spore print. Spores are somewhat fusoid (spindle-shaped) and measure 14–20 by 5–6.5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 28.5–36.5 by 11.5–12.5µm. Cystidia on the pores are flask-shaped (lageniform) to fusiform, and 39.0–45.5 by 7.5–9.0µm, while {{those of the}} stipe (caulocystidia) are fusiform, club-shaped, or cylindrical, measuring 39.0–54.5 x 9.1–13.5µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of L.holopus. The cap cuticle <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> {{in the form of}} a cutis—with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface.|$|E

5|$|Most {{living things}} that are {{visible to the naked}} eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> in complex chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of {{protactinium}} are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic structure {{composed of}} double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural {{to that of other}} actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E
5|$|Since {{their first}} match in 2005, 87 players have {{represented}} Australia in Twenty20 Internationals. A Twenty20 International {{is an international}} cricket match between two representative teams of ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). A Twenty20 International is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. The list <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> in the order in which each player won his first Twenty20 cap. Where more than one player won his first Twenty20 cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname.|$|E
