They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

Phillips said that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, call our friends, and actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> song to be the battle cry again.

Bilal had previously worked with Glasper on the latter's 2012 album Black Radio. For the song [...] "Back to Love", Bilal originally programmed the music's drums on his Logic, but decided to record them live after bringing in other musicians at Pine Studios in Philadelphia. While recording [...] "Astray", he persuaded his drummer to play in the parking lot and record him live, which he recalled in an interview for The Huffington Post: [...] "I just had this feeling in my head like, 'man, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> shit to feel big!' And when I would park my car in the parking lot, the acoustics in there made you feel like was a Catholic church with all of the sounds echoing off of everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, {{producer}} David Heyman asked Radcliffe {{to audition}} {{for the role of}} Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the movie's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, [...] "This is what <b>I</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> is Harry Potter", after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, and after several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling also endorsed the selection saying, [...] "I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry." [...] Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-movie contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that.|$|E

[...] The action followed several days of rumours and a PC caucus meeting in which that party agreed to accept the Wildrose members. Smith said that several conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared much common ground, particularly on fiscal issues. Ultimately, she concluded that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. [...] "If you’re going to be the official Opposition leader," [...] she said, [...] "you have to really want to take down the government and really take down the premier.

500|$|Wentz {{referred}} to [...] "I Don't Care" [...] as a [...] "narcissist's anthem" [...] {{that addresses the}} current generation's short attention span. Wentz further explored the subjects of narcissism and apathy in [...] "(Coffee's for Closers)", as Stump explained, [...] "The past decade has been totally about 'me.' It's totally about 'Oh, I'm sad. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this.</b> I know somebody who knows this person. Me me me me me,' so that's what that song is about." [...] Additionally, [...] "America's Suitehearts" [...] discusses society's fixation with celebrities {{and the desire to}} let them do no wrong. [...] "27" [...] explores the hedonistic lifestyles common in rock and roll music. The title is a reference to the 27 Club, a group of influential musicians, including Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, and Jim Morrison, who all {{died at the age of}} 27. Wentz felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle, and was [...] "stoked" [...] to make it to his 28th birthday. Stump added [...] "There was a countdown clock and everything.

500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

[...] She {{expressed an interest in}} designing new diseases, perhaps non-fatal ones, to be introduced to the game so she could study how risk is viewed, how rumors would spread, and how public health notices are handled. She added that Blizzard made such notices in the original outbreak, but kept changing its position as it could not effectively deal with the problem. She commented that she did not believe it would ruin gameplay, as World of Warcraft dealt with health challenges in combat, and that games set in medieval times had such health risk. She argued that if researchers and developers worked together, it could be fun. While Blizzard was initially excited about the proposition, it became less outwardly excited over time, though never rejected it. She has been in contact with other developers, hoping to conduct the simulation in games similar to World of Warcraft.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon began {{recording}} {{her second}} album with Ethan Johns in late 2003, and via her website stated she was excited {{with the direction}} the album was going, {{even though it was}} very, very mellow and sad. Gordon finished recording with Johns in early 2004 and stated that she had named it Even the Sunbeams, but little more about the album was ever revealed. A few months later, Gordon admitted she was unhappy with the album and she wasn't going to release it. The only song that surfaced from this recording session was [...] "Lighter on the Moon", which was available on Nina's MySpace site. In April 2006, Gordon stated in the Chicago Reader, [...] "It's a really sad and really slow record. I guess that's how I was feeling at the time, but when I sorta snapped out of that, I thought, 'I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> to be the album I put out next.' It's really a lovely record, but it didn't have the spirit of the records I've made in the past." [...] Some songs were re-recorded and included in her next album.

Then. Lopez felt that Jackson's [...] "clear and spacious" [...] records made her feel a [...] "certain way". She said, [...] "It has such a {{beautiful}} quality on it, and every time I looked at a record , it would be engineered and mixed by Bruce Swedien. I was like, 'Who is this guy? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> guy.' So I tracked him down and he was like, 'I want to do something with her. I know exactly what she needs. I'm coming in.' And it made a huge difference." [...] Lopez worked closely with longtime producer Cory Rooney on the album. Discussing the process, Rooney stated, [...] "This is by far the best record that I've ever worked on or done [...] In the beginning of the recording [...] she said it's important that she makes a record that is a few notches above everything else she did. She wanted to show growth musically and vocally." [...] Other producers Lopez worked with primarily were Troy Oliver, Loren Hill and Dan Shea.

2500|$|Prior to {{the live}} session, Miles Davis had already {{established}} {{a reputation as}} one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as [...] "The Jazz Corner of the World", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating [...] "Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [...] For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way : the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [...] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'" [...] Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.|$|E
