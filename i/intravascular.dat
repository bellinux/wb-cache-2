5|$|Disseminated <b>intravascular</b> {{coagulation}} generally resolves {{when the}} underlying causes are treated, but supportive measures are often required. For instance, if the platelet count drops significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation, another {{complication}} of rhabdomyolysis {{and other forms}} of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing platelet count or prolongation of the prothrombin time. The diagnosis can be confirmed with standard blood tests for DIC, such as D-dimer.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary brachytherapy) such as the cervix, uterus or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal brachytherapy) such as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface brachytherapy) such as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (<b>intravascular</b> brachytherapy) {{for the treatment of}} coronary in-stent restenosis.|$|E
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatality}} rate highly {{depends on the}} severity of the bites and some other factors. Deaths can be exceptional and probably occur in less than 15% of all untreated cases (usually in 2–4 days from complications following blood volume deficit and a disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulopathy), although some reports show that severe envenomations have a 52% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme creatine kinase and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation. High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally <b>intravascular</b> hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
25|$|Physiologically, {{research}} has linked pre-eclampsia {{to the following}} physiologic changes: alterations in {{the interaction between the}} maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, endothelial cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among vasoactive substances, decreased <b>intravascular</b> volume, and disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Varicose veins. Common {{complaint}} {{caused by}} relaxation of the venous smooth muscle and increased <b>intravascular</b> pressure.|$|E
25|$|In 5 percent cases, it {{may result}} in ARDS (acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome), DIC (disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation), etc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intravascular</b> bubbles cause {{clumping}} of {{red blood}} cells, platelets are used up, {{white blood cells}} activated, vascular permeability is increased.|$|E
25|$|Increased urinary frequency. A common complaint, {{caused by}} {{increased}} <b>intravascular</b> volume, elevated glomerular filtration rate, and compression of the bladder by the expanding uterus.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} kidney disease, {{diabetes}} mellitus, high blood pressure, reduced <b>intravascular</b> volume, {{or who are}} elderly {{are at increased risk}} of developing CIN after exposure to iodinated contrast.|$|E
25|$|The {{phases of}} the {{leukocyte}} extravasation depicted in the schema are: approach, capture, rolling, activation, binding, strengthening of the binding and spreading, <b>intravascular</b> creeping, paracellular migration or transcellular migration.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin {{has been}} studied in sepsis to reduce diffuse <b>intravascular</b> {{coagulation}} and other outcomes. It has not been found to confer any benefit in critically ill people with sepsis.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, melena, hemoptysis, hematuria and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or anuria {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of <b>intravascular</b> hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{treatment}} {{is the most}} important factor in a favorable prognosis. A delay in treatment greater than six hours or the presence of peritonitis, sepsis, hypotension, or disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation are negative prognostic indicators.|$|E
25|$|Patients with fulminant infections, disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation, HELLP syndrome, pancreatitis, {{liver disease}} and other active {{inflammatory}} conditions may have reduced ADAMTS13 activity but almost never a relevant severe ADAMTS13 deficiency <10% of the normal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intravascular</b> transfusion—blood transfused into fetal {{umbilical}} vein—This is {{the method}} of choice since the late 1980s, and more effective than intraperitoneal transfusion. A sample of fetal blood can be taken from the umbilical vein prior to the transfusion.|$|E
25|$|Several microangiopathic diseases, {{including}} disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies, {{present with}} pathognomonic (diagnostic) {{red blood cell}} fragments called schistocytes. These pathologies generate fibrin strands that sever red blood cells {{as they try to}} move past a thrombus.|$|E
25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with <b>intravascular</b> {{contrast}} {{may be able}} {{to identify}} abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an <b>intravascular</b> catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} hyperaldosteronism develops {{due to the}} decreased blood volume. The high aldosterone levels {{causes the}} kidneys to avidly retain Na+ (to correct the <b>intravascular</b> volume depletion), and excrete increased amounts of K+ into the urine (resulting in a low blood level of potassium).|$|E
25|$|Urea with σ=.59 was {{introduced}} in 1956 due to low molecular weight and slow penetration of BBB. However, it can cause rebound effects and side effects such as <b>intravascular</b> hemolysis and phlebitis. When Urea is administered, the dosage is 1.5 g/kg or 0.5 g/kg (for elderly).|$|E
25|$|Transfusions {{with large}} amounts of red blood cells, whether due to severe hemorrhaging and/or {{transfusion}} inefficacy (see above), can lead to an inclination for bleeding. The mechanism {{is thought to be}} due to disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation, along with dilution of recipient platelets and coagulation factors. Close monitoring and transfusions with platelets and plasma is indicated when necessary.|$|E
25|$|Decreased {{platelet}} numbers {{may be due}} {{to various}} causes, including insufficient production (e.g., in myelodysplastic syndrome or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system (immune thrombocytopenic purpura/ITP), and consumption due to various causes (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP, hemolytic-uremic syndrome/HUS, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria/PNH, disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation/DIC, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/HIT). Most consumptive conditions lead to platelet activation, and some are associated with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intravascular</b> {{fluorescence}} is a catheter-based {{medical imaging}} technique that uses fluorescence to detect high-risk features of atherosclerosis and unhealed vascular stent devices. Plaque autofluorescence {{has been used in}} a first-in-man study in coronary arteries in combination with optical coherence tomography. Molecular agents has been also used to detect specific features, such as stent fibrin accumulation and enzymatic activity related to artery inflammation.|$|E
25|$|USS {{can present}} {{similar to the}} {{following}} diseases which have to be excluded: fulminant infections, disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans syndrome, the typical and atypical form of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, pre-eclampsia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), cancer that is often accompanied with metastasis, kidney injury, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and side effects from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT), {{also called}} intimal medial thickness, is a {{measurement of the}} thickness of tunica intima and tunica media, the innermost two layers of the wall of an artery. The measurement is usually made by external ultrasound and occasionally by internal, invasive ultrasound catheters; see <b>Intravascular</b> ultrasound. Measurements of the wall thickness of blood vessels can also be done using other imaging modalities.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} overdose of <b>intravascular</b> injection of local anesthetic {{is characterized by}} hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|Disseminated <b>intravascular</b> {{coagulation}} (DIC) is {{a pathological}} process {{characterized by the}} widespread activation of the clotting cascade that results {{in the formation of}} blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. This leads to compromised tissue blood flow and can ultimately lead to multiple organ damage. In addition, as the coagulation process consumes clotting factors and platelets, normal clotting is disrupted and severe bleeding can occur from various sites.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{products}} such as packed red blood cells, platelets or fresh frozen plasma may also be used. Other regulators of coagulation have also been tried including heparin {{in an effort to}} prevent disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulation and clotting factors to decrease bleeding. Antimalarial medications and antibiotics are often used before the diagnosis is confirmed, though {{there is no evidence to}} suggest such treatment helps. A number of experimental treatments are being studied.|$|E
25|$|Nitrofurantoin is also {{contraindicated}} in babies {{up to the}} age of one month, as {{they have}} immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia. For the same reason, nitrofurantoin should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because of risk of <b>intravascular</b> hemolysis resulting in anemia.|$|E
