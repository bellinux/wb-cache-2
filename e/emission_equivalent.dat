When the CO 2 <b>equivalent</b> <b>emissions</b> are considered, the CO 2 emissions from embodied energy make up an important share of the total, indicating that the building materials have a high importance which is often ignored when only the energy efficiency of running the building is considered. This paper studies a new office building in design phase and offers different alternatives to influence building energy consumption, CO 2 <b>equivalent</b> <b>emissions</b> from embodied energy from building materials and CO 2 <b>equivalent</b> <b>emissions</b> from energy use and how their relationships should be treated. In addition this paper studies how we should weight the primary energy use and the CO 2 <b>equivalent</b> <b>emissions</b> of different design options.
