25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the same as the one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> indeed S.|$|E

All we <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> an echo." [...] Batygin's and Brown's work is similar to how Urbain Le Verrier predicted the position of Neptune based on Alexis Bouvard's observations and theory of Uranus' peculiar motion.|$|E
500|$|Ali Gomaa, the Grand Mufti of Egypt, said: [...] "I greet President Mubarak {{who offered}} {{dialogue}} {{and responded to}} the demands of the people. Going against legitimacy is Haram (forbidden). This is an invitation for chaos. We support stability. What we <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> a blind chaos leading to a civil war. I call on all parents to ask their children to stay home." [...] A former general who was a part of the intelligence services said that Mubarak would have no qualms about [...] "setting the whole country on fire." [...] Western media suggested the possibility of civil war as violence between the two sides escalated, leaving over a thousand injured.|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared in the}} subsequent press conference where Alonso said {{that the decision to}} run a shorter second stint than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his decision: [...] "Sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't but today the car was perfect and I was able to do it." [...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2003, he made {{controversial}} {{comments about}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), saying: [...] "It's about time we started honouring those {{people involved in the}} armed struggle. It was the bombs and bullets and sacrifice made by the likes of Bobby Sands that brought Britain to the negotiating table. The peace we <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> due to the action of the IRA".|$|E

She attributed her getting cancer to her early years in college where she ate junk food before learning about its negative effects on health and a number of x-rays she underwent. Before her death she stated, [...] "In my opinion there is no question whatsoever that the terrific amount of cancer we <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> related to the inadequacies of our American diet." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 10, 1994 Judge Belfi ruled Ferguson was {{competent}} to stand trial. Belfi said he based his decision {{in part on}} his conversations with Ferguson in the courtroom, including Ferguson's concern over Governor Pataki's promise to sign a death-penalty bill. Belfi strongly advised Ferguson against defending himself, but Ferguson said he intended to defend himself. Kuby said of the decision, [...] "What we will <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> a complete circus. A crazy man cannot defend himself. Mr. Ferguson, evidence to the contrary, believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train." [...] Kuby continued, [...] "Without a psychiatric defense, Ferguson has no defense. There was {{no doubt that he}} was there, that he fired the weapon, that he would have fired it more if he had not been wrestled to the ground. There is no doubt that Colin Ferguson, if sane, was guilty." ...|$|E

All Ireland was open to them, on the day when William, with all his forces, sat down here before Limerick. Why, they could have marched straight for Dublin and captured it, before William heard that they had crossed the Shannon. They might have cut off his supplies from Waterford. They might have starved him out in his camp here. They have had the game in their hands, and they have allowed it to slip altogether through their fingers. The only hope I <b>have,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> that before the spring the French will go. It is but too clear that Louis has no intention, whatever, of helping us in earnest.

And he says he doesn't believe all the heathen will be eternally lost. The idea! If they won't all the money we've been giving to Foreign Missions will be clean wasted, that's what! Last Sunday night he announced that next Sunday he'd preach on the axe-head that swam. I think he'd better confine himself to the Bible and leave sensational subjects alone. Things have come to a pretty pass if a minister can't find enough in Holy Writ to preach about, that's what. What church do you attend, Anne? I hope you go regularly. People are apt to get so careless about church-going away from home, and I understand college students are great sinners in this respect. I'm told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday. I hope you'll never sink that low, Anne. Remember how you were brought up. And be very careful what friends you make. You never know what sort of creatures are in them colleges. Outwardly they may be as whited sepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves, that's what. You'd better not have anything to say to any young man who isn't from the Island.|$|E
