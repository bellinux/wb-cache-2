In {{the last ten years}} due to flooding of the Nile many trees were destroyed. Hence it was deemed necessary to grow it in other areas such as Khartoum. In Khartoum the rainfall starts at the middle of July and peaks in the middle of August till end October. Early ripening is a necessity to avoid rotting and fermentation. Use of ethrel (2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid) by two methods was tried at the beginning of June (when the fruits starts to change color) and two weeks later. The first method by making a small pit on the peduncle and injecting into it 2 ml of ethrel (480 g/l) then cover it with cellotape. The other method by spraying by 1000 ppm ethrel. There was significant increase in fruit ripening especially by the first method. However, the ripening did not exceed 70 % in Mishrigi Wadlagi cultivar by mid august. On the other hand, Mishrigi Wad Khatib ripening percentage could exceed 90 % by beginning of August i. e. before the heavy rains starts.

We {{hypothesized}} that Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) use as odor cues those volatile compounds that increase in emission rate as fruit ripens. We examined whether the smell of fermentation products may indicate the degree of ripeness to fruit bats. We analyzed volatile compounds in the headspace (the gas space above a fruit in a closed container) of <b>dates</b> (<b>Phoenix</b> <b>dactylifera)</b> and rusty figs (Ficus rubiginosa), {{both of which are}} consumed by fruit bats, to elucidate which compounds originate from fermentative pathways and to determine which change in emission rate during ripening. Ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were the only volatile compounds detected as products of fermentation in both fruits. In dates, emission rates of these compounds increased during maturation, whereas in rusty figs, they decreased or remained constant. Methanol, although not a fermentation product, increased in emission rate during ripening in both fruits. We found that R. aegyptiacus was neither attracted nor deterred by the smell of methanol at any of the concentrations used. Although the odor of ethanol emanating from food containing concentrations similar to those found in ripe fruit did not attract the bats, at relatively high concentrations (>= 1 %), the smell of ethanol deterred them. Thus, ethanol at high concentrations may serve as a signal for bats to avoid overripe, unpalatable fruit...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEthanol {{production}} from by-products of dates in very high gravity {{was conducted in}} batch fermentation using two yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, {{as well as a}} native strain: an osmophilic strain of bacteria which was isolated for the first time from the juice of <b>dates</b> (<b>Phoenix</b> <b>dactylifera</b> L.). The phylogenetic analysis based on the 16 S ribosomal RNA and gyrB sequence and physiological analysis indicated that the strain identified belongs to the genus of Bacillus, B. amyloliquefaciens. The ethanol yields produced from the syrup of dates (175  g L(- 1) and 360  g L(- 1) of total sugar) were 40. 6 % and 29. 5 %, respectively. By comparing the ethanol production by the isolated bacteria to that obtained using Z. rouxii and S. cerevisiae, it can be concluded that B. amyloliquefaciens was suitable for ethanol {{production from}} the syrup of dates and can consume the three types of sugar (glucose, fructose, and sucrose). Using Z. rouxii, fructose was preferentially consumed, while glucose was consumed only after fructose depletion. From this, B. amyloliquefaciens was promising for the bioethanol industry. In addition, this latter showed a good tolerance for high sugar concentration (36 %), allowing ethanol production in batch fermentation at pH 5. 0 and 28  °C in date syrup medium. Promising ethanol yield produced to sugar consumed were observed for the two osmotolerant microorganisms, Z. rouxii and B. amyloliquefaciens, nearly 32 - 33 %, which were further improved when they were cocultivated, leading to an ethanol to glucose yield of 42 - 43 %...|$|E

Results showed predominance of total sugars and {{a relatively low}} content of protein, fat andash. On the other hand, optimisation of extraction of antioxidant was carried using five different solvents. The highest level of phenolic compounds for all dates varieties {{was found in the}} 70 % acetone extract. This level ranged from 199. 43 to 576. 48 mg of GAE/ 100 g fresh weight. However, extraction into 50 % methanol gave the highest antioxidant activity from 89. 55 to 109. 67 mg equivalents of ascorbic acid/g fresh weight. For both two olvents, Bejo exhibited the highest phenolic content and total antioxidant activity, while Baydh El Hamam presented the owest. A positive linear correlation between total antioxidant activity and phenolic contents was observed (R 2 = 0. 83; R 2 = 74 for acetone/H 2 O and methanol/H 2 O, respectively). The antioxidant activity of acetone/H 2 O and methanol/H 2 O extracts was carried using DPPH radical-scavenging activity and reducing power. These results showed that dates had strongly scavenging activity on DPPH reaching 90. 12 % in methanol/H 2 O from Deglet Nour. Whereas, acetone/H 2 O showed the best reducing power which Bejo was significantly higher than the other varieties.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{bioactive}} compounds from plants {{has always been}} of great interest for scientists {{who are looking for}} new drugs from natural resources as according to WHO survey 80 % of world population still rely on traditional medicines. Keeping this in mind the present research was conducted with a focus on isolation of some bioactive fractions from medicinal plants with strong antibacterial activities against dental caries causing pathogens. Eight plants were {{selected on the basis of}} their traditional uses, literature survey and ethnobotanical importance, Gaff (Diospyros blancoi), Grapes (Vitis vinifera), Jamaun (Syzygium cumuni), Gauva (Psidium guajava), Mango (Mangifera indica), Litchi (Litchi chinensis), <b>Dates</b> (<b>Phoenix</b> <b>dactylifera)</b> and Mulberry (Morus nigra). Extracts of all these plants in different solvents i. e. n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, methanol and water were tested for antibacterial activities against six oral bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Two plants i. e. Jamaun (Syzygium cumuni), Gauva (Psidium guajava)) were selected on the basis of antibacterial activity and preliminary phytochemical analysis. Tablets were formulated form the crude extracts of the selected plants Syzygium cumuni and Psidium guajava and their efficacy was clinically tested. The in-vivo studies revealed the efficacy of dental caries tablets equal to 54 %. Bioassay guided purification of the crude extracts of the two plants were carried out using different chromatotographic techniques (flash, column and thin layer chromatography). Out of 60 fractions obtained as a result of different chromatographic techniques, total of 5 fractions having bioactive compounds were further selected from both the plants. The anti-biofilm assay revealed the biofilm inhibition of almost between 90 - 95 %. The FT-IR analysis revealed the presences of nitrile and aromatic groups in the bioactive fractions owing to the anti-caries activity of the extract. Scanning electron microscopic studies of cells after treatment with active fractions of extracts revealed that the extracts affected the integrity of the cell wall to considerable extent. Hence, it can be safely concluded that the inhibition of the dental caries causing bacteria by crude and partially purified extracts of Psidium guajava and Syzygium cumini was due to presences of various active compounds that act in synergy to cause biological effect which might not be recapitulated using single entities. Different combinations of ethyl acetate extracts of these plants will prove helpful in treating dental caries in a more natural and safe way in this world of searching for discovery of safe drug...|$|E
