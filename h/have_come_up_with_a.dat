5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV {{go so far as to}} offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

25|$|Classically, scrolls of {{the books}} of the Bible have always been divided by blank spaces at the end (petuhoth) or middle (setumoth) of the lines. However, Langton is {{believed}} to be the one who divided the Bible into the standard modern arrangement of chapters. While Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro is also known to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> systematic division of the Bible (between 1244 and 1248), it is Langton's arrangement of the chapters that remains in use today.|$|E
25|$|In the {{principles}} and parameters theory, a head-directionality parameter is proposed {{as a way of}} classifying languages. A language which has head-initial structures {{is considered to be a}} head-initial language, and one which has head-final structures is considered to be a head-final language. It is found, however, that very few, if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other. Linguists <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of theories to explain the inconsistencies, sometimes positing a more consistent underlying order, with the phenomenon of phrasal movement being used to explain the surface deviations.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim.

Josh Wigler of MTV wrote that Fringe [...] "proved once again that it's {{one of the most}} the most innovative, entertaining genre shows currently airing on television," [...] and he couldn't wait for next week's episode.

500|$|Tim Cain, Fallout and Fallout 2 game director, {{praised the}} art {{direction}} {{and the attention}} to details in the game, but didn't {{like the way the}} endings were not enough constructed around player's actions and decisions. He was also critical of how the game recycled plot elements from the first two games such as Super Mutants and Enclave, saying that if his company, Troika Games, had acquired the license, he would <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> completely original story for the East coast. Chris Avellone, Fallout 2 main writer, described the game to have [...] "enough options and tools at my disposal to insure I was having fun no matter what the challenges", praising the immersion in the Fallout's world, the successful to take the legacy of the previous two chapters, and fulfilling open-world component; while he criticized the writing of some characters and some of gameplay's choices in balancing the skills of player character. Will Tuttle of GameSpy commended the game for its [...] "engaging storyline, impeccable presentation, and hundreds of hours of addictive gameplay". Although Edge awarded the game 7 out of 10, in a later anniversary issue it placed the game 37th in a [...] "100 best games to play today" [...] list, saying [...] "Fallout 3 empowers, engages and rewards to extents that few games have ever achieved".|$|E
2500|$|At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Valdemar Poulsen had {{presented}} {{a paper on}} an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady [...] "continuous wave" [...] signals {{that could be used}} for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. Although Poulsen had patented his invention, de Forest claimed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variation that allowed him to avoid infringing on Poulsen's work. Using his [...] "sparkless" [...] arc transmitter, de Forest first transmitted audio across a lab room on December 31, 1906, and by February was making experimental transmissions, including music produced by Thaddeus Cahill's telharmonium, that were heard throughout the city.|$|E

2500|$|Historian {{and full}} {{professor}} of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined {{that the move}} to ban the Gita was [...] "contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, [...] "one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts {{as to whether the}} local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the Bhagavad Gita Volodin replied that [...] "all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the main}} characters, however, German society in the early 1960s is {{becoming}} more and more rebellious. The young generation have no memory of the instability that paved the way for Hitler's rise to power. Student protests, particularly against the war in the Urals, American and British cultural influence, and growing pacifism are all found in Nazi society. Jazz music is still popular and the German government claims to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> version which is free from [...] "Negroid influence". In spite of the general repressiveness, the Beatles' real-life Hamburg engagements have happened here as well (and have already been denounced in the state-run press). Germany is under constant attack by terrorist groups, with officials assassinated and civilian airliners bombed in-flight. Christianity is suppressed, and Nazi youth organisations are compulsory for all children. Universities are centres of student dissent, and the White Rose movement is once again active.|$|E
2500|$|Fowler and {{coworkers}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scheme that mobilizes the 1-aza-Cope rearrangement as a synthetically useful route. [...] Fowler {{and coworkers}} recognized {{that because the}} barrier for the reaction lies in the nitrogen’s thermodynamic preference to stay as an imine, stabilizing the nitrogen could have a thermodynamically beneficial effect. [...] To that end, Fowler and coworkers installed a carbonyl group on the nitrogen, hypothesizing that the lone pair of the nitrogen would be stabilized by participation in an amide bond, and that the electronegativity of this amide group would lower the LUMO of the imine group, making the transition state more favorable. [...] Using this strategy, Fowler and coworkers {{were able to use}} the 1-aza-Cope rearrangement to create piperidine and pyridine derivatives. [...] This strategy was shown to be relatively robust, allowing for the formation of products even when forced through a boat transition state, when perturbed with substituent effects, or put in competition with alternative rearrangements. [...] Also significant is the relative ease of production of the reactants, which uses a Diels-Alder reaction paired with relatively simple workup steps, allowing for syntheses using complex cycling.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson is {{considered}} {{a master of the}} blues, particularly of the Delta blues style. Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, said in 1990, [...] "You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it." [...] But according to Elijah Wald, in his book Escaping the Delta, Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play {{in a wide range of}} styles, from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks, and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song. His first recorded song, [...] "Kind Hearted Woman Blues," [...] in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of Chicago or St. Louis, with [...] "a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement." [...] Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. [...] "They're Red Hot", from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an [...] "uptown" [...] swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the Harlem Hamfats, but as Wald remarked, [...] "no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home Ink Spots ... e could undoubtedly <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them."

2500|$|Other critics {{expressed}} {{more negative}} {{opinions of the}} game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay. Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it. Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes. Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed. Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go {{was not a good}} game, it was [...] "a great experience". The server problems also received negative press. Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game's strong social appeal and visual design, the game's [...] "initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems. Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the [...] "three-step glitch", reviewers also gave this bug negative press. Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, [...] "the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go". Paul Tassi (Forbes) said that due to this bug it's [...] "anyone's best guess where Pokémon are 99% of the time" [...] and that it [...] "renders almost all traditional methods of tracking pointless". Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players. Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms. However, the developers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solution on solving the problems rural players face daily.|$|E
