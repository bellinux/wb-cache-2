The foundation's major events have included the Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic.

500|$|Boyack {{said that}} as leader, she would {{campaign}} on better funding for healthcare, improvements to childcare, <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth</b> employment opportunities, and the devolvement of power to local government. She backed the scrapping of the Trident programme. She wanted to reform Council tax, which had been frozen since the SNP {{came to power in}} 2007, and suggested the existing eight tax bands should be redrawn. She would allow local authorities to raise a tourism tax, while environmentally friendly power firms and bus companies would be created to raise public funds. She supported establishing a consensus on whether or not to have full tax devolution, but had [...] "reservations" [...] about the prospect of devolving further taxes to Holyrood. She favoured devolving welfare benefits to Scotland. She told STV's Stephen Daisley that she wished [...] "to make Scottish Labour a force in Scottish politics again". After publishing a list of social justice-themed policies, she announced plans to establish a commission similar to the Social Justice Commission created by UK Labour leader John Smith in 1994, which had helped shape Labour policy in areas such as employment and welfare.|$|E
500|$|Many of Strom's policy {{initiatives}} revolved around <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>youth.</b> [...] He created the Alberta Service Corps, which allowed young Albertans to work summers on public services and environmental projects for remuneration, {{and which was}} one of several models for the federal government's later Katimavik program. [...] In response to increasing use of illicit drugs by Alberta youth, his government, led by Education Minister Bob Clark, inserted anti-narcotics messages into the province's school curriculum. [...] Strom implemented trial kindergarten programs in Edmonton and Calgary—the Calgary program, provided jointly by an inner-city community association and the Mount Royal College, has been called one of Canada's first public-private partnerships. [...] His interest in educational matters was perhaps best exemplified by his government's Commission on Educational Planning, which travelled the province to solicit Albertans' views and whose final report, A Choice of Futures, was credited by Barr as setting [...] "the tone and direction for education in Alberta for the next generation". [...] The Strom government also made substantial reforms to Alberta's post-secondary education system, expanding distance learning through the creation of Athabasca University and laying the foundation's for ACCESS television, and effectively creating the province's College (as distinct from University) system. [...] This latter move {{led to the creation of}} Grant MacEwan College.|$|E
