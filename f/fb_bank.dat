40|$|Purpose: The {{contribution}} {{of this research}} is to propose a new problem of linear-mixed programming model (LMPM) for the allocation-packing of multiple pantries personalized for Food <b>Banks</b> (<b>FB)</b> considering the opinion of the Decision Maker (DM) in the selection of the best solution. Design/methodology/approach: A food allocation-packing system is modeled as a mixed integer problem (MIP) and a fuzzy mixed integer linear problem (FMILP).   250 families and 100 products were considered. The solutions were found using Lingo 13 ® (for both deterministic and fuzzy model). To select a good solution in the fuzzy model, this research adapted an interactive method proposed in the literature. The relevance of this modification is that the opinion of a decision maker (DM) is included and considered. Findings: The results for the deterministic and fuzzy model are compared in terms of their accomplishment of the restrictions (mainly nutritional and logistic) and the time needed to achieve a solution.   Research limitations/implications: This paper was done considering quantity, weight and volume restrictions so that in theory, the pantry will be able to contain different products; it is not considered how the products will be stored into the pantry. Practical implications: This research proposes an alternative food management system at a food bank. The proposed system organizes the content of customized food pantries by the bias of a food allocation model. Social implications: Our paper analyzes a Food <b>Bank</b> (<b>FB)</b> in México. With this proposal, food will be distributed to families in poverty considering their particular nutritional needs. Originality/value: The main {{contribution of}} this article lies in the proposal of a new model of mixed integer linear problem (MILP)   for the allocationpacking of food, solved with fuzzy posibilistic programming that simultaneously considers nutritional and logistic restrictions applied to a type of organization that has been little studied in the literature and where the opinion of Decision Maker (DM) is very important in the operational decisions involved in the Food Supply Chain (FSC) of a Food <b>Bank</b> (<b>FB)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an alternative approach}} for viewing a real orthogonal space time block code (ROSTBC) in frequency selective channel as a filter <b>bank</b> (<b>FB).</b> A communications system with multiple transmitting antennas and a single receiving antenna is considered. From the FB point of view, this system when employing a rate- 1 ROSTBC, can {{be treated as a}} maximally decimated FB. Likewise, it becomes a non-maximally decimated FB, when a non-rate 1 ROSTBC is employed. The amount of redundancy can be observed from the number of channels between the analysis and the synthesis polyphase matrices versus the number of input channels. When there is redundancy, the block MIMO channel (describing the overall physical channels between the transmitter and receiver) becomes a tall matrix. Hence an FIR inverse (synthesis matrix) is more likely to exist at the receiver side. On the other hand, for all full rate ROSTBCs, the channel matrix becomes a square matrix. Its Smith form always consists of a nontrivial FIR term, prohibiting the existence of its FIR inverse. Simulations and examples are given to illustrate various concepts developed in this paper.
