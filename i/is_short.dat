5|$|The skull, which <b>is</b> <b>short</b> at the front, {{shows some}} typical oryzomyine characters. The palate is long, {{extending}} past the molars and the maxillary bones. The alisphenoid strut, {{which in some}} sigmodontines separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, is absent. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process contacting the tegmen tympani, the roof the tympanic cavity. The front part <b>is</b> <b>short.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined above) <b>is</b> <b>short</b> {{compared to}} the physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are more important than those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E

Some telescoped forms can <b>be</b> <b>shorter</b> than the original classical compounds: gynie <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than gyneco- and stands for both gynecology and gynecologist; anthro <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than anthropo- and stands for anthropology.|$|R
5|$|Chapter 3 <b>is</b> <b>short,</b> {{and opens}} {{with a list of}} eight asanas (postures), {{followed}} by the description of each one. The asanas are of two types: one set is for meditative contemplation, and the other for cleansing the body. Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.3–5 and 3.13–14 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas.|$|E
5|$|David C. Parker in 2004 {{argued that}} {{manuscript}} was written later the 6th century, {{because it has}} a small number of square letters, and the handwriting is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed (Μ, Δ, Ε), the bar over the letter Τ <b>is</b> <b>short</b> and the letter Υ is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century.|$|E

He is a frequent guest on the radio talkshow Loveline, hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky.|$|E

30|$|The {{amplitude}} of the PI is larger when the rise time <b>is</b> <b>shorter.</b> This <b>is</b> {{consistent with the}} relationship between the rise time and {{amplitude of}} the DL, and the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL because the effective length of the PI, i.e., the dynamo region, <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL. Also, the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> at an enhanced speed than at an enhanced density. It is therefore suggested that a high-speed solar wind is needed to create a rapid magnetic variation.|$|R
5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle <b>is</b> <b>short</b> enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
5|$|The Garden of Words <b>is</b> <b>short,</b> lasting {{approximately}} 46minutes in length, a trend {{also seen}} among Shinkai's earlier works. Although he had stated {{in an interview}} with Anime News Network that he does like making shorter films, Shinkai noted that he did not originally plan for the film to be played in theaters. Instead, he intended for people to casually view the film on tablets, computers, and in home theaters. A target length was never specified from the outset, instead the relationship between Takao and Yukari was emphasized, although it was known from early in the production that the film would be short.|$|E

5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance <b>is</b> <b>short</b> and power demand is low.|$|E

The supporters were: dexter a unicorn of Scotland imperially crowned, supporting a tilting lance flying a banner Azure a saltire Argent (Cross of Saint Andrew) and sinister the crowned lion of England supporting a similar lance flying a banner Argent a cross Gules (Cross of Saint George). The Scottish crest and motto was retained, following the Scottish practice the motto In defens (which <b>is</b> <b>short</b> for In My Defens God Me Defend) was placed above the crest.|$|E
5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid <b>is</b> <b>short</b> $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E

5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat <b>is</b> <b>short</b> and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress.

The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The only {{overlapping}} material between BMNH R3078 and the holotype of Cetiosauriscus leedsi is an ilium. However, in both specimens the ilium was {{preserved in}} insufficient ways. Since the only overlapping material {{was impossible to}} compare, Charig found that BMNH R3078 was of a different species and he named it Cetiosauriscus stewarti. Metacarpal 1 <b>is</b> <b>short</b> and massive, with the prominent process on {{the lower part of}} the posterior margin of the lateral face, a characteristic of the diplodocoids Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Dicraeosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The poly(A) tail is {{important}} for the nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it <b>is</b> <b>short</b> enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.|$|E
