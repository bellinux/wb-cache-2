The Martian sets off and lands in the United States. He ventures into a nearby city and becomes awestruck when he sees average citizens with [...] "powerful and reliable automobiles" [...] that make their daily lives easier. The Martian then enters a library and researches the [...] "secrets" [...] the remarkable power source. The Martian triumphantly returns to Mars with stolen library books on the oil industry.

50|$|Sons of Lioth {{was founded}} in 2005 by guitarists Sublimo and Supremo. The band {{released}} a 5-song demo in 2006 titled <b>Destination</b> <b>Earth.</b> At first, it knew an awesome response and saw a good review in Mindview. In 2009, they released a full album called Legends. The tracks Spartacus and Last Unicorn were included, {{as well as a}} live version of Raise your fist and a bonus track Wrecking ball. The band split up shortly thereafter in 2010 due to unknown reasons. Unable to promote their new album, it was tucked away for a select audience. Recently, in 2013 they released a new EP named Large hadron collider spider featuring an artwork cover and five metal-tracks, including a title song. The EP got a good review on metalstorm and one from infernal masquerade, saying 'this EP is by far better than most of the mainstream Heavy Metal that was produced in the last 10 years'.|$|E
5000|$|The colony's {{officials}} give vague explanations to {{the reason}} on why [...] "Helios" [...] has been diverted {{to land on}} the Moon instead of on its original <b>destination,</b> <b>Earth.</b> Initially it is only said that it is [...] "not feasible", or [...] "pointless" [...] to go to Earth now. Gradually [...] "Helios"' crew find out that the Earth's population underwent some process of degeneration (the cause, however, not being revealed), that the Earth's inhabitants are expected to die out quickly, and that the Moon colonies were constructed as a sort of asylum for the non-degenerated part of humanity, which is also expected to recolonize Earth when the crisis will have ended. The crew, however, can already see that the Moon's inhabitants are undergoing some degeneration process as well (skeletal, due to lighter gravity on the Moon, but also mental due to living permanently underground, which leads to chronic agoraphobia) and this finding in turn casts doubts on the planned recolonization. Also, they find out that even the regime itself does not know about the current situation on the Earth, because any bilateral communication was cut long time ago.|$|E

50|$|For low Earth orbit, Delta II is not {{equipped}} with a third stage. Payloads bound for higher energy orbits such as GTO or to reach Earth escape velocity for trans-Mars injection or other <b>destinations</b> beyond <b>Earth</b> use a solid propellant third stage. This stage is spin-stabilized and depends on the second stage for proper orientation prior to stage separation, but was sometimes {{equipped with a}} nutation control system to maintain proper spin axis. It also included a yo-weight system to induce tumbling in the third stage after payload separation to prevent recontact, or a yo-yo de-spin mechanism to slow the rotation before payload release.|$|R

The Aliens escape their enclosures, while Ripley and the mercenaries attempt to escape and destroy the Auriga before it reaches its <b>destination,</b> <b>Earth.</b> Ripley is taken to the Alien nest, where the Queen gives birth to a Newborn, a Xenomorph with human traits. The hybrid Alien recognizes Ripley as its mother and kills the queen Alien. Ripley finds her way onto the ship and manages to push the Newborn through a hole due to decompression. The survivors escape with another ship, [...] "The Betty". The Auriga collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. Call and Ripley look down at Earth, and when Call asks what Ripley wants to do next, she says, [...] "I'm a stranger here myself."

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to apply the formula given above to calculate the Δv in km/s needed to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit to arrive at various <b>destinations</b> from <b>Earth</b> (assuming circular orbits for the planets). In this table, the column labeled [...] "Δv to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit" [...] gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed {{to get on a}} Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the sun. The column labeled [...] "v exiting LEO" [...] gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centered on the earth) when 300 km above the Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73 km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column [...] "Δv from LEO" [...] is simply the previous speed minus 7.73 km/s.|$|R

[...] <b>Destinations</b> beyond low <b>Earth</b> orbit that were considered by the Committee include the Moon, Mars, and near-Earth objects {{as well as the}} moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos.

40|$|Long {{duration}} human missions beyond low Earth orbit, such as {{a permanent}} lunar base, an asteroid rendezvous, or exploring Mars, will use recycling life support systems to preclude supplying large amounts of metabolic consumables. The International Space Station (ISS) life support design provides a historic guiding basis for future systems, but both its system architecture and the subsystem technologies should be reconsidered. Different technologies for the functional subsystems have been investigated and some past alternates appear better for flexible path <b>destinations</b> beyond low <b>Earth</b> orbit. There {{is a need to}} develop more capable technologies that provide lower mass, increased closure, and higher reliability.
