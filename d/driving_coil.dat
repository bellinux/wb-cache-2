50|$|Industrial {{conductivity}} probes often employ an inductive method, {{which has}} the advantage that the fluid does not wet the electrical parts of the sensor. Here, two inductively-coupled coils are used. One is the <b>driving</b> <b>coil</b> producing a magnetic field and it is supplied with accurately-known voltage.

50|$|The cooking vessel {{typically}} {{needs to}} be made of a suitable stainless steel or iron. The increased magnetic permeability of the material decreases the skin depth, concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from litz wire, which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a transformer that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the <b>driving</b> <b>coil</b> stays cool.|$|E

50|$|The WiTricity type {{magnetic}} resonance is characterized {{in that the}} resonant coils on the primary side and the resonant coils on the secondary side are paired. The primary resonator increases the primary <b>driving</b> <b>coil</b> current and increases the generated magnetic flux around the primary resonator. This is equivalent to driving the primary coil at high voltage. In {{the case of the}} type on the left figure, the general principle is that if a given oscillating amount of energy (for example a pulse or a series of pulses) is placed into a primary coil which is capacitively loaded, the coil will 'ring', and form an oscillating magnetic field. The energy will transfer {{back and forth between the}} magnetic field in the inductor and the electric field across the capacitor at the resonant frequency. This oscillation will die away at a rate determined by the gain-bandwidth (Q factor), mainly due to resistive and radiative losses. However, provided the secondary coil cuts enough of the field that it absorbs more energy than is lost in each cycle of the primary, then most of the energy can still be transferred.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{induction}} tomography (MIT) is a tomographic {{imaging technique}} that {{is able to}} map the electromagnetic properties within an object or vessel from magnetic field measurements. Excitation coils are used to induce eddy currents in the medium, and the magnetic field produced by the induced eddy current is then sensed by receiver coils. Because of its noncontact nature, MIT is particularly attractive for biomedical and some industrial applications, such as pipe-flow monitoring, when compared with traditional contact electrode-based electrical impedance tomography. This paper describes the design and performance of an MIT transceiver circuit that can operate from 400 kHz to 12 MHz.

We used two kinds of HTS wire for the coil. The impedance of the coil was negligible in normal operation.

Magnetic probes mounted inside the vacuum chamber are widely used to characterize the mode structure of magnetohydrodynamic modes, as, due to their relative simplicity and compact nature, several coils can be distributed over the vessel.

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic field {{measurement}} {{has many}} applications {{particularly in the}} field of navigation, military, space exploration, and medical. Among many magnetic devices, magnetometer is significant due to its capability of detecting direction and measuring strength of magnetic field. Through the years, many types of magnetometer had been invented with fluxgate magnetometer being one of the most well-known. In the advances of MEMS processing technology, fluxgate magnetometer is increasingly developed into micro-scale. Fluxgate magnetometer is made up of three major components consisting of sensing coil, <b>driving</b> <b>coil</b> and magnetic core. The physical characteristics of the coil structure play an important factor in miniaturization as well as in performance of the device. Therefore, investigations on the physical characteristics of the coils are relevant.

40|$|Pulsed {{inductive}} plasma thrusters [1 - 3] are spacecraft propulsion {{devices in}} which electrical energy is capacitively stored and then discharged through an inductive coil. The thruster is electrodeless, with a time-varying current in the coil interacting with a plasma covering {{the face of}} the coil to induce a plasma current. Propellant is accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity (O(10 - 100 km/s)) by the Lorentz body force arising from the interaction of the magnetic field and the induced plasma current. While this class of thruster mitigates the life-limiting issues associated with electrode erosion, pulsed inductive plasma thrusters can su er from both high pulse energy requirements imposed by the voltage demands of inductive propellant ionization, and low propellant utilization efficiencies. The Microwave Assisted Discharge Inductive Plasma Accelerator (MAD-IPA) [4], shown in Fig. 1 is a pulsed inductive plasma thruster that is able to operate at lower pulse energies by partially ionizing propellant with an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) discharge inside a conical inductive coil whose geometry serves to potentially increase propellant and plasma plume containment relative to at coil geometries.

40|$|A {{model of}} the maximum {{achievable}} exhaust velocity of a conical theta pinch pulsed inductive thruster is presented. A semi-empirical formula relating coil inductance to both axial and radial current sheet location is developed and incorporated into a circuit model coupled to a momentum equation to evaluate the effect of coil geometry on the axial directed kinetic energy of the exhaust. Inductance measurements {{as a function of}} the axial and radial displacement of simulated current sheets from four coils of different geometries are t to a two-dimensional expression to allow the calculation of the Lorentz force at any relevant averaged current sheet location. This relation for two-dimensional inductance, along with an estimate of the maximum possible change in gas-dynamic pressure as the current sheet accelerates into downstream propellant, enables the expansion of a one-dimensional circuit model to two dimensions. The results of this two-dimensional model indicate that radial current sheet motion acts to rapidly decouple the current sheet from the <b>driving</b> <b>coil,</b> leading to losses in axial kinetic energy 10 - 50 times larger than estimations of the maximum available energy in the compressed propellant. The decreased available energy in the compressed propellant as compared to that of other inductive plasma propulsion concepts suggests that a recovery in the directed axial kinetic energy of the exhaust is unlikely, and that radial compression of the current sheet leads to a loss in exhaust velocity for the operating conditions considered here...|$|E

Instead of directly <b>driving</b> the <b>coil</b> with a high voltage, a series resonant circuit may be used to provide the high voltage. A series capacitor is added in series with the coils. The capacitance is chosen to resonate the coil at the desired frequency. Only the coils parasitic resistance is remained.

40|$|AbstractAn {{attempt was}} made to tune the Coler {{magnetic}} current apparatus with the magneto acoustic resonance of the magnetic rods. Measurements with a replica of the famous Coler “Magnetstromapparat” were conducted. In order to tune the acoustic, magnetic and electric resonance circuits of the Coler device the magneto-acoustic resonance was measured with a frequency scan through a function generator and a lock-in amplifier. The frequency generator was powering a <b>driving</b> <b>coil,</b> while the lock-in was connected to a pickup coil. Both coils were placed on a magnetic rod. Resonances were observed up to the 17 th harmonic. The quality Q of the observed resonances was 270. To study the magneto-acoustic resonance in the time domain a pair of Permendur rods were employed. The magneto-acoustic resonances of the Permendur rods were observed with an oscilloscope. Spectra of the magneto acoustic resonance were measured for the Permendur rods and for a Coler replica magnet in the frequency range from 25 kHz to 380 kHz. The next step was to bring the resonances of the Permendur rods close together so that they overlap. The 10 thharmonic was chosen because it was close to the 180 kHz that Hans Coler related to ferromagnetism. Further more magneto-acoustic coupling between the Permendur rods was studied. Finally the question was explored if Hans Coler converted vacuum fluctuations via magnetic and acoustic resonance into electricity. There is a strong connection between magnetism and quantum field zero point energy (ZPE).

40|$|Using self-sensing in an {{electrodynamic}} actuator for broadband active vibration damping requires compensation of the actuator resistance {{and of the}} self-inductance of the actuator with an appropriate shunted circuit. In order to reduce power consumption the actuator resistance should be small, but for robustness of self-sensing and a large bandwidth a large resistance is required. A high transducer coefficient is important to get high sensitivity of the induced voltage that {{is proportional to the}} vibration velocity of an attached mechanical structure. However, a large transducer coefficient implies a strong magnetic field that also increases the self-inductance so that the measurement bandwidth potentially is reduced. In this study, in order to eliminate the first trade-off between power consumption and robustness, an actuator with a primary <b>driving</b> <b>coil</b> and a secondary measurement coil is proposed. The primary coil is optimized for driving by choosing a small resistance, whereas the secondary coil is optimized for sensing by choosing a large resistance. It has been shown that the transformer coupling between the two coils could be reduced by decreasing the cross section of the secondary coil, but there is a geometric limit on the reduction of the cross section of the secondary coil. Therefore an analogue electronic compensation scheme is proposed to compensate for the transformer coupling between the primary and the secondary coil. Feedback of the sensed velocity in the secondary coil is implemented and experimental vibration damping results at a plate are presented. Results are compared to self-sensing vibration damping, active vibration damping using a velocity sensor and passive damping means of the same weight as the actuator...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{solid-state}} devices {{made their}} way {{in the development of}} electromagnetic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) probes. This fact was evidenced especially for pulsed eddy current, where magneto-resistive and Hall effect devices are used as sensing elements. Their low frequency range and small surface area are suitable to improve the detection of buried and small discontinuities. Although their properties are expected to enhance detectability over simple induction coils, this was still to be proven or demonstrated in a comparative study. This work compares the sensing capabilities of an induction coil to those of two solid-state devices: giant-magneto-resistive (GMR) and Hall effect sensors. All of them are used as detectors in pulsed eddy current probes that have the same excitation mechanism, a ring-type copper coil driven by a constant amplitude square waveform. While the excitation part of the probe is fixed, the sensing components are inter-changeable. Although both induction coils and solid-state sensors output a voltage value as an indication of the magnetic field they are detecting, the voltage for pick-up coils is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. For solid-state sensors the output is in direct relation to the detected magnetic field. Under this study, all three sensing elements are used to detect the driving coil's magnetic output (magnetic field or flux) in air, on planes perpendicular and parallel to the face of the driver coil. The results obtained by all three sensors are quantitatively compared.
