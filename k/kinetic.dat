5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with <b>kinetic</b> friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the <b>kinetic</b> friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when <b>kinetic</b> friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its <b>kinetic</b> energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its <b>kinetic</b> energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or <b>kinetic</b> energy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kinetic</b> models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A <b>kinetic</b> description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to <b>kinetic</b> description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes <b>kinetic</b> information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. <b>Kinetic</b> models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Abnormally bright Type Ia supernovae are {{expected}} {{when the white}} dwarf already has a mass higher than the Chandrasekhar limit, possibly enhanced further by asymmetry, but the ejected material will have less than normal <b>kinetic</b> energy.|$|E
5|$|Explosives {{would also}} have been superfluous. At its closing {{velocity}} of 10.2km/s, the impactor's <b>kinetic</b> energy was equivalent to 4.8 metric tons of TNT, considerably more than its actual mass of only 370kg.|$|E
5|$|In {{magnetized}} plasmas, a gyrokinetic {{approach can}} substantially reduce the computational {{expense of a}} fully <b>kinetic</b> simulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kinetic</b> {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the <b>kinetic</b> effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary <b>kinetic</b> isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of}} an {{expanding}} supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby, dense molecular clouds in space. The increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud {{is unable to}} lose the excess energy.|$|E

5|$|This {{changed in}} 1859 when James Clerk Maxwell contributed {{significantly}} to the field, more specifically, to the <b>kinetic</b> theory of gases, by presenting work where he assumed the gas particles move in random directions at random velocities. The <b>kinetic</b> theory of gases and statistical physics continued to be developed {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, with work done chiefly by Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Gibbs, which would later have an influence on Albert Einstein's model for Brownian movement.|$|E
25|$|Thus the <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of}} a tennis ball in flight is the <b>kinetic</b> energy due to its rotation, plus the <b>kinetic</b> energy due to its translation.|$|E
25|$|This is {{employed}} in calculating of <b>kinetic</b> boundary layer problems of linear <b>kinetic</b> equations.|$|E
25|$|The total <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of}} a system depends on the {{inertial}} frame of reference: it {{is the sum of}} the total <b>kinetic</b> energy in a center of momentum frame and the <b>kinetic</b> energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the center of mass.|$|E
25|$|HK was {{contracted}} by the United States Army {{to produce}} the <b>kinetic</b> energy subsystem (see: <b>kinetic</b> projectiles or <b>kinetic</b> energy penetrator) of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon, a planned replacement for the M16/M203 grenade launcher combination. The OICW was designed to fire 5.56mm bullets and 25mm grenades. The <b>kinetic</b> energy component was also developed separately as the XM8, though both the OICW and XM8 are now indefinitely suspended.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>kinetic</b> {{energy is}} {{quadratic}} in {{the components of}} the velocity, by equipartition these three components each contribute kBT to the average <b>kinetic</b> energy in thermal equilibrium. Thus the average <b>kinetic</b> energy of the particle is (3/2)kBT, as in the example of noble gases above.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinetic</b> energy can {{be passed}} from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player imposes <b>kinetic</b> energy on the cue ball by {{striking}} it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically and the ball it collided with accelerates to a speed as the <b>kinetic</b> energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which <b>kinetic</b> energy is preserved. In inelastic collisions, <b>kinetic</b> energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures).|$|E
25|$|The Wegscheider {{conditions}} {{demonstrate that}} whereas {{the principle of}} detailed balance states a local property of equilibrium, it implies {{the relations between the}} <b>kinetic</b> constants that are valid for all states far from equilibrium. This is possible because a <b>kinetic</b> law is known and relations between the rates of the elementary processes at equilibrium can be transformed into relations between <b>kinetic</b> constants which are used globally. For the Wegscheider conditions this <b>kinetic</b> law is the law of mass action (or the generalized law of mass action).|$|E
25|$|For {{extended}} objects {{composed of}} many particles, the <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of the}} composite body {{is the sum of}} the <b>kinetic</b> energies of the particles.|$|E
25|$|The {{microscopic}} <b>kinetic</b> energy {{portion of}} the internal energy {{gives rise to the}} temperature of the system. Statistical mechanics relates the pseudo-random <b>kinetic</b> energy of individual particles to the mean <b>kinetic</b> energy of the entire ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic <b>kinetic</b> energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy {{is often referred to as}} the thermal energy of a system, relating this energy, like the temperature, to the human experience of hot and cold.|$|E
25|$|The speed, {{and thus}} the <b>kinetic</b> energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by {{choosing}} a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has <b>kinetic</b> energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary {{from the point of}} view of an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero <b>kinetic</b> energy. By contrast, the total <b>kinetic</b> energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case the total <b>kinetic</b> energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum <b>kinetic</b> energy contributes to the system's invariant mass, which is independent of the reference frame.|$|E
25|$|The Fermi {{energy is}} an energy {{difference}} (usually corresponding to a <b>kinetic</b> energy), whereas the Fermi level {{is a total}} energy level including <b>kinetic</b> energy and potential energy.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{occurs in}} many forms, {{including}} chemical energy, thermal energy, electromagnetic radiation, gravitational energy, electric energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, and rest energy. These {{can be categorized}} in two main classes: potential energy and <b>kinetic</b> energy. <b>Kinetic</b> energy is the movement energy of an object. <b>Kinetic</b> energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.|$|E
25|$|The average <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of}} the gas {{particles}} depends only on the absolute temperature of the system. The <b>kinetic</b> theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.|$|E
25|$|A <b>kinetic</b> assay, {{in which}} {{measurements}} are performed multiple times over a fixed time interval. <b>Kinetic</b> assay {{results may be}} visualized numerically (for example, as a slope representing the rate of signal change over time), or graphically (for example, as a plot of the signal measured at each time point). For <b>kinetic</b> assays, both the magnitude {{and shape of the}} measured response over time provide important information.|$|E
25|$|A {{system of}} bodies may have {{internal}} <b>kinetic</b> energy {{due to the}} relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the Solar System the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The <b>kinetic</b> energy {{of the system is}} the sum of the <b>kinetic</b> energies of the bodies it contains.|$|E
25|$|John Herapath later {{independently}} formulated a <b>kinetic</b> {{theory in}} 1820, but mistakenly associated temperature with momentum rather than vis viva or <b>kinetic</b> energy. His work ultimately failed peer review and was neglected. John James Waterston in 1843 provided a largely accurate account, again independently, but his work {{received the same}} reception, failing peer review even from someone as well-disposed to the <b>kinetic</b> principle as Davy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinetic</b> theory {{provides}} {{insight into}} the macroscopic properties of gases by considering their molecular composition and motion. Starting with the definitions of momentum and <b>kinetic</b> energy, one can use the conservation of momentum and geometric relationships of a cube to relate macroscopic system properties of temperature and pressure to the microscopic property of <b>kinetic</b> energy per molecule. The theory provides averaged values for these two properties.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spring}} is {{stretched}} or compressed, <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of the}} mass gets converted into potential energy of the spring. By conservation of energy, assuming the datum is defined at the equilibrium position, when the spring reaches its maximum potential energy, the <b>kinetic</b> energy of the mass is zero. When the spring is released, it tries to return to equilibrium, and all its potential energy converts to <b>kinetic</b> energy of the mass.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{credited}} for {{securing the}} trolley for <b>Kinetic,</b> Zara faced {{criticism in the}} boardroom for being the only person on either team who failed to sell anything. She would have most likely been fired had <b>Kinetic</b> lost.|$|E
25|$|In an inelastic collision, {{some of the}} <b>kinetic</b> {{energy of}} the colliding bodies is {{converted}} into other forms of energy (such as heat or sound). Examples include traffic collisions, in which the effect of lost <b>kinetic</b> energy {{can be seen in}} the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms (as in the Franck–Hertz experiment); and particle accelerators in which the <b>kinetic</b> energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>kinetic</b> theory, heat is {{explained}} in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. The immediate meaning of the <b>kinetic</b> energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy. In microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a transport theory, not as steadily localized <b>kinetic</b> energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic <b>kinetic</b> and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions. An early and vague expression of this was made by Francis Bacon. Precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two factors}} that can change the {{temperature}} of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in internal energy or the conversion between potential and <b>kinetic</b> internal energy. Temperature is the measure of thermal <b>kinetic</b> energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal <b>kinetic</b> energy. The internal energy {{is the sum of}} thermal <b>kinetic</b> energy and thermal potential energy. Thus, even if the internal energy does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between <b>kinetic</b> and potential energy; this is what happens in a free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands. If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total internal energy changes. This is what happens in a Joule–Thomson expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.|$|E
