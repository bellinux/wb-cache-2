25|$|The {{main source}} of {{problems}} was confusion between <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>number</b> encoding and binary-coded decimal encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0–9 as 0x0–0x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.|$|E

40|$|Engineers, {{computer}} scientists, mathematicians {{and others}} must often deal with lengthy <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>numbers.</b> As memory requirements for software increase, the associated memory address space for systems necessitates {{the use of}} longer and longer strings of hexadecimal characters to describe a given number.

This technical memorandum proposes a simple grouping scheme for more clearly representing lengthy <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>numbers</b> in written material, as well as a "code" for naming and more quickly verbalizing such numbers.
