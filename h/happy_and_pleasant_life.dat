50|$|The Estonian Hound is <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> {{dog with}} a balanced, calm and active {{temperament}} and a high intelligence. It is friendly and should never be aggressive, so {{it needs to be}} socialized and exposed to new situations and environments in order to prevent it from being a bit timid. It is good with other dogs and usually also with cats if used to them as a puppy. They love human attention and can get upset when left alone. Proper human to canine communication is really important to its training. They are affectionate and easy to teach; this is important since they have to learn that they cannot hunt hoofed animals as it is forbidden in Estonia where only hare and foxes are allowed to be hunted. The Estonian Hound has a pleasant voice that doesn’t annoy when it hunts.|$|R

5000|$|A young {{orphaned}} {{man in a}} {{small town}} (possibly modeled after the Statlers' hometown of Staunton, Virginia) has for some reason become shunned by the [...] "polite" [...] members of society, and is forced to beg in the streets. His life improves when a streetwalker named Rose, nearly twice his age, takes him in; he becomes her lover. The song juxtaposes the hypocrisy of the nominally Christian townspeople who would [...] "go to church and leave me in the street" [...] and their envy of Rose who [...] "managed a late evening business / like most of the town wished they could do", with the care and tender love that evolves between the two outcasts. The song is both a challenge of narrowminded religion and moralism, and a gentle celebration of love, in some ways not unlike the theme of Luke 7:36-50. The title of [...] "Bed of Rose's" [...] is, like some of the other Statler Brothers' works, a play on words - in this case on the common English idiom [...] "bed of roses", which means an easy <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R

Customers are the vital key for each business and company to help them to grow. So, implementing CRM applications {{is one of the}} important tools that will help managers and companies to increase the satisfaction and loyalty of customers more than before. Beside this, there are some benefits which will affect on customers after implementing CRM. These benefits will help the customers to become <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> of using the companies that is offering their product and services from using CRM facilities. In this study, we find eight benefits of CRM which are important and beneficial for customers such as improve customer services, increased personalized service, responsive to customer’s needs, customer segmentation, improve customization of marketing, multichannel integration, time saving, and improve customer knowledge. We reviewed previous studies, and identify these benefits which will affect on customers. Our result will help the managers and companies to know and recognize the factors and benefits of CRM which are more significant for their customers. So they can increase their customer’s satisfaction and retention by more attention to these benefits...|$|R

BD patients exhibited reduced and enhanced N 170 to facial and semantic valence, respectively. The neural source estimation of N 170 was a posterior section of the fusiform gyrus (FG), including the face fusiform area (FFA). Neural generators of N 170 for faces (FG and FFA) were reduced in BD. In these patients, N 170 modulation was associated with social cognition (theory of mind).

60|$|Conditions of Success and Failure in Travel.--An {{exploring}} expedition is daily {{exposed to}} a succession of accidents, any one of which might be fatal to its further progress. The cattle may at any time stray, die, or be stolen; water may not be reached, and they may perish; {{one or more of}} the men may become seriously ill, or the party may be attacked by natives. Hence the success of the expedition depends on a chain of eventualities, each link of which must be a success; for if one link fails at that point, there must be an end of further advance. It is therefore well, especially at the outset of a long journey, not to go hurriedly to work, nor to push forward too thoughtlessly. Give the men and cattle time to become acclimatised, make the bush your home, and avoid unnecessary hardships. Interest yourself chiefly in the progress of your journey, and do not look forward to its end with eagerness. It is better to think of a return to civilisation, not as an end to hardship and a haven from ill, but as a close to an adventurous <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>life.</b> In this way, risking little, and insensibly creeping on, you will make connections, and learn the capabilities of the country, as you advance; all which will be found invaluable in the case of a hurried or disastrous return. And thus, when some months have passed by, you will look back with surprise on the great distance travelled over; for, if you average only three miles a day, at the end of the year you will have advanced 1200, which is a very considerable exploration. The fable of the Tortoise and the Hare is peculiarly applicable to travellers over wide and unknown tracts. It is a very high merit to accomplish a long exploration without loss of health, of papers, or even of comfort.|$|R
