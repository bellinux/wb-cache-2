No other commercial VHF station signed on <b>in</b> <b>Pittsburgh</b> until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E
