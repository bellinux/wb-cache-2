50|$|Fenethylline (BAN, USAN) is a codrug of {{amphetamine}} and theophylline which behaves as a prodrug {{to both of}} {{the aforementioned}} drugs. It is also spelled phenethylline and <b>fenetylline</b> (INN); other names for it are amphetaminoethyltheophylline and amfetyline. The drug was marketed {{for use as a}} psychostimulant under the brand names Captagon, Biocapton, and Fitton.|$|E
40|$|Four pigeons {{were trained}} to discnminate {{injections}} of d-am-phetamine (AMPH; 2. 0 mg/kg i. m.) from saline with responding maintained under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule offood delivery. When drugs used therapeutioally as anoreccs were tested, they con-sistendy produced greater than 80 % of AMPH-appropnate re-sponding. The order of potency for substifuting for AMPH was: mazindol> AMPH = phenmetrazine = phentermine> chior-phentern*ie = phendimetrazine = dlethyipropion> clortermine = mefenorex. Other anorectics such as phenyipropanolamine (0. 3 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and fenfluramine (1. 0 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) only sub-stituted paralIy for AMPH whereas benzphetamine (1. 0 -i 00. 0 mg/kg) resufted primarily in saline-appropriate responding. Corn-pounds related to AMPH in biochemical mechanism of action or psychomotor stimulant activity also were tested. Methyipheni-date (0. 1 - 3. 0 mg/kg), piribedil (0. 3 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0. 03 - 1. 0 mg/kg) shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH whereas bupropion (1. 0 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and propyihexed-nne (1 0. 0 - 1 00. 0 mg/kg) substituted for AMPH in two of three pigeons tested. In contrast, caffeine and <b>fenetylline</b> resulted prindpally in saline-appropriate responding. Compounds from pharmacological classes not related to AMPH, such as morphine, diazepam and phencydildine, failed to substitute for AMPH. In general, compounds with anorectic and/or stimulant properties shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH. The DS properties of psychomotor stimulants have been studied extensively in several species, including pigeons (de l...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe <b>fenetylline</b> (captagon) tablets (an {{amphetamine}} like substance) are a stimulant drugs {{which are}} widely used in the Arabian Peninsula. ObjectivesThe {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of acute heart failure in patients using captagon tablets. MethodsFrom September, 2009, through December, 2011, 280 consecutive patients with acute dilated cardiomyopathy and acute heart failure syndrome presented to emergency department in one tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups group I (40 patients) were captagon users and group II (240) were captagon non-users. Captagon use was elicited mainly by history taking on admission. Patients with coronary artery disease were excluded. ResultsFourteen percent of patients (40 patients) were captagon users. Captagon users were younger (mean age in years of 23 ± 12 vs. 28 ± 9) and almost all of them were male (98 % vs. 72 %). About 40 % of captagon users were alcohol users and about 92 % of them were smokers. Overall, captagon users had higher risk of in-hospital death (7 % vs. 4 %, p value < 0. 05), cardiogenic shock (15 % vs. 8 %, p value < 0. 05), pulmonary tuberculosis (7 % vs. 1 %, p value < 0. 05) and recurrent admission with heart failure (35 % vs. 24 %, p value < 0. 05). After adjustment for baseline variability, captagon use was found to be an independent risk factor of death and for recurrent admission in patients presented with cardiomyopathy and acute heart failure. ConclusiosCaptagon use was found to be an independent risk factor of death and other morbidities in patients presented with cardiomyopathy and acute heart failure. Our study underscores the importance of improving education concerning the cardiac risks of captagon use...|$|E
