500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode and show, calling them, [...] "at best, a mediocre adventure in detective comedy television". He considered the episode [...] "mindless" [...] {{when compared to}} Monk, which preceded the episode. Moriarty stated that, when not comparing Psych to other shows, the episode is still [...] "making you wonder what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> {{in the minds of}} the show's writers and producers". He questioned the show's ability to last due to having to continue the fake psychic concept, and called detectives Lassiter and O'Hara [...] "completely unlikeable". Moriarty stated that things in the installment [...] "simply don't make any sense". He questioned whether the show would be able to last more than one season, and said that [...] "we highly recommend you continue to take a pass on Psych and save yourself from the mindlessness of it all". The installment was given a rating of 6, or [...] "okay", tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season, with the preceding episode, [...] "Spellingg Bee".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already starting to think, 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E

500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E

That's why I like to play outdoor festivals-because people will just dance. Theatre audiences need to ask themselves: 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on?</b> We're asking these musicians to come and perform and then we sit there and draw all the energy out of the air.' That's why after a while I need a rest. It's {{too much of a}} drain. Often I don't allow that. I just play to the goddess of music-and I know she's dancing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1996, Iowa coach Hayden Fry {{told reporters}} that he had hired a new {{defensive}} coordinator and added, [...] "I don't anticipate Milan being back. Un-unh." [...] The following day, Vooletich told reporters {{he wanted to stay}} at Iowa, but that seemed unlikely based on Fry's comment. [...] Vooletich {{said he did not know}} what was going on: [...] "I'll be damned if I know. [...] He might think I'm looking for a job, but I'm not. [...] I'm going to sit down and talk with him and find out what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> ... This has just devastated me."

5000|$|At the 1974 FIFA World Cup, Zaire {{were placed}} in Group 2 along with Scotland, Yugoslavia (home of Zaire coach and 1970 Morocco coach Blagoja Vidinić), and Brazil. In their first match against Scotland, they {{impressed}} with their fast attacking style, and lost just 0-2. Scottish centre-half Jim Holton said after the match [...] "Let's face it, we underestimated them.

2500|$|Madison's sex {{scene with}} Ethan was heavily criticised. 1UP.com's David Wolinsky called {{it one of}} the [...] "least {{flattering}} nudity" [...] in video gaming, calling it [...] "passionless humping", as well as calling her shower scene ubiquitous. Neon Kelly, for VideoGamer.com, pointed to Heavy Rain {{as an example of how}} games still struggle to show romance, wondering [...] "What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the head of Madison Paige?" [...] Mikel Reparaz, again from GamesRadar, called it one of [...] "gaming's most horrifying sex scenes", feeling that it didn't fit either character's motivations and how it highlighted its characters' uncanny valley tendencies. Mike Thomsen, for IGN, criticised Madison, calling her [...] " [...] realistic character, but a male fantasy nonetheless", noting numerous moments where the game sexualised her, and how she didn't [...] "seem to have any concept of her own sexual interests or wants unless they're in the context of the men who surround her", noting that the player controlled Ethan during the sex scene and chose whether or not to have the relationship as him.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the artists}} that Barber has {{recognized}} {{for their contributions}} to [...] practice - Martha Rosler, Adrian Piper, Guerrilla Art Action Group, Critical Art Ensemble and WochenKlausur, among others - he gave a priviled role to the Situationist International as an exemplary model of operative art. [...] The SI and the students they influenced participated in occupations, sit-ins, teach-ins, theatrical agit-prop events {{and other forms of}} protest. [...] The SI endorsed the fundamental importance of intervention as a post-theoretical and practical aspect of their critique of the [...] "Society of the Spectacle" [...] - as theorized by Guy Debord. [...] Among the theoretically informed strategies that were developed by the SI is the constructed situation. [...] The constructed situation is bound to be collective both in its inception and development. [...] However, it seems that at least during an initial experimental period, responsibility must fall on one particular individual. [...] This individual must, so to speak, be the 'director' of the situation. [...] For example, in terms of one particular situationist project - revolving around the meeting of several friends one evening - one would expect (a) an initial period of research by the team, (b) the election of a director responsible for co-ordinating the basic elements for the construction of the decor, and for working out a number of interventions, (c) the actual people living the situation who have taken part in the whole project both theoretically and practically, and (d) a few passive spectators not knowing what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> should be reduced to action.|$|E
