5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers,</b> finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E

That October, Grant {{suspended}} habeas corpus {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent federal troops {{to enforce the law}} there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers.</b> That same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E

25|$|The third great wave of {{domestic}} migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952–53. Many soldiers who returned after World War II {{made use of}} the GI Bill and went to college. Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in the job market. The women left their homes for the factories <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers.</b> By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island.|$|E
25|$|The Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow laws {{across the}} South. A second {{migration}} {{appears to be}} underway, with African Americans from the North moving to the South <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers.</b> While race relations are still a contentious issue in the South, the region surpasses {{the rest of the}} country in many areas of integration and racial equality. According to 2003 report by researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Virginia Beach, Charlotte, Nashville-Davidson, and Jacksonville were the four most integrated of the nation's fifty largest cities, with Memphis at number six. Southern states tend to have a low disparity in incarceration rates between blacks and whites relative to {{the rest of the country}}.|$|E
25|$|Marguerite Patten has {{described}} Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. Brian Turner {{has said that}} he respects Fanny's career and Delia Smith has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series The Way We Cooked in an episode dedicated to Cradock and Graham Kerr, Keith Floyd and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her cookery books sold <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers.</b> In the third series of The F Word, Gordon Ramsay held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.|$|E

25|$|Production delays {{meant the}} DMC-12 {{did not reach}} the {{consumer}} market until January 1981 (nearly {{a decade after the}} company was founded), and in the interim the new car market had slumped considerably due to the 1980 US economic recession. This was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public, who generally felt the uniqueness of the DMC-12's styling did not compensate for the higher price and lower horsepower relative to other sport coupes on the market. While interest in the DMC-12 quickly dwindled, competing models with lower price tags and more powerful engines (such as the Chevrolet Corvette) sold <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers</b> during 1980-81 in spite of the ongoing recession. By February 1982, {{more than half of the}} roughly 7,000 DMC-12s produced remained unsold, DMC was $175 million in debt, and the Dunmurry factory was placed in receivership.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} 50 years {{there have been}} great changes toward gender {{equality}} in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the feminist movement of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women had also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right {{back out of the}} labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the baby boomers. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers,</b> they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.|$|E
25|$|A monokini, more {{commonly}} referred to as a topless swimsuit and sometimes referred to as a unikini, is a women's one-piece swimsuit equivalent to the lower half of a bikini. In 1964, Rudi Gernreich, an Austrian fashion designer, designed the original monokini in the US. Gernreich also invented its name, and the word monokini is first recorded in English that year. Gernreich's monokini looked like a one-piece swimsuit suspended from two halter straps in the cleavage of bared breasts. It had only two small straps over the shoulders, leaving the breasts bare. Despite the reaction of fashion critics and church officials, shoppers purchased the monokini <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers</b> that summer, though very few monokinis were ever worn in public. By the end of the season, Gernreich had sold 3000 swimsuits at $24 apiece, which meant a tidy profit for such a minuscule amount of fabric. It was not very successful in the USA, where although allowing the sexes equal exposure above the waist, have never accepted it for the beach. Many women who wanted to sunbathe topless simply wore the bottom part of a bikini. Manufacturers and retailers quickly adapted to selling tops and bottoms separately. Gernreich later created the lesser known pubikini.|$|E

500|$|During a 20-year playing career, Bradman {{consistently}} {{scored at}} a level that made him, in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, [...] "worth three batsmen to Australia". A controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring. As a captain and administrator, Bradman was committed to attacking, entertaining cricket; he drew spectators <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers.</b> He hated the constant adulation, however, and it affected how he dealt with others. The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who thought him aloof and wary.

Oil in affected coastal areas increased erosion due to the death of mangrove trees and marsh grass.

2500|$|Rumors abounded that Johnson's real {{motive was}} {{to operate the}} Athletics in Kansas City for a few years, then move the team to Los Angeles (the Brooklyn Dodgers would later move there from New York City after the 1957 season). [...] Whatever the concern about the move to Kansas City, fans turned out <b>in</b> <b>record</b> <b>numbers</b> for the era. In 1955, the Kansas City Athletics drew 1,393,054 to Municipal Stadium, a club record easily surpassing the {{previous}} record of 945,076 in 1948; in fact, it was the third-highest attendance figure in the majors, behind only the all-powerful Yankees and the also recently relocated Milwaukee Braves in the National League (1953-1969). That number would never be approached again while the team was in Kansas City, and would remain the club record for attendance until 1982—the Athletics' 15th season in Oakland. [...] This was mainly because the A's were barely competitive; in five years under Johnson's ownership, the closest they got to a winning record was 1958, when they finished 73-81, eight games below [...]500 and 19 games out of first.|$|E
