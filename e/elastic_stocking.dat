40|$|Abstract: Asset pricing {{formulas}} {{generated from}} representative agent models help in computing the fundamental values of assets that investors plan to hold forever. In contrast, {{in an economy}} with heterogeneous agents and active trading, stock prices will persistently deviate from the expected fundamental value even without introducing any explosive bubbles. Particularly, the introduction of heterogeneous prior beliefs leads to an additional non-trivial expected gain from active trading (EGFAT) in the new asset pricing formula, since the law of iterated expectations fails to apply to a market where the beliefs of marginal investors determine the trading prices. Provided informational frictions, the new framework suggests that speculative manipulations may be profitable in stock markets imposing daily fluctuation limits {{in an effort to}} discourage speculative tradings. In addition, this paper proposes how to derive endogenously <b>elastic</b> <b>stock</b> demand in a market with heterogeneous agents, while inelastic stock demand is a common feature in asset pricing formulas based on representative agent models.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{estimate}} the supply elasticity of the fish regarding the variationsin {{one of the most}} important running costs (fuel cost) for the Galician fleet in the Celtic Sea. The Spanish fleet involved in the Celtic Sea fishing grounds, also known as the _ 300 fleet_, as when Spain joined the EEC it was made up of this number of vessels, presently has 199 vessels (the 70 % of them operate from Galicia). This fleet mainly catches hake (merlucius merlucius), anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and Lophius budegassa), horse mackerel (trauchurus trauchurus), megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) and nephrops. Although it is currently possible to associate specific target species with particular fleets, various quantities of hake, anglerfish, megrim and nephrops are taken together, depending on the gear type. A supply function for each species has been estimated as an expression that depends on the price of fish, price of other fish landed by the fleet and the fuel price. The preliminary results indicate that the supply of some species is more elastic regarding the fluctuations in fuel prices than other ones. It could explain the strategy of the fleet for selecting the less <b>elastic</b> <b>stocks</b> to the fuel costs...|$|R

DesignRandomised controlled trial. PatientsA total of 104 consecutive patients with primary complete incompetence of the GSV treated by inversion stripping of the GSV. MethodsPostoperatively treated limbs underwent elastic bandaging for 3 days. Volunteers were randomised to wear a compression stocking for additional 4 weeks (intervention group) or no compression stocking (control group). The primary outcome was limb oedema as assessed by photoelectric leg volume measurement. Secondary outcome measures were pain scores, postoperative complications and return to full work. ResultsThe control leg volume was 3657 ml (standard deviation, SD 687) preoperatively and 3640 ml (SD 540) 4 weeks postoperatively (non significant, N. S.). The stocking leg volume was 3629 ml (SD 540) preoperatively, falling to 3534 ml (SD 543) (P< 0. 01) 4 weeks postoperatively. The difference in leg volume between both the groups was not statistically significant. Patients in the control group resumed work earlier (control 11 days, stocking 15 days, P= 0. 02, Mann–Whitney test). No difference was observed in the number and type of complication and in pain scores during the 4 -week follow-up period.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{assessed}} whether individualized shortened {{duration of}} <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stocking</b> (ECS) therapy after acute {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) is feasible without increasing the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). MethodsAt the outpatient clinic of the Maastricht University Medical Centre, 125 consecutive patients with confirmed proximal DVT were followed for 2 years. Villalta scores were assessed on four consecutive visits; 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the acute event. Reflux was assessed once by duplex testing. After 6 months, patients with scores ≤ 4 on the Villalta clinical score {{and in the absence}} of reflux were allowed to discontinue ECS therapy. If reflux was present, two consecutive scores ≤ 4 were needed to discontinue ECS therapy. ResultsECS therapy was discontinued in 17 % of patients at 6 months, in 48 % at 12 months, and in 50 % at 24 months. Reflux on duplex testing was present in 74 / 101 (73. 3 %) tested patients and was not associated with the onset of PTS. At the 6 -month visit, the cumulative incidence of PTS was 13. 3 %, at 12 months 17. 0 %, and at 24 months 21. 1 %. Varicosities/venous insufficiency (present at baseline) was significantly associated with PTS; hazard ratio 3. 2 (1. 2 - 9. 1).

40|$|Post-thrombotic {{syndrome}} (PTS) is {{a common}} complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Poor quality treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is {{a risk factor for}} PTS. We hypothesised that treatment with the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) rivaroxaban may lower PTS incidence as compared to enoxaparin/VKA, as DOACs have a more stable pharmacologic profile than VKA. We performed a post-hoc sub-group analysis of the Einstein DVT trial (n= 3449). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare the cumulative incidence of PTS between the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin/VKA groups. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We included 336 patients {{with a mean age of}} 58 +/- 16 years and a median follow-up after index DVT of 57 months (interquartile range 48 - 64). Of these, 162 (48 %) had been treated with rivaroxaban and 174 (52 %) with enoxaparin/VKA. The cumulative PTS incidence at 60 months follow-up was 29 % in the rivaroxaban group and 40 % in the enoxaparin/VKA group. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, previous VTE, ipsilateral recurrent DVT, extent of DVT, idiopathic DVT, duration of anticoagulant treatment, compliance to assigned study medication, <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stocking</b> use and active malignancy, the HR of PTS development for rivaroxaban was 0. 76 (95 % CI: 0. 51 - 1. 13).

40|$|AbstractTraumatic {{vascular}} {{injuries to}} the lower limb are frequent in athletes, particularly in sports characterized by high-speed collisions. However, the diagnosis is not always straightforward, {{for the lack of}} clearly visible abnormalities without provocative testing or appropriate imaging. The failure of an early diagnosis can lead to devastating consequences. In these subjects, it may be useful to investigate the personal susceptibility to thrombotic events such as the presence of a hereditary hypercoagulable state. We experienced a case of a soccer player with progressive swelling and severe pain of the calf after a trauma during a football match 3 days previously, who came to our hospital for suspected deep vein thrombosis, confirmed by echo-Doppler ultrasound.

The effect of walking on a treadmill for 50 minutes in the evening wearing elastic compression stockings on pain and edema was evaluated in a prospective randomized crossover clinical trial. In Assessment 1, the legs of participants were measured by volumetry at 7 : 00 a. m. and they were asked to perform their normal daily activities and to return at 4 : 00 p. m. Forty-two legs of 21 female patients with ages of the participants ranged from 32 to 72 years with signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease.

40|$|BackgroundIt {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that the loss of}} compression pressure of inelastic bandages is associated with a loss of efficacy in contrast to elastic material, which maintains its pressure and performance. This study compared the effect exerted by inelastic bandages vs elastic compression stockings on the venous pumping function in patients with severe superficial venous insufficiency immediately after application and 1 week later. MethodsEjection fraction (EF) of the calf pump was measured in 18 patients presenting with bilateral reflux in the great saphenous vein (CEAP C 3 -C 5) without any compression and immediately after application of an inelastic bandage on one leg and an <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stocking</b> on the other leg. Measurements were repeated 1 week later, before compression removal. EF was measured using a plethysmographic technique. The changes of interface pressure of the applied compression products were recorded simultaneously with EF measurements. ResultsAfter application, bandages and stockings achieved a significant improvement of EF (P <. 001) that was much more pronounced in the bandaged legs. The median resting pressure was 45 mm Hg (interquartile range, 41 - 48. 5 mm Hg) under the stockings and 64. 5 mm Hg (interquartile range, 51 - 80 mm Hg) under the bandages. After 1 week, EF was still significantly improved in the bandaged leg (P <. 001), but not under the stockings. At this time, the pressure under the stockings was only slightly reduced (5. 9 % supine, 3. 6 % standing), but the mean pressure loss under the bandages was much higher (54. 3 % supine, 35. 4 % standing). ConclusionThe findings supporting inelastic compression are important in explaining the benefits of its use in chronic venous insufficiency. Inelastic bandages maintain their superior efficacy on the venous pumping function after a wearing time of 1 week, despite a significant loss of pressure...|$|R
40|$|This chapter about {{antithrombotic}} {{therapy for}} venous thromboembolic disease {{is part of}} the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126 : 179 S- 187 S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1 A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1 C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1 C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2. 0 (Grade 1 A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1 A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1 A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2. 5 (INR range, 2. 0 to 3. 0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1 A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3. 1 to 4. 0) [Grade 1 A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1. 5 to 1. 9) compared to INR range of 2. 0 to 3. 0 (Grade 1 A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stocking</b> (Grade 1 A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1 A).

Interface pressure of the 2 compression devices was simultaneously recorded both at B 1  =  12  cm above ankle, C = just above widest part of calf. ResultsThe mean increase of EF produced by PECS was + 75 % (95 CI 48, 7 - 101, 3) compared with + 32 % (95 %CI 16, 8 - 48, 6) with GECS (P <  0. 001). There was a significant correlation between EF and the stocking pressure measured at calf level during standing and walking. ConclusionStockings exerting a higher pressure on the calf than on the ankle show a greater efficacy in increasing the venous ejection fraction from the leg...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} conducted' to compare between {{the effect of}} ankle aerobic {{training}} with and without elastic compression stocking on chronic venous insufficiency among patients with varicose vein. Subjects; Twenty four subjects (7 maJe and 17 female) with primary varicose vein of the lower limb were randomly selected and referred from the vascular departments of AI-Kasr El Aini Hospital after being clinically evaluated by their vascular specialist according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Their age ranged from 30 - 50 years. Materials: Venous color duplex to determine the luminal diameters or the cress section (in millimeter) of the long saphenous vein (CsGSV), Push-pull dynamometer For isotonic measurement of muscle strength, and Tape measurement to measure calf muscle circumference {{had been used in}} this study. Procedures: All the subjects were assigned into two study groups. Subjects enrolled in group I had performed pedal ergometer ankle training for six weeks without elastic compression stocking, while subjects of group II had performed the same exercise training in addition to wearing the <b>elastic</b> <b>stocking</b> for the same six weeks period. Results: The statistical analysis of the data had showed that pedal ergometer training had significantly increased the calf muscle isotonic strength, and significantly reduced the diameter of the great saphenous vein at the level of knee and ankle. On the other hand wearing the elastic compression stocking in addition to exercise training had failed to add more significant improvement to the tested variables...|$|E
40|$|Objective/backgroundTreatment for leg oedema {{conventionally}} {{starts with}} compression bandaging followed by elastic stockings once swelling is reduced. The {{aim was to}} investigate if a kit consisting of a liner and outer stocking, each exerting 20  mmHg of pressure, would be equally effective in achieving and maintaining volume reduction compared with short-stretch bandaging (2 weeks) followed by a class II (23 – 33  mmHg) stocking (2  weeks). MethodsForty legs (28 patients) with chronic venous oedema were randomised to either short-stretch bandages applied weekly for 2 weeks, followed by an <b>elastic</b> <b>stocking</b> for 2 weeks (group A) or a light stocking (“liner”) for 1 week followed by superimposing a second stocking for 3 weeks (group B). Interface pressures and leg volumes were measured weekly. ResultsDespite differences in the pressure (median ± interquartile range) applied (bandage: 67  mmHg [55. 7 – 73. 0] vs. liner 24. 5  mmHg [21. 2 – 26. 5]) volume reduction after 1 week was equal (12. 8 % [8. 7 – 16. 5] and 13. 0 % [10. 4 – 20. 6]). After 2 weeks (group A: 17. 8 % [10. 6 – 20. 0] vs. group B 16. 2 % [13. 0 – 25. 4]) and 4 weeks (group A: 17. 3 % [9. 6 – 22. 8] vs. group B: 17. 0 % [13. 1 – 24. 1]) volume reductions remained identical. ConclusionsThe initial improvement in leg volume (1 week) was independent of the pressure applied and the reduction was maintained by superimposing a second stocking. This offers a simple alternative for managing leg oedema with reduced staffing costs...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two years there has been im petus towards the use of the {{flexible}} socket in terface in above knee prosthetics. For our pur poses here, it is widely accepted that the flex ible socket is of multiple benefit to the patient. We will concentrate on discussing the different systems available. The history of flexible sockets dates back a number of years. The article by Charles Pri-tham, C. P. O., et. al. "Experience with the Scandinavian Flexible Socket " 1 0 provides a concise summary of this train of development. At the present time, there are numerous flex ible socket systems being used in the United States and throughout the world. These sockets differ in design in two major areas: flexible socket interface and the outer hard socket. The flexible socket is currently being used with three types of support mechanisms: 1. Total hard socket as the support 2. Hard socket with strategic fenestrations 3. True frame design The prosthesis discussed by R. Volkert in the article, "Frame type Socket for Lower Limb Prosthesis" 1 2 is constructed with a frame outer socket and an <b>elastic</b> <b>stocking</b> interface. This system can accommodate stump volume changes, therefore, it appears to be most useful with early amputees. The TC Couple Socket 6 above-knee prosthesis used a polyethylene flexible inter face and an external polypropylene socket. There are no fenestrations in the outer socket, so it doesn't have some of the benefits of sen sory feedback as a fenestrated outer socket would. The advantage of this system is its light weight polypropylene outer socket. Work done at the Institute of Rehabilitatio...|$|E
40|$|Graduated {{compression}} {{devices are}} considered the standard care for management of venous and lymphatic disorders. Recently compression devices exerting a pressure over the calf higher than over the ankle have been {{proved to be more}} effective than traditional graduated devices in increasing the impaired ejection fraction (EF) from the lower leg in patients with venous disease. Aim of this work is presenting an overview of the new concept on progressive compression, its potential benefits and limits. In different series of tests, the EF from the lower leg was assessed in 70 patients with severe reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV). EF was measured by strain gauge plethysmography, in baseline conditions and after applying graduated compression devices or the new inversely graduated or progressive compression (PC) devices. The interface pressure was recorded, simultaneously with the EF, both in the gaiter area (B 1 point) and at the calf (C point) in order to assess the compression pressure profile. EF, severely impaired in patients with GSV reflux, was increased by compression. So called PC devices (both PC <b>elastic</b> <b>stocking</b> and PC inelastic bandages) were significantly more effective than graduated compression in increasing the ejection fraction. The higher the pressure on the calf the higher the EF improvement. Maintaining the same strong pressure over the calf by means of two progressive stockings and increasing the pressure only over the calf to restore a graduated compression didn’t improve the EF. To improve venous pumping function in the ambulant patient stronger compression of the calf is more effective than graduated compression. This {{can be explained by the}} higher amount of blood volume pooled in the calf veins...|$|E
