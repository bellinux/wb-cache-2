40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{historical}} ecology <b>of</b> the Pacific <b>herring,</b> a marine food web resource, in the Gulf of Alaska. It states the hearing conducted by the Alaska Legislature 2 ̆ 7 s House special committee on fisheries on the status and management <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> in Southeast Alaska during which Tlingit fisherman Clarence Jackson of Kake notes the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> in his lifetime. Information on herring ecology based from Native and non-Native individuals from Southeast communities and archaeological site reports reveal that non-Natives in Southeast Alaska have exploited herring with the development <b>of</b> a <b>herring</b> reduction plant. It underscores the need for conservative management <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> populations, monitoring <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> spawning areas, and conducting otolith and ancient DNA studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{absorption}} of acoustic energy in herring schools is studied by echo {{integration of the}} bottom signal under various densities <b>of</b> <b>herring.</b> The investigations were carried out in a fjord in northern Norway, where large schools <b>of</b> adult <b>herring</b> overwinter. The intensity of the bottom signal, expressed by the integrator value (reflected area in square meters per square nautical mile(m^ 2 /NM^ 2)) of the bottom decreased significantly as the density <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> increased. The bottom integrator value decreased exponentially from 1. 39 to 0. 36 · 10 ^ 6 as the area density <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> increased from 0 to 550 · 10 ^ 3 corresponding {{to an increase in}} number <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> per square meter of 0 - 180.

40|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> larvae {{in relation}} to environmental conditions and the occurrence of possible prey and predator organisms was studied during a 4 -day period on a permanent station in the northern North Sea in September 1999. The vertical distribution <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> larvae was sampled in 20 -m intervals {{by means of a}} multiple-closing net. To resolve the small-scale patchiness <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> larvae and planktonic prey and predator organisms, a towed in-situ video system was used, the Ichthyoplankton Recorder. A diel vertical migration <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> larvae was observed with different intensities depending on their body length. Small larvae (16 mm) showed the highest abundances in the upper water layers during the day and were concentrated in deeper water layers during the night. The presented results appear to be relevant for individual-based modelling of the fate <b>of</b> larval <b>herring</b> populations...|$|R
40|$|Atlantic saithe (Pollachius virens) and Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} herring (Clupea harengus) represent two of {{the most}} abundant and ecologically important fish species in the Northeast Atlantic. The two species co-occur in the Vesterålen/Lofoten area during the wintering <b>of</b> <b>herring,</b> but the temporal and spatial overlap between species in different scales as well as their trophic interactions is otherwise largely unknown. Saithe is a potentially important predator on herring. In the present study we found the commercial catches of saithe off western Norway to be closely related to the migration <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> into the coastal spawning grounds, indicating that saithe follow the high concentrations <b>of</b> migrating <b>herring.</b> Acoustic surveys within a defined study area demonstrated that the species overlapped spatially and temporarily. Degree of overlap varied both diurnally and with the maturity status <b>of</b> the <b>herring</b> (pre-spawning, spawning or spent). Concurrent catches <b>of</b> saithe and <b>herring</b> from trawling and gillnets supported an overlap also on the meso-scale. Observations on more fine-scaled behaviour obtained from an underwater rig with highsensity cameras positioned in high-density areas <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> demonstrated that the distribution and behaviour <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> and saithe was closely linked to the diel light cycle and spawning <b>of</b> <b>herring.</b> When looking at the actual outcome of the interactions between the species on a kind of temporally, integrated spatial microscale, it was observed that stomachs of large saithe (> 50 cm) on average contained 2 – 3 herring, while the stomachs of smaller saithe were filled with herring eggs. This suggests a considerable predation pressure by saithe on different life stages <b>of</b> <b>herring...</b>|$|R

40|$|After {{decades of}} {{overexploitation}} and severe depletion, Atlantic herring stocks in {{waters of the}} northeastern United States have recovered. Fishery managers now consider the herring resource to be underexploited. Nevertheless, some fishery managers and sustainable fishery advocates in New England have {{expressed concern that the}} fishery management plan may not adequately consider the importance <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> as prey for marine mammals, seabirds, and piscivorous fish. Several studies suggest that consumption by these predators is significant, yet trophic interactions are not explicitly considered in stock assessment models. Instead, as in most fisheries stock assessments, predation is subsumed within the natural mortality rate, and no empirical estimates <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> consumption are used in the models. The goal {{of the present study was}} to assess the consumption <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> by marine mammals and to compare this level of consumption with estimates of natural mortality derived from herring stock assessment models. Using the most recent estimates of abundance and the best available data on diet, we estimated total annual consumption <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> by eight marine mammal species in the Gulf of Maine. Our results indicate that marine mammals consume 93, 802 - 189, 898 metric tons (mt; 1 metric ton = 1000 kg) <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> annually. In addition, piscivorous fish and seabirds are important predators <b>of</b> <b>herring.</b> We estimate that the consumption <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> by these upper trophic level predators may have exceeded the estimate of natural mortality used in stock assessment models by more than fourfold in 1991. We suggest that fisheries management must move beyond a single-species approach to one that includes formal consideration of trophic relationships...|$|R

40|$|Herring {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fish species in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea, with an annual catch exceeding 2 million tonnes. Although a large part of these fish is used for human consumption, as much as 85 % <b>of</b> the <b>herring</b> is used for industrial production of fish meal and fish oil. There is a general wish to increase the utilisation <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> for human consumption. Thus, it was important to study the various parameters which influence the quality <b>of</b> <b>herring,</b> and in particular how these paramenters are controlled by biological factors. A major reason behind quality problems arising during post harvest handling <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> is its high content of compounds that efficiently catalyzes the development of rancidity, pigmentation, texture changes and loss of nutritional value...|$|R

40|$|AIM: Few dietary {{studies have}} looked beyond fish oil {{to explain the}} {{beneficial}} metabolic effects of a fish-containing diet. Our aim was to study whether addition <b>of</b> <b>herring,</b> or sub-fractions <b>of</b> <b>herring,</b> could counteract negative metabolic effects known to be induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. METHODS: Rats were given six different diets: standard pellets; high energy diet with chicken mince (HiE control); high energy diet with herring mince (HiE herring); and high energy diet with chicken mince and either herring oil (HiE herring oil), herring press juice, PJ (HiE PJ) or herring low molecular weight PJ (HiE LMW-PJ). Factors associated with the metabolic syndrome were measured. RESULTS: There were no differences in energy intake or body weight between the groups, but animals fed high energy diets had a higher body fat content compared with the pellet group, although not statistically significant in all groups. Mesenteric adipocyte size was smaller in the HiE herring oil group compared with the HiE control. Glucose clamp studies showed that, compared with the pellet group, the HiE control and HiE herring diets, but not the HiE herring oil diet, induced insulin resistance. Addition <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> or herring oil to the high energy diet decreased total cholesterol levels, triacylglycerols and the atherogenic index compared with the HiE control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that addition <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> or herring oil counteracts negative effects on blood lipids induced by a high energy diet. The lipid component <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> thus seems {{to be responsible for}} these beneficial effects...|$|R
40|$|The whale-watching {{industry}} {{is an important}} component of the New England regional economy with about one million tourism visitors. Humpback whales are the most popular whale-watching targets, whose primary activity in this area is feeding that mainly on herrings. Meanwhile, the value <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> fisheries is more than $ 20 M annually and it is the major supply for canneries and lobster bait. According to the historical document, over-harvesting <b>of</b> <b>herrings</b> may cause the dramatic depletion of humpback whale stock. This research investigates the economic benefits and losses of the ban on the harvesting for herring in the New England area. I compare the revenue <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> fisheries and whale-watching under different herring harvest levels through integrated economic-ecological analysis. The marine ecosystem side will be modeled through EMAX food web. The socio-economical analysis focuses on the herring fisheries and whale watching market price and quantity. By comparing the two-sided benefits, this research evaluates if herring should be left in the marine ecosystem or harvested. The result indicated that the decrease <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> harvest would not cause dramatic increase of the whale stock,, at least in the short term. Accordingly, the decline <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> landing would not significantly or equally increases the revenue from the whale watching tourism. The result suggests that the current herring fisheries landing might not have a significant impact on the whale population...|$|R

Sidescan sonar data were used to compare bottom habitat characteristics <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> spawning areas vs. non-spawn areas. No significant differences in vegetation or substrate type were detected between areas where herring do and do not spawn. Generalized linear models and analysis of variance models were constructed to predict the probability <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> spawn and estimate egg densities given habitat information collected by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game during herring egg deposition surveys. Habitat characteristics explained 31 % of the deviance in spawn presence and absence and 28 % of the variability in egg densities.
