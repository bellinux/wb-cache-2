40|$|Abstract: The torsion {{fatigue life}} test which {{aimed at the}} {{automotive}} steering shaft designs the test bed of micro-controller based on PIC 16 F 877 and makes the accurate test methods possible. The installation of a torque sensor in series with the magnetic particle brake can detect feedback on the test load. A serial port communication between micro-controller and programmable power supply can automatically adjust the output of current size of programmable power supply, and make torsional load output by the magnetic particle brake constant. The system is not only accurate in statistics testing and capable of memorizing the number of tests but also low cost and of practical value. Steering driveshaft is the core component of steering control mechanism, which is to manipulate the driver turns the steering wheel to the steering force transmission, and ultimately control the car wheel driving directions. In China, the standard automotive industry "car steering <b>driveshaft</b> <b>assembly</b> performance requirements and test methods " (QC/T 649 - 2000), test five trial...|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Westfield XIs are sold as self-build kits without engines {{and designed to}} accept the 1275cc A-series from a donor MG Midget or Austin-Healey Sprite. Owners have fitted a variety of engines, including Coventry Climaxes, Lotus twin-cams and Alfa Romeo engines, although engine fitment {{is limited by the}} small size of the engine bay. The kit is designed to utilise other components from a donor Sprite or Midget: the rear axle (modified by Westfield), gearbox, <b>driveshaft,</b> front upright/brake <b>assembly,</b> radiator, wheels/tyres, steering rack, wiring, and gauges.|$|R
