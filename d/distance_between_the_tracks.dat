40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} a 3 -dimensional (3 D) navigation system using electromagnetically tracked tools to explore its potential in patients. Methods: The 3 D navigation accuracy was quantified on a phantom and in a porcine model using the same setup and vascular interventional suite. A box-shaped phantom with 16 markers was scanned in 5 different positions using computed tomography (CT). The 3 D navigation system registered each CT volume in the magnetic field. A tracked needle was pointed at the physical markers, and <b>the</b> spatial <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracked</b> needle positions and the markers were calculated. Contrast-enhanced CT images were acquired from 6 swine. The 3 D navigation system registered each CT volume in the magnetic field. An electromagnetically tracked guidewire and catheter were visualized in the 3 D image and navigated to 4 specified targets. At each target, <b>the</b> spatial <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracked</b> guidewire tip position and the actual position, verified by a CT control, was calculated. Results: The mean accuracy on the phantom was 1. 2860. 53 mm, and 90 % of the measured distances were # 1. 90 mm. The mean accuracy in swine was 4. 1861. 76 mm, and 90 % of the measured distances were # 5. 73 mm. Conclusion: This 3 D navigation system demonstrates good ex vivo accuracy and is sufficiently accurate in vivo to explore its potential for improved endovascular navigation.

Following the example set by the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, the lines extend from Zwickau Hauptbahnhof to the central markets. As most of the Vogtland network has not been electrified, the train-trams do not use current from the tramwires (as in Karlsruhe) but are driven by diesel engines. Between the Hauptbahnhof and Stadthall there was a link that could be reactivated. From there to Zentrum the train and the tram use the same tracks. To do this, dual-gauge track has been laid; there are three rails, the tram uses metre gauge , and the Vogtlandbahn uses standard gauge, [...] An extra rail was laid next to the tram line so that they share one rail and each use one of the others as appropriate. Since the tramway was only built at this time, a third track and a larger <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> could be planned from the start, making the retrofitting possible. The diesel sets run on the common route under BOStrab procedures, so they were equipped with indicators and brake lights. Because of their breadth, however, they do not operate with road traffic; Äußere Schneeberger Straße is largely closed to car traffic. However, the area used by the tracks can be used by rescue vehicles and rail replacement buses.|$|E

The chart advises whether the meeting or passing of such shipments can be done at track speed or with specific restrictions.

To this end, we develop a realistic DTI software model in which multiple fiber bundles and their geometrical configuration may be specified, also allowing for scenarios in which fiber bundles cross or kiss and which are common bottlenecks of fiber tracking algorithms. Partial voluming, that is the contributions of multiple tissues to a voxel, is taken into account. The model gives us the possibility to compute the diffusion-weighted signal attenuation given certain tissue and scanner parameters. On the tissue side we can model the diffusion coefficients, the principal diffusion direction and the width of the fiber bundles. On the scanner side, we can model the diffusion time, the strength and direction of the applied diffusion gra dient and the width of the diffusion pulse.

For these treatments, correct positioning of microcatheter tips, microguide wire tips, or coils is essential. Techniques to detect such devices may facilitate endovascular interventions. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for tracking of microcatheter tips during fluoroscopically guided neuroendovascular interventions. A sequence of fluoroscopic images (1, 024 [*]×[*] 1, 024 [*]×[*] 12  bits) was acquired using a C-arm angiography system as a microcatheter was passed through a carotid phantom which was on top of a head phantom. The carotid phantom was a silicone cylinder containing a simulated vessel with the shape and curvatures of the internal carotid artery. The head phantom consisted of a human skull and tissue-equivalent material. To detect the microcatheter in a given fluoroscopic frame, a background image consisting of an average of the four previous frames is subtracted from the current frame, the resulting image is filtered using a matched filter, and the position of maximum intensity in the filtered image is taken as the catheter tip position in the current frame. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracked</b> position and <b>the</b> correct position (error distance) was measured in each of the fluoroscopic images.

40|$|Abstract. Radio-frequency (RF) {{catheter}} ablation {{has become}} the standard treatment of atrial fibrillation if pharmacotherapy fails. As an alternative to traditional RF standard ablation catheters, single-shot devices have received more and more interest. One group of these devices are cryo-balloon catheters. Such catheters are designed to electrically isolate a pulmonary vein (PV) {{with only a few}} applications, ideally only one. Whereas standard radio-frequency ablation catheters operate point by point, cryo-balloon devices need to be positioned antrally to the pulmonary vein ostium before freezing. If a good seal can be achieved far enough outside of the pulmonary veins, the cryo-balloon is an effective and safe ablation device. The catheters are inserted through a transseptal sheath and are inflated using liquid nitrogen. Single-shot devices, when used successfully, promise a reduction of procedure time and X-ray exposure. Single-shot devices based on ablation energies other than RF, may not carry electrodes or electromagnetic sensors. This makes it difficult to visualize them using standard EP mapping systems. As a result, fluoroscopic imaging is needed. Unfortunately, the inflated balloon may be difficult to see under X-ray. To improve this situation, we propose a new method that <b>tracks</b> and enhances <b>the</b> visualization of a cryo-balloon catheter under fluoroscopic imaging. The method involves a 2 -D template of the cryo-balloon that is manually initialized and then <b>tracks</b> <b>the</b> balloon device during live X-ray imaging. To improve visualization, a 2 -D ellipse is overlaid onto the fluoroscopic imaging to highlight the position of the balloon catheter. <b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> error was calculated as <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracked</b> catheter template and the manually segmented catheter.
