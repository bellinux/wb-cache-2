50|$|The {{frequency}} {{range of the}} PRC-6 covers the 6 meter amateur radio band (50-54 MHz in the US and Canada, 50-52 MHz in the United Kingdom), and the many versions of these sets are relatively available and cheap (around £30-40 in the UK) in comparison to other vintage military radios. As a result, many examples {{have been put on}} the air, although practical operation is hampered by the necessity of building new, custom power <b>supplies</b> (the original <b>dry</b> <b>batteries,</b> which <b>supplied</b> +1.5, +4.5, +45 and +90 volt outputs, being unobtainable or display pieces only) and the limited output power and range. In addition, a separate crystal and laborious retuning is required every time a frequency change takes place. For this reason in the US 51 MHz is used as a net frequency at many radio events, necessitating only the one crystal.|$|R

Later tubes had 1.4 volt filaments {{to run from}} <b>dry</b> <b>batteries.</b> With the introduction of mains powered equipment, indirectly heated tubes became more common and usually (though not always) required 4 volts in Europe and 6.3 volts in America. The latter became the standard voltage after the Second world war. One notable exception was that rectifier tubes often had 5 volt filaments or heaters which usually {{had to have a}} separate supply anyway.|$|R
