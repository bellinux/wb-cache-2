25|$|The {{mainland}} {{areas of}} Galveston County, north of Galveston Island, have also become increasingly divided on political issues. <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> presence in La Marque and Texas City, {{both of which}} are home to large numbers of unionized refinery workers and African Americans, a traditionally Democratic voting bloc. However, Democrats' strength in this area is increasingly being superseded by newer developments in the northern areas of the county around Friendswood and League City that favor Republicans.|$|E
25|$|A NY1-Marist Poll {{released}} show of November 1ed 44 {{percent of}} New York voters supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, while only 21 percent supported the Tea Party. A survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted from November 10 to 14 found that majorities of nearly identical size felt that Occupy Wall Street, and the Tea Party, respectively, {{did not share}} their values. A November 3 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 30 percent of American voters have a favorable view of the protests, while 39 percent do not. The same poll found that among independent voters, 29 percent have a favorable view opposed to 42 percent who have an unfavorable view, while 45% of <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> favorable view opposed to 19% who have an unfavorable view. A Pew Research Center poll, released December 15, 2011, found that nearly {{three months after the}} start of OWS, 44% support the Occupy Wall Street movement and 35% oppose it. Americans overwhelmingly agree with the concerns raised by the movement, but more disapprove of the tactics used than approve.|$|E
2500|$|Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams {{condemned}} the shootings, saying that those responsible had [...] "no support, no strategy {{to achieve a}} United Ireland.

2500|$|Irving Berlin quipped, [...] "The {{world would}} not be in such a snarl, had Marx been Groucho instead of Karl". In his book The Groucho Phile, Marx says [...] "I've been a liberal Democrat all my life", and [...] "I frankly find Democrats a better, more {{sympathetic}} crowd.... I'll continue to believe that <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater regard for the common man than Republicans do". However, Marx also said in a television interview that he disliked the women's liberation movement.|$|E
2500|$|After the 2000 United States Census, Arizona gained two congressional districts. Pastor's former {{territory}} was renumbered as the 7th District, but {{his home}} in Phoenix was drawn into the newly created 4th District. Rather than move to the Phoenix portion of the reconfigured 7th, Pastor opted {{to run in the}} 4th. The newly created district was heavily Democratic and majority-Latino, like Pastor's old district; <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nearly 2-to-1 advantage in registration. He easily won in November. He was reelected six times against nominal Republican opposition. [...] His district was renumbered as the 7th after the 2010 census.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, he {{switched}} parties and ran in North Carolina's 3rd congressional district, which had absorbed {{a large chunk}} of his father's former territory. His race against incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster was initially very close until Jones released a picture of Lancaster jogging with President Bill Clinton, whose socially liberal stands (especially on gays in the military) angered many voters in the district. [...] Although <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large advantage in registered voters, the 3rd has always had a very strong social conservative tint; Jesse Helms in particular had a large base of support there. As part of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Jones defeated Lancaster 53%–47%. [...] With his victory, Jones became the first Republican to represent a significant portion of Eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{majority}} of Kentucky's voters, {{the state has}} traditionally leaned conservative.
