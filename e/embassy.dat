5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the <b>embassy</b> compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the <b>embassy</b> {{with their families and}} about 30 were hired as guards and protected the <b>embassy</b> throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed for some time and the <b>embassy</b> was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the <b>embassy</b> compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the <b>Embassy,</b> while some 2,500 evacuees were in the <b>Embassy</b> and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the <b>Embassy</b> to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the <b>Embassy</b> gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or <b>Embassy</b> staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the <b>Embassy</b> compound. Among those arriving at the <b>Embassy</b> were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E

5|$|No threats {{came upon}} the <b>embassy</b> during the day, {{although}} truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by the <b>embassy</b> along Afghoy Road. Only one incident seemed to directly target the <b>embassy.</b> A sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy's water tower (the highest structure in the compound) and came under fire; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Military Cooperation, {{just one}} and a half blocks from the <b>embassy,</b> {{required}} evacuation. Despite its proximity to the <b>embassy,</b> an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the <b>embassy</b> at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside the <b>embassy</b> by the security detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the <b>embassy</b> desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the <b>embassy.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>embassy</b> party {{left behind}} in Canton in 1518 {{proceeded}} north in January 1520 {{with the rest of}} the Portuguese under Tomé Pires and Fernão Pires de Andrade. The <b>embassy</b> reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, granting the Portuguese <b>embassy</b> a quick audience. However, further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, the Portuguese <b>embassy</b> was sent there to wait for the emperor's return.|$|E

5|$|Although Hasekura's <b>embassy</b> was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity.

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the people in the <b>embassy</b> were captured, three managed to escape—two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor parapet to the Ethiopian <b>Embassy</b> next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz—the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present—briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the hostages were <b>embassy</b> staff—predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer tasked with guarding the <b>embassy.</b> Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from Battersea, who had worked for the <b>embassy</b> in various positions since 1947.|$|E
