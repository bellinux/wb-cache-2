500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>not</b> a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E

Life may be black and mad in the second half but Bardamu is not, and he gets to the real end of the night as critic and spectator.

What is attacked may perhaps be summed up as the death-wishes generated by the herds of a machine society, and he is not speaking as 'spokesman of the proletariat' or with any sympathy for a communist one. ...before claiming the book as proletarian literature you have to separate off the author (in the phrase that Radek used) as a man ripe for fascism.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, while Gao was at Emperor Zhuangzong's court, Emperor Zhuangzong {{had asked}} for Gao's advice on {{which of the two}} main rival states — Former Shu and Wu — he should target next. [...] Gao, believing that Former Shu, well-protected by natural defenses, would be {{difficult}} to conquer, and not wanting Emperor Zhuangzong's empire to keep expanding, told Emperor Zhuangzong that he should attack Former Shu first. [...] When the Later Tang army commanded by Guo and Emperor Zhuangzong's son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei conquered Former Shu in 925, Gao was shocked to hear the news while he was dining, such that he dropped his chopsticks on the ground. [...] He stated, [...] "This is this old man's fault!" [...] Liang responded, [...] "You need not worry. [...] The Lord of Tang, after he conquered Shu lands, will be even more arrogant. [...] He will surely be destroyed soon, and <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>not</b> going to be a blessing to us?" [...] Subsequently, Emperor Zhuangzong's wife Empress Liu, believing that Guo had stripped the Shu territory of its wealth, ordered Guo killed, leading to the collapse of the Later Tang army morale and Emperor Zhuangzong's death in a mutiny. [...] It was said that when this news arrived at Jiangling, Gao was impressed with and became even more respectful of Liang. [...] It was also around this time that Liang recommended Sun Guangxian to Gao — [...] and Sun would eventually serve as chief strategist to the rulers of Jingnan who would succeed Gao (Gao's son Gao Conghui, grandsons Gao Baorong and Gao Baoxu, and great-grandson Gao Jichong).|$|E

[...] Xu Ziran, {{who was in charge}} of imperial wagons, had gone out on a hunt, and during the hunt, he had damaged a farmer's crops. [...] When the farmer became angry, Xu Ziran fired arrows toward the farmer. [...] Xu Yushi caned Xu Ziran 100 times, but did not report this to the emperor. [...] When the farmer submitted a formal accusation, the accusation was initially put aside by the official Yang Deyi (楊德裔), but another official, Yuan Gongyu (袁公瑜), then resubmitted the accusation directly to the emperor under a pseudonym. [...] Emperor Gaozong, in anger, stated, [...] "Xu Yushi is a chancellor, but when the people's lives and properties were interfered with, he did not report to me. [...] <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>not</b> an abuse of power?" [...] Xu responded, [...] "I serve in a key position of the government, and I serve Your Imperial Majesty with honesty and fairness, and I could not please everyone. [...] That is why I am being attacked. [...] As for abusing power, only someone who commands strong troops or is stationed at a key military post can do so. [...] I am but a civilian who serves the emperor, and I only know how to perfect myself behind closed doors. [...] How can I abuse power?" [...] This caused Emperor Gaozong to be angrier, and he stated, [...] "Are you displeased that you do not command troops?" [...] Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, who happened to be present, stated, [...] "For an imperial subject to have this kind of attitude, death would be too good of a treatment for him!" [...] Emperor Gaozong ordered that Xu Yushi be expelled from his presence and removed from his post.|$|E
