5|$|The Boys Light Up reached No. 4 on the Australian album {{charts and}} {{remained}} in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks. It sold five times platinum: over 280,000 copies, {{and became one of}} the biggest Australian albums of the 1980s. Singer/guitarist/songwriter Guy McDonough (ex-The <b>Flatheads</b> and Bill's younger brother) joined the group in October 1980.|$|E
5|$|By early 1978 Spiff Rouch had {{separated}} into two groups: The <b>Flatheads</b> (including the McDonough brothers and Walker, along with Sean Higgins and Nigel Spencer) and Australian Crawl. The original lineup {{for the latter}} was Reyne as vocalist, Binks on lead guitar, Williams on bass guitar, along with Reyne's younger brother David Reyne on drums and schoolmate Brad Robinson on rhythm guitar. Australian Crawl performed their first live gig in October 1978 and toured the pub circuit.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, <b>flatheads,</b> sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
50|$|Oceanic <b>flathead</b> species (sand <b>flathead,</b> tiger <b>flathead,</b> bar-tailed <b>flathead)</b> are, as named, {{generally}} located more offshore {{than the}} dusky <b>flathead,</b> frequenting the sandy zones around and between coastal reefs, although bar-tailed <b>flathead</b> occur in many estuarine environments, {{for example the}} Swan/Canning River System in Perth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flathead</b> {{grey mullet}} is {{mentioned}} in the Joseon era ichthyology book Jasaneobo (hangul:자산어보, hanja:玆山魚譜) as a fish of exceptional taste and nutritional value. <b>Flathead</b> grey mullet is used in various dishes: grilled, steamed, in jjigae, with noodles, as jeon and hoe. <b>Flathead</b> grey mullet dishes such as sungeojjim (steamed <b>flathead</b> grey mullet) are served for special occasions. The taste of <b>flathead</b> grey mullet is slightly different from season to season. <b>Flathead</b> grey mullet caught in spring and winter has a sweet taste, summer <b>flathead</b> grey mullet is tasteless, and autumn <b>flathead</b> grey mullet tastes fatty and savory.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Bluespotted <b>Flathead,</b> Southern <b>Flathead</b> or Yank <b>Flathead</b> is {{a common}} species of <b>flathead</b> found around the {{southern}} coast and offshore islands of Australia growing to 90 cm and inhabiting a depth of from 8 to 30 metres.|$|R
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and <b>flatheads,</b> eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, <b>flatheads,</b> and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The <b>Flatheads.</b> Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flathead</b> County {{was founded}} in 1893. It {{contains}} much of <b>Flathead</b> Lake, the <b>Flathead</b> Valley, and the <b>Flathead</b> River. All of these natural treasures, originated by glaciers, are named for the unique geological formation of a broad flat valley surrounded by mountains {{at the head of}} a deep glacial lake. Some sources cite the supposed practice of the Salish tribe flattening infants' heads as the origin of the name <b>Flathead,</b> but there is no record of Salish Indians ever having that appearance. Several tribes have long made use of the magnificent <b>Flathead</b> Lake, and the Bitterroot Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d'Oreilles tribes are represented on the <b>Flathead</b> Reservation.|$|R

5000|$|The North Fork <b>Flathead</b> River (Ktunaxa: kqaskanmituk [...] ) is a 153 mi river {{flowing through}} British Columbia, Canada, south into the U.S. state of Montana. It {{is one of}} the three primary forks of the <b>Flathead</b> River, the main inflow of <b>Flathead</b> Lake and a {{tributary}} of the Columbia River via the Clark Fork River and the Pend Oreille River. The river is sometimes considered the upper headwaters of the <b>Flathead</b> River, although the North Fork is its official name in the U.S. Other naming conventions for the river include <b>Flathead</b> River - North Fork, North Fork of <b>Flathead</b> River, and North Fork of the <b>Flathead</b> River.|$|R

25|$|For an {{extended}} period of time—prewar through the early 1950s—the Pontiac was a quiet, solid car, but not especially powerful. It came with a flathead straight eight. Straight 8s were slightly less expensive to produce than the increasingly popular V8s, but they were also heavier and longer. Additionally, the long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, restricting straight 8s to a relatively low compression ratio with a modest redline. However, in this application, inexpensive (yet very quiet) <b>flatheads</b> were not a liability.|$|E
25|$|Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models. These singles were {{available}} either as flathead engines or as overhead valve engines until 1930, {{after which they}} were only available as <b>flatheads.</b> The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while overhead valve versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S. This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, it {{is thought}} that Lewis and Clark's Expedition {{played a major role in}} {{heightening}} tensions between white explorers and the Blackfeet Indians. Despite this notion, Manuel Lisa's party originally interacted peacefully with the Blackfeet. However, it was after Colter and Potts were forced to battle the Blackfeet alongside the <b>Flatheads</b> and Crows that the relations between white explorers/trappers and the Blackfeet nation seemed to deteriorate. This led Major Biddle and many other frontiersman to draw the conclusion that Colter had actually upset relations with the Blackfeet, which was only expounded upon by the notoriety of Colter's Run.|$|E

25|$|Chief American Horse was a Lakota {{historian}} and authored a “winter count” {{he kept on}} a piece of cloth covering over one hundred years of Lakota history, 1775-1878. Lakota years are conceived as extending from the first snow of a winter to the first snow of the next winter. Years are given names based upon significant or unique event that would be easy to recall. For example, Chief Flying Hawk’s Winter Count for 1866 records the Fetterman Incident during Red Cloud’s War as “Wasicu opawinge wica ktepi” or “They killed one hundred white men.” Likewise, 1876 is “Marpiya llute sunkipi” or “They took horses from Red Cloud” (the U.S. Army did after the Battle of the Little Big Horn), 1877 is “Tasunka witko ktepi” or “When they killed Crazy Horse” and 1890 is “Si-tanka ktepi” or “When the killed Big Foot” (the Wounded Knee Massacre). In 1879, American Horse drew the winter count in a sketchbook at the request of William H. Corbusier, an Army surgeon. Corbusier sent it to the Smithsonian together with an explanation of the years provided by the keeper. American Horse said that the winter count had been kept in his family for generations, passed down from his grandfather, to his father, to him. American Horse was born in the year they stole many horses from the <b>Flatheads,</b> or 1840-41. His death is marked in the No Ears calendar for the year 1908-09.|$|E
500|$|Australian Crawl's {{debut album}} The Boys Light Up (1980), also {{produced}} by Briggs for EMI, {{had a number}} of hit singles with songwriting shared around the group and beyond. Tracks from this album included the previously released single [...] "Beautiful People", the title track (written by Reyne and Mark Hudson); [...] "Indisposed" [...] (Brad Robinson, James Robinson, Reyne, Bill McDonough) [...] and [...] "Downhearted" [...] (Sean Higgins, Guy McDonough, Bill McDonough) (from The <b>Flatheads).</b> Brad Robinson's father James Robinson was a Federal Arbitration Court Justice.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{written record}} of the tribes is from their meeting with the Lewis and Clark Expedition (September 4, 1805). Lewis and Clark came there and asked for horses but {{eventually}} ate the horses due to starvation. The <b>Flatheads</b> also appear in {{the records of the}} Roman Catholic Church at St. Louis, Missouri, to which they sent four delegations to request missionaries (or [...] "Black Robes") to minister to the tribe. Their request was finally granted, and a number of missionaries, including Pierre-Jean De Smet, S.J., were eventually sent. The <b>Flatheads</b> are also located in Sula, Montana.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flathead</b> Indian Reservation, {{located in}} western Montana on the <b>Flathead</b> River, {{is home to}} the Bitterroot Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d'Oreilles Tribes - also known as theConfederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the <b>Flathead</b> Nation. The {{reservation}} was created through the July 16, 1855, Treaty of Hellgate, and reservation has land on four of Montana's counties: Lake, Sanders, Missoula, and <b>Flathead.</b> The <b>Flathead</b> Indian Reservation, west of the Continental Divide, consists of 1938 sq mi (1317000 acres) of forested mountains and valleys.|$|R

2500|$|They were {{incorrectly}} {{called the}} Flathead Indians {{by the first}} Europeans {{who came to the}} area. The <b>Flatheads</b> call themselves Salish, meaning “the people”.

2500|$|During the {{expedition}} John Colter {{was considered to}} be one of the best hunters in the group, and was routinely sent out alone to scout the surrounding countryside for game meat. Colter was often trusted with responsibilities that went beyond hunting and woodsman activities. He was instrumental in helping {{the expedition}} find passes through the Rocky Mountains. In one instance, Colter was handpicked by Clark to deliver a message to Lewis, waylaid at a Shoshone camp, concerning the impracticability of following a route along the Salmon River. In another instance he was charged with retracing a route in the Bitterroot Mountains to recover lost horses and supplies, and not only returned with some of the recovered resources and horses, but also retrieved deer to gift the hospitable Nez Perce tribes and strengthen sick corp members. Colter was also noted by Lewis for his ability to barter with various tribes, an attribute which may have led to his later role with Manuel Lisa. During the expedition Colter never appeared on sick lists, suggesting very advantageous health. He was often one of the few hunters allowed to leave the camp during points of illness and recuperation, proving Lewis and Clark’s trust in him. Another major contribution Colter made to the Corps of Discovery was providing the expedition with the means to swiftly descend the Bitterroot Mountains, allowing access to the Snake River, Columbia River and subsequently, the Pacific Ocean. While hunting far ahead of the main party, Colter encountered three Tushepawe <b>Flatheads.</b> Through non-verbal peace symbols and communication, Colter was able to dissuade the <b>Flatheads</b> to abandon their search for two Shoshones who had stolen twenty three head of horses, and accompany him to the expedition’s camp. One of the young <b>Flatheads</b> agreed to act as the party’s guide down the mountains and through Flathead country, a great advantage in challenging and unfamiliar terrain plagued by a scarcity of game. [...] Once at the mouth of the Columbia River, Colter was among a small group selected to venture to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, as well as explore the seacoast north of the Columbia into present-day Washington state.|$|E
