25|$|The {{biological}} production of hydrogen fuel {{has been a}} topic of research {{since at least the}} 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>residues,</b> consumer waste and other specific agricultural crops. Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called gasification, where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by pyrolysis, a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control. Another source for {{biological production}} of hydrogen fuel is algae. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. Experimental algae farms are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.|$|E

Softwood <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> represents {{a significant amount of}} woody biomass that can be sustainably used to produce biofuel. It also has very low contents of acetyl groups and 5 -carbon polysaccharides, favorable for biofuel production through yeast fermentation. However, it is highly recalcitrant to enzymatic saccharification due to high bark and lignin content. Most existing pretreatment processes are unable to remove this recalcitrance. Sulfite pretreatment to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocelluloses (SPORL) has demonstrated unparalleled performance for bioconversion of softwoods.

30|$|This {{research}} {{highlights the}} importance of a life cycle analysis to estimate the full life-cycle GHG emission balance and economic feasibility of biochar systems. This analysis was conducted based on various optimized pyrolysis parameters for agricultural wastes of corn fodder and <b>forest</b> <b>residue.</b> The GHG emissions avoided for both corn fodder and <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> showed a reduction in emissions (CO 2 e Mg− 1 feedstock d.w.). The stabilized carbon in the biochar was the main contributor to these reductions. The reductions in emissions attributable to soil sequestration of stabilized carbon in biochar (C sink) and to electricity and heat generation during pyrolysis were, respectively, 38.6 and 44.3  % greater for corn fodder than <b>forest</b> <b>residue.</b> A relative GHG analysis found that the optimization of a biomass pyrolysis system for biochar production to be better suited to soil sequestration of stable carbon than as a fuel source. The economic viability of the pyrolysis-biochar system is largely dependent on the costs of feedstock production, pyrolysis, and the value of C offsets. Corn fodder at a net cost of $ 26  Mg− 1 feedstock showed a moderate potential for economic viability compared to <b>forest</b> <b>residue.</b>|$|R

25|$|Biomass is {{biological}} material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass. As an energy source, biomass {{can either be}} used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel {{can be achieved by}} different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include <b>forest</b> <b>residues</b> – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps –, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).|$|E

40|$|Harvesting branches, stumps and unmercantable tops, in {{addition}} to stem wood, decreases the carbon input to the soil and consequently reduces the forest carbon stock. We examine {{the changes in the}} forest carbon cycle that would compensate for this carbon loss over a rotation period and lead to carbon neutral <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> bioenergy systems. In addition, we analyse the potential climate impact of these carbon neutral systems. In a boreal forest, the carbon loss was compensated for with a 10 % increase in tree growth or a postponing of final felling for 20 years from 90 to 110 years in one forest rotation period. However, these changes in carbon sequestration did not prevent soil carbon loss. To recover soil carbon stock, a 38 % increase in tree growth or a 21 % decrease in the decomposition rate of the remaining organic matter was needed. All the <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> bioenergy scenarios studied had a warming impact on climate for at least 62 years. Nevertheless, the increases in the carbon sequestration from forest growth or reduction in the decomposition rate of the remaining organic matter resulted in a 50 % smaller warming impact of forest bioenergy use or even a cooling climate impact in the long term.

In the present thesis, both experimental and numerical approaches were applied to investigate the behavior of biomass gasification at high temperature and high heating rate conditions. Devolatilization of biomass and conversion of solid char are two most important steps in the gasification process. In order to assess the behavior of the rapid devolatilization of biomass, biomass particles (<b>forest</b> <b>residue,</b> torrefied <b>forest</b> <b>residue,</b> Norwegian spruce, and torrefied Norwegian spruce) were subjected to devolatilization experiments at 1073 K and 1473 K in an electrical heated drop tube reactor (DTR). A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation with a proposed two-competing rate devolatilization model was also performed and compared to the experimental results. The conversion behavior of <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> char and torrefied <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> char were further examined under oxidation and gasification conditions at 1473 K and 1573 K in the same DTR. The morphological analysis of the parent biomass and corresponding char were showed. In addition, time-resolved data on compositional transformation of the biomass and char were presented based on the metal tracer technics. In parallel, Eulerian–Lagrangian CFD models were developed to study the overall gasification process in two types of reactors: entrained-flow reactor (EFR) and fluidized-bed reactor (FBR). Comprehensive CFD simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of biomass gasification in an EFR operating at 1273 - 1673 K. The model was validated against a wide range of experimental data. Several influential factors including reactor temperature, steam/carbon molar ratio, excess air ratio, biomass type, and particle size were discussed. Regarding the FBR, particle flow pattern, bed expansion, bed pressure drop and fluctuation frequency were compared by using three different well-known inter-phase drag force correlations in a non-reactive condition. Steam gasification in FBRs was analyzed by the CFD model developed from a non-reactive study. Both qualitative and quantitative results were presented to reveal the effects of reactor temperature, steam/biomass ratio, and biomass injection position on gasification of biomass...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{bioenergy}} {{production from}} <b>forest</b> harvest <b>residues</b> decreases litter input {{to the soil}} and can thus reduce the carbon stock and sink of forests. This effect may negate greenhouse gas savings obtained by using bioenergy. We used a spatially explicit modelling framework to assess {{the reduction in the}} forest litter and soil carbon stocks across Europe, assuming that a sustainable potential of bioenergy from <b>forest</b> harvest <b>residues</b> is taken into use. The <b>forest</b> harvest <b>residue</b> removal reduced the carbon stocks of litter and soil on average by 3 % over the period from 2016 to 2100. The reduction was small compared {{to the size of the}} carbon stocks but significant in comparison to the amount of energy produced from the residues. As a result of these land-use-related missions, bioenergy production from <b>forest</b> harvest <b>residues</b> would need to be continued for 60 - 80 years to achieve a 60 % carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission reduction in heat and power generation compared to the fossil fuels it replaces in most European countries. The emission reductions achieved and their timings varied among countries because of differences in the litter and soil carbon loss. Our results show that extending the current sustainability requirements for bioliquids and biofuels to solid bioenergy does not guarantee efficient reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term. In the longer-term, bioenergy from <b>forest</b> harvest <b>residues</b> may pave the way to low-emission energy systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of variation of the moisture content of <b>forest</b> biomass <b>residues</b> on a supply chain strategy, a simulation was performed using integrated biomass supply analysis and logistics modeling. A simple supply chain strategy was chosen and applied for Miramichi and Plaster Rock, two different regions in New Brunswick, Canada. These regions are selected based on three criteria: annual potential harvest of <b>forest</b> biomass <b>residues,</b> annual production potential of electric and thermal energy and distribution of transportation zones. The moisture content of <b>forest</b> biomass <b>residues</b> was dependant on the weather conditions of the selected regions. The {{results show that the}} moisture content of the biomass in Plaster Rock was more stable but higher than the biomass in the Miramichi region. In simulating the supply chain strategy, particular attention is given to harvest, baling, storage and transportation of the biomass. The simulation results show that, during harvest and baling of the biomass, the moisture content affects the dry matter loss and, as a consequence, the customer and ownership costs of the operations. It also affects the energy input and the quantity of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} monetizing the life cycle environmental and health externalities associated with production of ethanol from corn, corn stover, switchgrass, and <b>forest</b> <b>residue.</b> The {{results of this study}} reveal current average external costs for the production of 1 Â l of ethanol ranged from $ 0. 07 for <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> to $ 0. 57 for ethanol production from corn. Among the various feedstocks, the external costs of PM 10, NOX, and PM 2. 5 are among the greatest contributors to these costs. The combustion of fossil fuels in upstream fertilizer and energy production processes is the primary source of these emissions and their costs, especially for corn ethanol. The combined costs of emissions associated with the production and use of nitrogen fertilizer also contribute substantially to the net external costs. For cellulosic ethanol production, the combustion of waste lignin to generate heat and power helps to keep the external costs lower than corn ethanol. Credits both for the biogenic carbon combustion and displacement of grid electricity by exporting excess electricity substantially negate many of the emissions and external costs. External costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions were not significant. However, adding estimates of indirect GHG emissions from land use changes would nearly double corn ethanol cost estimates. External cost Ethanol Biofuel Life cycle...|$|R

40|$|<b>Forest</b> harvest <b>residues</b> {{are often}} {{available}} at roadside landings as {{a byproduct of}} the log manufacturing process. This residue is usually available for renewable energy production if desired, however {{there is a significant}} amount of residues that do not reach the landing during the harvesting process that could potentially increase the supply of forest biomass from each harvest unit. The proportion of recoverable residues depends on their collection costs which are a function of the distance from roadside landing, terrain conditions, and collection method as well as subsequent truck transportation costs. Residues close to landings and nearest to the processing center will usually have the lowest delivered costs. Tradeoffs between increasing truck transportation costs and increasing collection costs affect which residues will be collected to reach a supply target or residue payment price. A <b>forest</b> <b>residue</b> collection model using forwarders and excavator loaders is presented to estimate the potential cost of biomass extraction from the forest to roadside landings. Tradeoffs between increasing collection costs and increasing road transportation are examined. The impact of tax credits and site preparation savings are discussed.

As distance from landing increases, one excavator loading one forwarder becomes more efficient, and at long distances, one excavator loading two forwarders becomes more efficient.
