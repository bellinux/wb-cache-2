5|$|In mid-1961, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam {{asked the}} United States to conduct aerial <b>herbicide</b> {{spraying}} in his country. In August of that year, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted <b>herbicide</b> operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy {{debate in the}} White House and the State and Defense Departments. However, U.S. officials considered using it, {{pointing out that the}} British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy authorized the start of Operation Ranch Hand, the codename for the U.S. Air Force's <b>herbicide</b> program in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{advances}} in genetic engineering led to developments in crops. Genetically modified crops introduce new traits to plants {{which they do}} not have naturally. These can bring benefits such as a decrease in the use of harmful pesticides, by building in qualities such as insect resistance and <b>herbicide</b> tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Weed {{resistance}} to <b>herbicides</b> {{has become a}} major concern in crop production worldwide. Resistance to <b>herbicides</b> is often attributed to lack of rotational programmes of <b>herbicides</b> and to continuous applications of <b>herbicides</b> with the same sites of action. Thus, a true understanding of the sites of action of <b>herbicides</b> is essential for strategic planning of herbicide-based weed control.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the primary}} methods of weed control in the Christmas tree farming {{industry}} is {{through the use of}} chemical <b>herbicides.</b> The use of <b>herbicides</b> and other pesticides {{is one of the key}} reasons Christmas tree farms have met with opposition from environmentalists. In applying <b>herbicides</b> growers must determine proper spray volume and timing. There are different types of <b>herbicides</b> that are used to control different types of weeds, they fall into two different categories. Soil applied <b>herbicides</b> combat germinating seedlings, and some offer control of newly established plants. Uniform application over the soil followed by moisture are required for soil applied <b>herbicides</b> to work effectively. Foilar-active <b>herbicides</b> control weed growth of already established, actively growing plants. Application of foliar-active <b>herbicides</b> requires farmers to avoid contact with the conifers.|$|R
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportDemonstrations of banded <b>herbicides</b> and {{cultivation}} {{were conducted}} at three locations in New York. Despite extensive on-station {{research showing that}} banded <b>herbicides</b> and cultivation can result in yields equivalent to broadcast <b>herbicides,</b> even growers who already cultivate rarely use banding of <b>herbicides</b> to reduce chemical application rates and costs...|$|R
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the <b>herbicide</b> prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|Agent Orange was to {{a lesser}} extent used outside Vietnam. Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia was also sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the Vietcong. Some countries, such as Canada, saw testing, while other countries, such as Brazil, used the <b>herbicide</b> to clear out sections of land for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate <b>herbicide</b> Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed. Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer {{from using the}} seeds {{for more than a}} single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} {{controlling}} Parrots feather {{is by the}} usage of <b>herbicides.</b> The <b>herbicides</b> are effective to the plant part exposed above water. The plant parts beneath the water never come fully {{into contact with the}} pesticides and are therefore washed away. <b>Herbicides</b> are most effective when applied to young growing plants. They should be applied repeatedly to show maximum results. M. aquaticum is more difficult to control with <b>herbicides</b> than other aquatic species. The leaves are protected by a thick waxy coating, and in order for <b>herbicides</b> to penetrate the leaves, surfactants must be added; however, <b>herbicides</b> may impact non-target native plants or animals.|$|R
40|$|ACCase-resistant Italian {{ryegrass}} (Lolium multiflorum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} troublesome weeds in US wheat production systems. This study had the objective of determining the resistance pattern of three subpopulations selected from a winter wheat field with history of ACCase-inhibitor <b>herbicides</b> applications in Oregon. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to test four ACCase-inhibitor <b>herbicides</b> for the control of the three sub-populations: Pinoxaden, clethodim, sethoxydim and clodinafop. All three sub-populations were cross-resistant to the commercial dose of at least two <b>herbicides.</b> One sub-population was cross-resistant to all <b>herbicides</b> tested. This resistance pattern highlights the need of studying different ACCase <b>herbicides</b> for crossresistance, as well as <b>herbicides</b> with different modes of action for multiple-resistance to control these subpopulations...|$|R
40|$|Pesticides (<b>herbicides</b> and insecticides) {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the White River Basin. Appli-cation of <b>herbicides</b> to corn and soybeans accounts {{for most of the}} use. The pesticides most frequently detected near the mouth of the White River during 1991 - 95 were the <b>herbicides</b> alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, and metolachlor. The highest concentrations of <b>herbicides</b> in the river were typically found during late spring runoff following application. Generally, con-centrations of alachlor have been decreasing while concentrations of acetochlor have been increasing in response to changes in the use of these <b>herbicides</b> in the basin. The total amount of the commonly used <b>herbicides</b> transported by the river is about 1 percent or less of the amount applied to cropland. Insecticides commonly used in urban and agricultural areas also were found but in much lower concentrations than commonly used <b>herbicides...</b>|$|R
5|$|TCDD is {{the most}} potent {{compound}} (congener) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in Agent Orange, a <b>herbicide</b> used in the Vietnam War. TCDD was released into the environment in the Seveso disaster. It is a persistent environmental contaminant usually present in a complex mixture of dioxin-like compounds, and is a carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public {{was not made}} aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all <b>herbicide</b> spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E
5|$|The <b>herbicide</b> {{glyphosate}} is an inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, other herbicides, {{such as the}} sulfonylureas {{inhibit the}} enzyme acetolactate synthase. Both these enzymes are needed for plants to make branched-chain amino acids. Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
40|$|The method {{presented}} uses a mixed-mode {{anion exchange}} SPE and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to analyze 5 sulfonylurea, 8 phenoxy acid, 12 triazine and 6 other <b>herbicides</b> in environmental waters. The mixed-mode SPE cartridge {{is able to}} retain {{a wide range of}} <b>herbicides</b> with acidic-neutral-basic characteristics, particularly the highly polar and acidic compounds clopyralid, dicamba and picloram. The neutral and basic <b>herbicides</b> can be effectively eluted with methanol, after which the acidic <b>herbicides</b> can be eluted using acidified methanol. The method has achieved an LOD of 0. 7 - 3. ng/L for the sulfonylureas, 4 - 12. ng/L for the phenoxy acids and 0. 4 - 30. ng/L for the triazine and additional <b>herbicides,</b> with recoveries in the range 76 - 107 %, 73 - 126 %, and 65 - 104 %, respectively. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), was below 10 % for both sulfonylurea and phenoxy acid <b>herbicides,</b> and less than 20 % for the remaining <b>herbicides.</b> The developed method was used to determine the concentration of target <b>herbicides</b> in a range of environmental waters, and many of the target <b>herbicides</b> were detected at ng/L level...|$|R

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and <b>herbicide</b> resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{diseases}} are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and <b>herbicide</b> resistance. It is possible that we are facing {{the end of the}} effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and <b>herbicide,</b> but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
40|$|Twenty three <b>herbicides</b> {{including}} the current registered <b>herbicides</b> were screened for activity on pre-emergent, juvenile and mature plants of the weedy Sporobolus grass species Sporobolus pyramidalis P. Beauv. and Sporobolus fertilis (Steud.) Clayton. No new <b>herbicides</b> trialled effectively controlled mature plants. Propaquizafop, fluazifop-P-hutyI, flupropanate, haloxyfop-R-methyl ester, glyphosate-ipa and clethodim + haloxyfop-R-methyl ester mix showed good activity on juvenile plants while atrazine, flupropanate, dithiopyr and imazapyr where effective as pre-emergent <b>herbicides.</b> Further work {{needs to be}} done to define the recommended application rates for juvenile and pre-emergent plant stages and to determine the selectivity of these <b>herbicides</b> on native and exotic pasture grasses...|$|R

50|$|Work on {{military}} <b>herbicides</b> began in England in 1940, and by 1944, the United States {{joined in the}} effort. Even though <b>herbicides</b> are chemicals, due to their mechanism of action (growth regulators), they are often considered a means of biological warfare. Over 1,000 substances were investigated by the war's end for phytotoxic properties, and the Allies envisioned using <b>herbicides</b> to destroy Axis crops. British planners did not believe <b>herbicides</b> were logistically feasible against Germany.|$|R
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater <b>herbicide</b> tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, <b>herbicide</b> use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to {{at least some of}} the decline in numbers, but the relative importance of the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an <b>herbicide</b> on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|However {{weed control}} {{can also be}} {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} <b>herbicides.</b> Selective <b>herbicides</b> kill certain targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones. <b>Herbicides</b> are generally classified as follows: ...|$|R
40|$|Results of five {{experiments}} {{conducted to}} assess the sensitivity of some South African sugarcane varieties to <b>herbicides</b> are reported. Most of the <b>herbicides</b> and varieties used commonly were tested in the experiments, which form part of a continuing programme of evaluation of new <b>herbicides</b> and varieties, NCo 376 was included in all experiments {{for the purpose of}} comparison. <b>Herbicides</b> were applied either at the standard rate or twice the standard rate to sugarcane foliage. Marked differences in variety sensitivity were apparent, stalk heights, stalk populations and yields being reduced due to treatment with <b>herbicides.</b> Reductions of yield were severe in pot experiments but were considerably less in field experiments. In general, if <b>herbicides</b> are applied at the correct rates and in the correct manner, no commercially important yield reductions should occur...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the sorption of Ametryn, Atrazine, Simazine, Prometrine and Metamitron to soils from ?Mata Atlântica? at Ubatuba region (Atlantic rainforest soils), employing the batch equilibrium approach. The <b>herbicides</b> were weakly retained in soils with low soil organic matter (SOM) content and thus presenting high potential to water contamination. All <b>herbicides</b> have shown high Koc at Typic Humaquepts soil, the higher in SOM content. The sorption isotherms for the <b>herbicides</b> at Typic Humaquepts soil suggested specific interactions between <b>herbicides</b> and SOM probably with partial protonation of <b>herbicides</b> followed by ion-exchange processes and/or hydrogen bonding formation of hydroxyl groups on the SOM surface. 200...|$|R
25|$|The use of GMO {{crop plants}} {{engineered}} for <b>herbicide</b> resistance can also indirectly {{increase the amount}} of agricultural pollution associated with <b>herbicide</b> use. For example, the increased use of <b>herbicide</b> in herbicide-resistant corn fields in the mid-western United States is decreasing the amount of milkweeds available for monarch butterfly larvae.|$|E
25|$|Crops {{have been}} commercialized that are {{resistant}} to the <b>herbicide</b> glufosinate, as well. Crops engineered for resistance to multiple herbicides to allow farmers to use a mixed group of two, three, or four different chemicals are under development to combat growing <b>herbicide</b> resistance.|$|E

50|$|Plants have {{developed}} resistance to atrazine and to ALS-inhibitors, and more recently, to glyphosate <b>herbicides.</b> Marestail is one weed {{that has developed}} glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate-resistant weeds {{are present in the}} vast majority of soybean, cotton and corn farms in some U.S. states. Weeds that can resist multiple other <b>herbicides</b> are spreading. Few new <b>herbicides</b> are near commercialization, and none with a molecular mode of action for which there is no resistance. Because most <b>herbicides</b> could not kill all weeds, farmers rotated crops and <b>herbicides</b> to stop resistant weeds. During its initial years, glyphosate was not subject to resistance and allowed farmers to reduce the use of rotation.|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>herbicides</b> used in agriculture {{is influenced by}} their chemical stability, solubility, bioavailability, photodecomposition, and soil sorption. Possible solutions designed to minimize toxicity include the development of carrier systems able to modify {{the properties of the}} compounds and allow their controlled release. Polymeric poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocapsules containing three triazine <b>herbicides</b> (ametryn, atrazine, and simazine) were prepared and characterized in order to assess their suitability as controlled release systems that could reduce environmental impacts. The association efficiencies of the <b>herbicides</b> in the nanocapsules were better than 84 %. Assessment of stability (considering particle diameter, zeta potential, polydispersity, and pH) was conducted over a period of 270 days, and the particles were found to be stable in solution. In vitro release kinetics experiments revealed controlled release of the <b>herbicides</b> from the nanocapsules, governed mainly by relaxation of the polymer chains. Microscopy analyses showed that the nanocapsules were spherical, dense, and without aggregates. In the infrared spectra of the PCL nanocapsules containing <b>herbicides,</b> there were no bands related to the <b>herbicides,</b> indicating that interactions between the compounds had occurred. Genotoxicity tests showed that formulations of nanocapsules containing the <b>herbicides</b> were less toxic than the free <b>herbicides.</b> The results indicate that the use of PCL nanocapsules is a promising technique that could improve the behavior of <b>herbicides</b> in environmental systems.
