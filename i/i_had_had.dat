25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
500|$|After 1974, Harrison {{no longer}} wrote songs as {{obviously}} Krishna-devotional as [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)", although {{he returned to}} recording bhajans intermittently, with songs such as [...] "Dear One" [...] in 1976 and [...] "Life Itself, released in 1981. In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the [...] "ill-fated 1974 tour", Harrison [...] "continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface". Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, whatever we were all getting into, we tended to broadcast it as loud as we could. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody.

The “sober reality” was twelve to fourteen hours of dreary, exhausting work, which many workers experienced as hostile to intellectual development.|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E
500|$|In 1677, a {{particularly}} brutal German General Kops leading {{the forces of}} Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I designed to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general for the Hungarians, , responded in kind, by flaying alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> enough of the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops {{in order to establish}} a needed cessation of hostilities. After the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Sicily fell under Habsburg rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming it was gone a whole eight days since last he killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled. [...] In the short-lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of Horea's 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: [...] "There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will.... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude." [...] L. Tom Perry described: [...] "I felt something like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley later said: [...] "For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{prolific}} {{during his}} short career, and {{now one of}} the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, [...] "I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> time I would have made myself remember'd.

2500|$|That {{story had}} {{its origins in}} Price's enthusiasm for an earlier Lovecraft tale. [...] "One of my {{favorite}} HPL stories was, and still is, 'The Silver Key'," [...] Price wrote in a 1944 memoir. [...] "In telling him of the pleasure <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> in rereading it, I suggested a sequel to account for protagonist Randolph Carter's doings after his disappearance." [...] After convincing an apparently reluctant Lovecraft to collaborate on such a sequel, Price wrote a 6,000-word draft in August 1932; in April 1933, Lovecraft produced a 14,000-word version that left unchanged, by Price's estimate, [...] "fewer than fifty of my original words," [...] though An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia reports that Lovecraft [...] "kept as many of Price's conceptions as possible, {{as well as some}} of his language." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later this {{affinity}} for Great Britain prompted Buechner to make frequent sojourns and {{visits to the}} United Kingdom. [...] He cultivated profound, enduring, and mutually supportive relationships with prominent Britons. [...] He spoke regularly at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury and was friendly with former deans, The Very Rev. Michael Mayne (Westminster) and The Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson (Salisbury). In fact, his most recent collection, The Yellow Leaves, was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Michael Mayne and, with love, to his wife Allison. [...] In that work, Buechner expresses [...] "the feeling that from the beginning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> in England that in some sense I had come home, the feeling I had always had, in Westminster Abbey especially, that all the dead past enshrined there was far from dead in me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bilge Khagan also {{references}} {{the hiring}} of Chinese artists when he claims, [...] "From the Chinese Emperor <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> artists to come, and <b>have</b> set them to work.

They <b>have</b> sent the Chinese Emperor's court painters. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> bidden them set up a separate hall, and inside and out <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> them to make various paintings. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the stone hewn; that which lay in my heart to utter <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> Understand to see this all {{as far as the}} suns and subjects of the Ten Arrows. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the memorial stone hewn." [...] To further complicate the already muddled view of the Chinese, the inscriptions contain both Turkic and Chinese translations. Thus, the inscription contains evidence that Bilge Khagan <b>had</b> cultural interaction with the Tang dynasty.|$|R

2500|$|Hitler {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933. He dismissed it as [...] "fantasies behind bars" [...] that were little more than a series of articles for the Völkischer Beobachter, and later told Hans Frank that [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> any idea in 1924 that I would have become Reich chancellor, I never would have written the book." [...] Nevertheless, Mein Kampf was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s. During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front. [...] By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages. By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Foster enjoys {{spending}} time with Amy's fourteen-year-old brother, who visits for Amy's wedding to Pearson, calling him [...] "a tonic breeze." [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a boy, I should have wanted him just like Dick," [...] Joe tells himself.(268) Mrs. Phillips is eager to see Amy off so she can invite Cope once more. She and Randolph discuss their somewhat competitive attempts to gain Cope's attention. She calls Arthur [...] "an uncertain quantity."(271) Cope joins another Duneland weekend while Arthur, now cast in an important female role in the Dramatic Society's next presentation, rehearses. Mrs. Phillips explains that good taste requires a man who plays a female role to avoid too perfect an impersonation. Cope alerts the house to a late-night burglar and is praised as a hero though he only raised the alarm, while a servant chased the burglar off. Cope knows the role he played, but Mrs. Phillips and Carolyn convince themselves he played the hero's part.|$|E
2500|$|Within the Government doubts quickly {{began to}} be voiced about the justice of his treatment. [...] Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, Baldwin, wrote letters admitting that their {{decision}} had been wrong. As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote [...] "I feel it only right to say that, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did". Writing in November 1937, Lord Hankey stated [...] "the more I think about it the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime". In December 1938, the Marquess of Londonderry – the Secretary of State for Air {{at the time of}} the dismissal – wrote privately to Baldwin [...] "... was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant Sir Warren Fisher who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{passages}} {{are open}} to multiple readings. For example, after Cope swims vigorously and Randolph joins him to bob in the water, the narrator says: [...] "Ceremonially, at least, the rite was complete." [...] Something implied but unspecified did not occur. Cope later recalls his day: [...] "He had had a good swim, if but a brief one, with a companion who had been willing, even if not bold." [...] The action that Randolph was willing but not bold enough to undertake is not specified. Hortense, once she realizes Cope {{has no interest in}} her or the other girls, warns him against Arthur, revealing that she sees the relationship Cope maintains with Arthur as an alternative, in some sense equivalent, to a heterosexual engagement. In an age when literary convention respected intense male relationships, she labels this one [...] "that preposterous friendship." [...] Of a fourteen-year-old boy who has provided entertaining companionship, Joe muses: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a boy, I should have wanted him just like Dick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."

When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
