5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E
5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial <b>issue,</b> <b>because</b> some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event, perhaps less than ten thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin first {{appeared}} as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run {{for only a few}} weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an <b>issue.</b> <b>Because</b> of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable <b>issue.</b> <b>Because</b> of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E

25|$|Acid {{rain has}} become an <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> it is {{damaging}} soils and lakes and polluting the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The HBV hydrology transport model {{has been used to}} analyze nutrient discharge to the Baltic from tributary watersheds.|$|E
25|$|Access to the East Campus {{site was}} an <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> of the steep grade {{elevating}} it above the city. The Western State Normal Railroad {{was established in}} 1907 to carry students and staff {{up and down the}} hill via a funicular. It operated until 1949.|$|E
25|$|The {{stress in}} other words seems to be variable, {{but this is not}} a serious <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> most of these words are only one {{syllable}} in length. There are some words which should fall under the rules above, but do not, although using the standard rules would still be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|While {{the number}} of Non-governmental Organization have {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades, fragmentation in aid policy is an <b>issue.</b> <b>Because</b> of such fragmentation, health workers in several African countries, for example, say they are so busy meeting western delegates that they can only do their proper jobs in the evening.|$|E
25|$|The Serb {{minority}} of Kosovo, which largely opposes {{the declaration of}} independence, has formed the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> it will not have an operative role.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 Kenya and Ethiopia reaffirmed their boundary, {{confirming}} Kenyan sovereignty to Namuruputh, {{which is}} {{just south of the}} southeastern point of the triangle. In 1972 a Sudan-Ethiopia boundary alteration did not solve the Ilemi <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> it did not involve Kenya, but did confirm that Ethiopia had no claim to the Ilemi Triangle.|$|E

25|$|Pseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if {{generally}} benign, {{are used}} by charlatans. This poses a serious <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> it enables incompetent practitioners to administer health care. True-believing zealots may pose a more serious threat than typical con men because of their affection to homeopathy's ideology. Irrational health care is not harmless, and it is careless to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine.|$|E
25|$|The local media, {{especially}} the daily tabloid The New Paper, began to sensationalise homosexual activities with attention-grabbing headlines like 'Pool Perverts on the Loose' and 'Gays surface again at East Coast beach'. In 1992, the Censorship Review Committee recommended that 'materials encouraging homosexuality {{should continue to}} be disallowed.' In 1996, I-S Magazines publishing license was suspended for one <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> of gay content appearing in the personal ads section.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} {{responsible for}} SKY Network Television, a New Zealand pay TV company, failed {{the day after}} this eclipse at around 1900 local time. While SKY didn't directly attribute the failure to the eclipse, they said in a media release that it took longer to resolve the <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> of it, but this claim was refuted by astronomers. The main reason for the failure was because of an aging and increasingly faulty satellite.|$|E

25|$|Not all authors {{reconstruct}} the same sets of endings. Some endings {{are difficult to}} reconstruct. For example, the original form of the genitive plural is a particular thorny <b>issue,</b> <b>because</b> different daughter languages appear to reflect different proto-forms. It is variously reconstructed as , etc. Meanwhile, the dual endings of cases other than the merged nominative/vocative/accusative are often considered impossible to reconstruct because these endings are attested sparsely and diverge radically in different languages.|$|E
25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children do. This is a contentious <b>issue</b> <b>because</b> of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E
25|$|At the Moscow Conference {{of foreign}} {{ministers of the}} three Allied great powers (October 1943), {{at the request of}} the Polish {{government}} borders were not discussed, but US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had already expressed his support for Britain's approval of the Curzon Line as the future Polish-Soviet boundary. The powers represented divided Europe into spheres of influence and Poland was placed within the Soviet sphere. The Poles were also disappointed by a lack of progress regarding the resumption of Polish-Soviet diplomatic ties, an urgent <b>issue,</b> <b>because</b> the Soviet armies were moving toward Poland's 1939 frontiers.|$|E
