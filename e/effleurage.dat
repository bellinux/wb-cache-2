50|$|<b>Effleurage</b> and {{friction}} {{are both}} good techniques in massaging cats. After the cat has shown it is relaxed, the owners may start to pet {{it from the}} head to the tail, by using their open and relaxed hand. This is the <b>effleurage</b> technique. While practicing this movement, owners can look for abnormalities such as lumps or bumps. The <b>effleurage</b> stroke is helpful in stimulating blood circulation and warming up the tissue. Circular friction may be performed down the cat's body by using one's fingertip to draw small circles on its skin, including the tail.|$|E

5000|$|AD 1878: Dutch massage {{practitioner}} Johan Georg Mezger applies French {{terms to}} name five basic massage techniques, and coins the phrase [...] "Swedish massage system". These techniques are still known by their French names (<b>effleurage</b> (long, gliding strokes), petrissage (lifting and kneading the muscles), friction (firm, deep, circular rubbing movements), tapotement (brisk tapping or percussive movements), and vibration (rapidly shaking or vibrating specific muscles)).|$|E

5000|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} and commonly used category of massage is the Swedish massage. The Swedish massage techniques vary from light to vigorous. Swedish massage uses five styles of strokes. The five basic strokes are <b>effleurage</b> (sliding or gliding), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction (cross fiber {{or with the}} fibers) and vibration/shaking. Swedish massage has shown to be helpful in reducing pain, joint stiffness, and improving function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee {{over a period of}} eight weeks. [...] The development of Swedish massage is often inaccurately credited to Per Henrik Ling, though the Dutch practitioner Johann Georg Mezger applied the French terms to name the basic strokes. The term [...] "Swedish" [...] massage is actually only recognized in English and Dutch speaking countries, and in Hungary. Elsewhere the style is referred to as [...] "classic massage".|$|E
5000|$|The same {{strokes and}} {{techniques}} used in human massage are practiced in canine massage {{for the same}} reasons. There are seven main strokes used in Swedish Massage - <b>effleurage,</b> petrissage, friction, tapotement, and vibration. Swedish massage also utilizes a variety of stretching techniques and range of motion movements (R.O.M.) Each of the Swedish Massage strokes have subdivisions of the strokes which are modifications of the basic stroke to style, speed and depth. Acupressure which is a catch all term for some forms of Asian bodywork techniques like Tui-Na, Shiatsu, Do-In, Anma, Hoshino Therapy, Jamu, Jin Shin Do, Nuad Bo Rarn, and Qi Gong Meridian Therapy {{to name just a}} few. Tellington Touch, Myofascial Release, Positional Release, Reflexology, Watsu, Trigger Point Therapy, Orthobionomy, various Osteopathic techniques just to name a few. Within each modality or massage technique there are manual manipulations that are sometimes but not always unique to the modality. Many of the multitude of massage techniques share some of the same basic strokes but the application of these strokes may vary slightly depending on the intent of the stroke and the practitioners skill level. For instance Tellington Touch currently has twenty five massage manipulations and Linda Tellington is adding new touches from time to time. Each one of these touches is designed to have specific effects on the physiological, mental, energetic, emotional and spiritual systems of the animal. Tui-Na has five different named manipulations, seventeen subdivisions of the basic five and four special manipulations for the passive movement of the joints. The five basic Tui-Na manipulations are Bai Dong Fa (swinging), Mo Ca Fa (friction), Ji Ya Fa (squeezing), Zhen Dong Fa (trembling) and Kou Ji Fa (percussing). The subdivisions of each main manipulation are: 1. Bai Dong Fa (swinging): Yi-zhi-chan (single thumb), Gun-fa (rolling) and Rou-fa (rotary-kneading. 2.Mo Ca Fa (friction): Mo-fa (touching skin and muscle) Ca-fa (rubbing), Tui-fa (pushing), Cuo-fa (kneading) and Moo-fa (daubing/massaging) 3.Ji Ya Fa (squeezing): An-fa (pressing), Dian-fa (knocking), Nie-fa (pinching), Na-fa (pulling) and Nian-fa (holding-kneading) 4.Zhen Dong Fa (trembling): Dou-fa (shaking) and Zhen-fa (vibrating) 5. Kou Ji Fa (percussing): Pai-fa (patting) and Ji-fa (beating). The four special manipulations of Tui-Na are: 1.Yao-fa (rocking) 2.Beo-fa (carrying) 3.Ban-fa (wrenching) 4.Ba-shen-fa (stretching or drawing).|$|E

40|$|Background: Dysmenorrhea is pain during {{menstruation}} {{in lower}} abdomen, {{and is not}} due to other diseases. <b>Effleurage</b> massage and consuming green coconut water are considered able to reduce menstrual pain. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of the combination between the two interventions. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of <b>effleurage</b> massage and in combination with green coconut water on pain, anxiety, and Ã-endorphin level in teenage girls with menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea). Design: A quasy experiment with pretest-posttest approach design with control group. There were 36 samples recruited in this study by purposive sampling, which were divided into a massage therapy group, the combination therapy group, and a control group. Menstrual pain was measured using Numeric Rating Scale, while anxiety was measured using Zung Self rating Anxiety Scale (ZSAS), and endorphin level using ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). One way anova test and repeated anova were performed as a bivariate analysis. Mancova and post hoc anova were used for multivariate analysis. Result: The combination of massage and green coconut water was more effective in reducing pain (p 0. 013) and anxiety levels (p 0. 000), and in increasing Î²-endorphin (p 0. 029) with significant value of < 0. 05 compared to the massage therapy alone.

40|$|ABSTRACT Breast {{cancer is}} {{the most common type of}} cancer in females. The effect of massage in the field of {{oncology}} has been investigated to some extent. The present thesis explored the effect of light pressure <b>effleurage</b> massage in women with breast cancer in six main domains; nausea, anxiety, depression, quality of life, stress and cellular immunity. It also described the experience of massage during chemotherapy. 	The effect of light pressure <b>effleurage</b> was investigated on nausea, anxiety and depression in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Five part-body massage treatments were given during chemotherapy infusion. Massage significantly lowered nausea (p= 0. 025) compared with control group. No significant differences were shown between study groups on anxiety and depression. 	The experience of light pressure <b>effleurage</b> during chemotherapy treatment was studied using phenomenology as theoretical framework. The essential meaning of receiving massage during chemotherapy was described as a retreat from the feeling of uneasiness toward chemotherapy. Results revealed five themes: a distraction from the frightening experience, a turn from negative to positive, a sense of relaxation, a confirmation of caring and finally they just felt good. 	The effect of light pressure <b>effleurage</b> on immunity was investigated in women with breast cancer undergoing radiation. Ten part-body massage treatments, 20 minutes duration, were given during three weeks. Main variables were NK (Natural Killer) and T cells. The effect of massage on cortisol, oxytocin, anxiety, depression and quality of life was also studied. We were not able to demonstrate any significant differences between study groups on any of the variables in this study. 	The immediate effect of light pressure <b>effleurage</b> on immunity was also investigated. Patients received one full-body massage, 45 minutes duration. Main variable was NK cells, secondary variables cortisol, blood-pressure and heart rate. Massage treatment had significant effect on NK cell function compared with the control group (p= 0. 03). Furthermore, massage significantly lowered systolic blood-pressure (p= 0. 03) and heart rate (p= 0. 04) compared with the control group. No significant effects were demonstrated on cortisol or diastolic blood-pressure. 	In conclusion, the present thesis demonstrated that light pressure <b>effleurage</b> could be effective in reducing nausea in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. A single full-body light pressure massage had short term effects on NK cell function, it decreased heart rate and systolic blood pressure significantly compared with visit only. It appears that repeated part-body light pressure massage did not affect cellular immunity during radiation, possibly due to secondary effects of radiation on immunity. Altogether, it might be speculated that the intensity of part-body massage was too low to affect cellular immunity compared with full-body massage. Furthermore, the amount of pressure used might bear impact on results. Patients with breast cancer however, experienced light pressure massage as a retreat from uneasy, unwanted, negative feelings connected with chemotherapy treatment...|$|E

40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 10 (2) : 258 - 265, 2017. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) {{can occur}} after intense {{exercise}} and remain for several days. Massage is one {{means by which}} DOMS can be reduced; however, the timing of exercise, techniques applied, and timing of application produces differing outcomes. Purpose: To evaluate {{the effect of a}} 20 -minute Swedish massage immediately after strenuous exercise on DOMS. Procedures: Twenty college students engaged in two sets of a squatting exercise to fatigue and then the right or the left leg was immediately massaged. <b>Effleurage,</b> petrissage, friction and compression manual techniques were used for 10 minutes on the quadriceps and the 10 minutes on the hamstrings and gluteal group, so that each manual technique utilized 2. 5 minutes. Participants rated their DOMS 24 and 48 hours later with a single-digit incremental numeric rating scale. Results: Delayed onset muscle soreness in the massaged leg at 24 hours was significantly lower compared to the non-massaged leg (p =. 019, Cohenâs d =. 56), but no significant difference at 48 hours existed between the legs (p =. 097, Cohenâs d =. 49). Additionally, the increase in DOMS from 24 to 48 hours was significant in the massaged leg (p =. 043, Cohenâs d =. 83), but a significant increase between these two time points was not evident in the non-massaged leg (p =. 067, Cohenâs d =. 49). Conclusions. A 20 -minute Swedish massage immediately after squatting exercise is effective in attenuating DOMS after 24 hours...|$|E
40|$|Massage is {{commonly}} used during and between sporting events {{with the intent to}} speed recovery time and improve performance. While {{a great deal of time}} and money is allocated to physical therapists, massage therapists and athletic trainers for the application of sports massage, the research thus far is inconsistent at best in supporting the benefits and efficacy of this modality. The purpose if this study was to investigate the effects of post-exercise massage on recovery of power and torque of the quadriceps using a Biodex dynamometer. Thirty-one healthy subjects who normally engaged in a consistent exercise regimen were tested as they performed fifteen maximal concentric knee extension repetitions at an angular velocity of 90 o/second on the Biodex. Quadriceps average power and peak torque were measured with the Biodex, after which the subjects were further fatigued via isometric and plyometric exercises. Fifteen subjects then received the placebo treatment (ten-minute rest and the application of Alboleneâ¢ cream to the left quadriceps) and sixteen subjects received the massage treatment (ten-minute massage consisting of <b>effleurage</b> and petrissage to the left quadriceps). Following their respective treatments, subjects were all re-tested for average quadriceps power and peak torque with the Biodex. There was no statistically significant difference in the change of average power or peak torque between the massage and the placebo groups. It was concluded that massage may have questionable efficacy in aiding the recovery of muscular power and torque, and its use for this purpose in athletic settings should be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} complaints of persons aged 60 or over. In German geriatric hospitals every second patient suffers from pain, one third of those experience strong or maximal discomfort. With age also multimorbidity increases and often causes pain as an accompanying symptom. Multimorbidity also leads to polypharmacy which can increase the risk for adverse effects due to poorly understood drug interactions. These uncertainties in therapy often lead to undertreatment and mistreatment of pain in clinical practice. The use of non-pharmacological measures for pain reduction can decrease the incidence of adverse drug effects and optimise at the same time pain reduction for the affected persons. However, evidence for these measures is lacking with regard to certain kinds of pain and specific patient groups. Therefore a randomized controlled, single-blind prospective trial to test the effectiveness of the âAtemstimulierende Einreibungâ (ASE) as a suitable non-pharmacological intervention for pain reduction was carried out. It was set-up in a pre-test - post-test control group design. The intervention under scrutiny is a rhythmical <b>effleurage</b> used for breath therapy which aims to steady, quieten and deepen respiration. Depending on group allocation, participants either received the genuine intervention or a sham back massage twice daily for a 7 -day period. As a primary outcome indicator for effectiveness, changes of pain intensity were assessed using a numerical rating scale. For completeness indicators of affective and sensory pain perception were included in the study. Results were supplemented with the measurement of physiological parameters of relaxation (respiratory and heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) as well as information on sleep quality as secondary outcomes. Older persons with multiple diseases and painful changes in the hip were included in the study. As part of a convenience sample 40 persons took part in the study. They were on average 81 years old. 83 % were women. The effectiveness of the breath-stimulative <b>effleurage</b> was supported in the present study in various regards. Following the intervention pain intensity was lower in the intervention group than in the control group that received a sham massage. The use of the ASE led on average to a statistically significant (p = 0, 040) and clinically relevant reduction of the strongest pain of about 1. 9 points on a 11 -point scale in comparison to only 0. 5 in the control group. Over the course of the intervention phase a significant group difference was identified in support of the ASE. Pain intensity was about 0. 4 points lower than in the control group over the course of time. ASE leads to a 25 % decrease in pain. Also the interference of pain with âgeneral activitiesâ and âwalking abilityâ was significantly reduced by the ASE. Additionally ASE clearly enhanced relaxation better than the sham massage as demonstrated by the physiological parameters. On average ASE reduced the respiratory rate by 30 %, heart rate by 29 %, systolic blood pressure by 33 % and diastolic blood pressure by 48 %. Sleep quality was not improved by the intervention, though. Nevertheless it consistently remained at the same level demonstrated prior to the intervention. The results support the assumption that the ASE as a non-pharmacological intervention can reduce pain, supplementing pharmacological treatment. Thus it can be characterised as a suitable intervention for pain reduction for older persons with multiple illnesses and painful changes in the hip. Nevertheless, to generally accept the ASE into clinical nursing practise for older persons, more research is needed...|$|E
40|$|Haakana, Piia 2008. The acute {{effects of}} massage on muscle tone and {{perceived}} recovery. Department of biology of physical activity, University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤. Bachelorâs thesis. 47 pp. The physiological effects of massage have been controversial in previous studies. There is one previous study on effects of massage on muscle tone {{but there were}} no effects during one month intervention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the correlations between subcutaneous tissue and rectus femoris muscle thickness and muscle tone. The differences on muscle tone between groups that received massage immediately or one day after the resistance training were examined. The effects of massage on perceived recovery were monitored immediately and day after massage. Ten subjects completed the study, five in each group. The thickness of subcutaneous and muscle tissue, and pennation angle was measured from rectus femoris muscle prior to the training session. Both groups had the same pre measurements and training session, with three sets at 70 % of 1 RM squat until exhaustion on a Smith machine. Muscle tone was measured before and after the training and massage sessions, and a day after massage. Subjects filled in questionnaires of their state of perceived recovery each time the muscle tone was measured after the training. Massage was applied for group 1 immediately after the training and for group 2 one day after the training. Massage, 10 minutes per leg, was performed with <b>effleurage</b> and petrissage techniques by the same therapist for each subject. A significant decrease in muscle tone was found in group 1 immediately after training. Following massage the tone increased. There was no effect of training or massage on group 2. This might be due lack of subjects and the control group, insufficient training session, incapability of subjects to totally relax during the muscle tone measurement or other factors such as elevated muscle tone due to activities prior to the measurements...|$|E
40|$|Obstetrical {{patients}} often {{present in}} labor {{with little or}} no knowledge of how to manage the pain of labor before pharmacological means are available. This may lead to increased discomfort during labor and an overall decrease in the satisfaction of the birthing experience. A recommended intervention for improving pain outcomes and satisfaction in the birthing experience is antenatal patient education on nonpharmacological techniques to decrease pain and increase satisfaction during the birthing experience. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effects of antenatal education of non-pharmacological techniques on patient pain during labor and satisfaction with the delivery experience. The Gate Control Theory of Pain will be used as the theoretical framework for this quasi-experimental study. According to Melzack & Wall (1982) the Gate-Control Theory predicts that massaging a particular area stimulates large diameter nerve fibres. These fibres have an inhibitory input onto T cells and the T cells are depressed. Nociceptive fibres have an excitatory input effect, which is, therefore, followed by pain relief. Nonpharmocologic pain relief measure such as <b>effleurage,</b> massage, cold/hot application etc. would then, in theory, work to decrease pain in the laboring patient. The sample will include 100 primaparas women randomly, alternately selected from an accessible population of physician offices of four Texas Health Resource (THR) hospitals located in North Texas. Inclusion in the study will consist of the ability of the participants to read and write English, primaparity, and planned spontaneous vaginal delivery. Patients will receive an invitation to participate in the study by the physician during an antenatal clinic visit. A cover letter explaining the study outlining the voluntary nature of the study will be given to all expectant patients by the physician. Informed consent will be signed. Responses collected will be confidential and the data will remain anonymous. No risks have been identified. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. Women will then be divided into a control group, which will have no formal instruction on non-pharmacological techniques pain control techniques, and an experimental group, which will have formal instruction on non-pharmacological pain control techniques. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), which measures perceptions of pain and Visual Analog Scales will be used to evaluate pain during the birthing process. The Coping with Childbirth Questionnaire and the Childbirth Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used to evaluate overall satisfaction with the delivery experience. The significance of this study will be to show that if primaparous women attend antenatal classes to learn to effectively use non-pharmacological pain relief measures, they may be able to benefit by having a decrease in labor pain and an increase in the satisfaction with the delivery experience.
