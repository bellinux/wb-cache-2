5|$|The Witness is a 3D puzzle {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Thekla, Inc. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in January 2016, and later for Xbox One, Nvidia Shield, macOS, and iOS. Inspired by Myst, the game involves the exploration of an open world island filled with natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by solving puzzles, {{which are based on}} interactions with mazes presented on panels around the island or hidden within the environment. The player will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the rules of each puzzle from visual clues and audio recordings scattered around the island.|$|E

25|$|Hong Kong’s University Grants Committee {{adopted an}} outcomes-based {{approach}} to teaching and learning in 2005. No specific approach was created leaving universities to design the approach themselves. Universities were also left with a goal of ensuring an education for their students that will contribute to social and economic development, {{as defined by the}} community in which the university resides. With little to no direction or feedback from the outside universities will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if their approach is achieving its goals on their own.|$|E
25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E
25|$|Art {{certainly}} cannot advance under {{compulsion to}} traditional forms, and nothing {{in such a}} field is more stifling to progress than limitation {{of the right to}} experiment with a new technique. The foolish judgments of Lord Eldon about one hundred years ago, proscribing the works of Byron and Southey, and the finding by the jury under a charge by Lord Denman that the publication of Shelley's Queen Mab was an indictable offense are a warning to all who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the limits of the field within which authors may exercise themselves. We think that Ulysses is a book of originality and sincerity of treatment and that it has not the effect of promoting lust. Accordingly it does not fall within the statute, even though it justly may offend many.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, the precedential {{ruling in}} In re Lovo-Lara, BIA {{established}} a precedent that invalidated the 2004 policy of rejecting all marriage applications {{in which one}} of the partners was transgender. That ruling stipulated that USCIS had to determine whether a marriage was valid in the location where it was established {{as well as in the}} location where the couple resided. The ruling of the BIA was made official in 2009 and revised in 2012. Under these rules, immigration first has to determine whether the marriage is a heterosexual or same-sex marriage in the state the couple enjoined the marriage, then the same for the state the couple resides in, and finally they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the marriage is valid under the DOMA. Although this resolved the issue of immigration for heterosexual couples from states and countries where they could get married, same-sex couples remained barred from immigration based on marriage just as other same-sex couples.|$|E
500|$|In January 1970, Rolling Stone asked Hendrix {{about having}} {{testified that he}} stopped using cannabis; he laughed and replied: [...] "At least, stop it from growing". When pressed he answered: [...] "I'm too... wrecked right now." [...] His {{management}} was concerned that the incident might provoke cancellations during the concurrent tour, but the story stayed largely unknown until after the tour had ended. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he had bribed {{a member of the}} Associated Press with a case of liquor to prevent the story from going out on the wire. Goldstein commented: [...] "I knew that a million dollars was riding on that story not getting on UPI and the AP wire... By his nature, a press agent shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> someone's future." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} levels {{was long and}} complicated. [...] It began {{with the creation of}} a general layout of the area to be built by designers. [...] They would pass this concept map to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Ray Muzyka, the co-executive producer, wrote, [...] "We learned to make sure all elements of the team are talking to each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!" [...] They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. [...] "A designer," [...] wrote Muzyka, [...] "might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, or whether we could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art." ...|$|E

2500|$|Court {{interpretations of}} this have varied from {{requiring}} [...] "just cause" [...] to denial of terminations made for malicious reasons, such as terminating a long-tenured employee solely {{to avoid the}} obligation of paying the employee's accrued retirement benefits. [...] Other court rulings have denied the exception, holding {{that it is too}} burdensome upon the court for it to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> an employer's true motivation for terminating an employee.|$|E

2500|$|For many years, the USPTO {{took the}} {{position}} that [...] "methods of doing business" [...] were not patentable. [...] With the emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of patent applications on internet or computer enabled methods of doing commerce, however, USPTO {{found that it was}} no longer practical to determine if a particular computer implemented invention was a technological invention or a business invention. [...] Consequently, they took {{the position that}} examiners would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if a claimed invention was a method of doing business or not. [...] They would determine patentability based on the same statutory requirements as any other invention.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{version of}} the Intelligent Parking Assist System, {{launched}} in 2003, was designed for reverse parallel parking. Driver intervention was not required, as the system estimated {{the size of the}} parking space and maneuvered the vehicle appropriately. This was done by an onboard computer which used a camera built into the forward and rear of the car. Sensors located at similar locations detected the proximity of nearby vehicles. The dashboard displayed an image of the lot, and the driver would then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the exact position that the vehicle in the lot via the arrows which appeared on the screen. Using the arrows, the user would set the location of the vehicle in the space. When satisfied, the user pressed the [...] "Set" [...] button, which then activated the IPAS. The system then took over steering control to maneuver the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|According to the ToK system, the [...] "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), {{is that a}} clear definition, {{an agreed}} upon subject matter, and a {{coherent}} conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire history. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fractionation and increasing insularity among the [...] "specialties." [...] In other words, the discipline has fragmented into different schools of thought and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning {{the relative importance of}} their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.|$|E
