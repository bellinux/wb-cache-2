40|$|National governments often {{choose to}} {{delegate}} tasks and burdens to lower levels {{in a comprehensive}} system of administration. Local and regional governance thereby becomes {{an important factor in}} policy implementation. This paper focuses on the incentive problem that follows from such a <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> to collect taxes and do lending at the local level in a multi-level geo-administrative system. The paper uses the Danish administrative system to illustrate the actual outcomes from such incentive problems. A two-step estimation procedure will be used to derive results on the importance of incentive problems in multi-level geo-administrative systems. Setting up elaborate administrative systems will introduce agency problems that lead to inefficiencies in both local and national governance. ...|$|R
40|$|Governmental {{positions}} are a powerful predictor of European treaty reforms. Yet, few empirical studies analyze the conditionalies between positions over different issues or conflict dimensions. If governmental {{positions are}} conditional upon the real or expected outcome on other issues, {{the sequence of}} decisions becomes increasingly important for our understanding of European treaty reforms. So far, not many studies analyze the sequence of intergovernmental decisions. In the present paper, I argue that governmental preferences over the reform of the EU decision rule dependent on the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> to the EU and vice versa. Moreover, I present a statistical model which allows for estimating this conditionality. Subsequently, I apply this model to an extensive data set of reform positions revealed by national governments at the Intergovernmental Conferences (IGC) 2003 / 4. Next, I analyze the sequence of decision taken by this particular IGC in chronological order. For this purpose, I predict the change of governmental position {{in response to the}} decisions over subsets of issues and I compare these predictions to public statements issued by governmental leaders at the time. Finally, I discuss the implications for our understanding of the intergovernmental bargaining outcome...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a number of}} indicators on various aspects of competition laws and competition agencies {{in order to make}} competition policies comparable. It contains an indicator concerned with the objectives and the instruments of competition laws, a second indicator evaluating to what degree an economic – as opposed to a legal – approach to competition policy has been chosen. Based on the assumption {{that it is not the}} content of the law alone but also the structures erected in order to implement the law, it further presents an indicator reflecting the formal independence of competition agencies and a fourth one reflecting their factual independence. These four indicators are used to estimate the effects of competition policies on economic growth. It turns out that all four variables contribute to explaining differences in total factor productivity. Yet, their impact is not particularly robust to the inclusion of indicators for the general quality of institutions.

40|$|Beyond the {{multitude}} of definitions, internal control {{is found in the}} centre of managerial concerns worldwide. This amplification of interest towards internal control has its origin in a series of events, of which two can be mentioned: the growing business complexity and dispersal activity centres, which led to the growth and development of the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> the only way which enables the responsible to exercise powers from a distance and entirely, bringing together the components needed by its delegates.

40|$|The European Union has {{developed}} new capacity {{as a security}} actor in third countries, in particular {{in the area of}} crisis management. Over the past two decades the EU has deployed numerous missions, both of a civilian and military nature. Moreover the EU has defined its ability to intervene all along the ‘crisis cycle’, (from prevention to mediation, from peace-keeping to post-conflict reconstruction) and using all tools at its disposal (taking a ‘comprehensive approach’). However the EU is still not perceived as a major security provider globally and interventions remain limited to some geographic areas, mostly in its neighbourhood and Africa, with just a few examples further afield. The EU also tends to avoid taking direct action and seems to prefer partnership arrangements with other players. How can we explain the growing activism and number of EU’s intervention with the low impact and lack of visibility? Can we expect the EU to become more active in the future, taking on more responsibility and leading roles in addressing conflict situations? This paper will argue that the main reason for the EU’s hesitant role in crisis management {{is to be found in}} the weak decision-making provisions for EU’s security interventions, as one of the few policy areas still subject to consensus amongst 28 European Union Member States. Lack of a clearer <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> or stronger coordination structures is closely linked to low legitimacy for the EU to take more robust action as a security actor. In order to overcome this legitimacy problem, and in order to facilitate consensus amongst Member States, the EU thus privileges partnership arrangements with other actors who can provide legitimacy and know-how, such as the UN or the African Union. As there is no political desire in the EU for tighter decision-making in this area, we can expect that the EU will continue to play a supporting rather than leading role in crisis management, becoming the partner of choice as it deepens its experience. However this does not mean that the EU is playing just a secondary role in the wider area of security, in particular when looking at nontraditional security. Looking at the role of the EU in Asia, where the EU has deployed just two missions, this paper will offer a broader assessment of the EU as a partner in the area of security taking into account different types of actions. The paper will argue that in order to strengthen cooperation with Asian partners in the area of crisis management, the EU will need to define better what it is able to offer, present its actions as part of an overall strategy rather than ad-hoc and piecemeal, and enter into partnership arrangements with different players in the region...|$|E

40|$|A {{little more}} than a decade ago, the Central and Eastern European Candidate Countries {{established}} strong constitutional guarantees for safeguarding their re-gained sovereignty. In order to legitimise EU membership, they are now revising the pouvoir constituant’s recent pact for sovereign governance and holding accession referendums. Probably most sensitive of all has the issue of referendum been in the three Baltic countries. This article takes a closer look and provides an overview of the process and procedures concerning referendums in the Baltic states. The first part outlines the types of referendums and their main procedural differences. The second part discusses the political and procedural tensions concerning the accession referendums, which have led to a delicate manoeuvring and, to some extent, changes of the rules {{in the middle of the}} game in all three countries. Now, ahead of EU membership, they are revising the pouvoir constituant’s recent pact for exclusively domestic exercise of powers and are in the process of amending their constitutions and holding accession referendums, in order to legitimise the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>competences</b> for exercising them jointly with EU Member States.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Scope of Nursing Decision Making Framework by the Queensland Nursing Council in 1998 was cutting-edge reform in confirming {{the role of the}} Australian nurse. The Scope of Practice Framework, now called the Decision Making Framework, is a decision-making tool designed to assist nurses with decisions about scope <b>of</b> practice, <b>delegation,</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and supervision. The application of the Framework by nurses in the aged care environment in Queensland is largely unknown. This study evaluated the implementation of the Framework in daily practice by nurse managers, registered and enrolled nurses working in residential aged care in Queensland. The methodological approach for this study was evaluation research. This approach is often aligned with organisational or community research that aims to inform policy development. Fifteen (15) nurses were recruited from two residential aged care facilities located in different regions of South East Queensland and their views were explored through focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Further insight into participants’ perspectives was gained through direct observation and documents were sought in order to achieve triangulation. Transcripts from focus groups and interviews and observational data were converted to word documents and thematically analysed to identify data-rich concepts and themes. Data were managed and analysed with the assistance of Nvivo 8 and documents were subjected to content analysis.

40|$|Purpose: In 1995 the Queensland Nursing Council {{introduced}} the Scope of Nursing Practice Framework to guide nurses in <b>delegation,</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and supervision. Two {{evaluations of the}} Framework implementation have been conducted but neither explored the Framework’s use by nurses in the workplace. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the implementation of the Framework in the daily practice of a sample of the state’s 57, 000 nurses and midwives across various contexts of practice. Methods: Evaluation methodology was used because of the ascending approach to evaluating policy rather than the ‘top-down’ approach. As such, nurses (N = 88) and midwives (N = 10) were recruited from metropolitan, regional and rural facilities working in government and privately owned hospitals, community and aged care centres. Using focus groups, participants’ views on the utility of the Framework were explored. Triangulation was achieved through observation studies of nurses and midwives (N = 6) across contexts and document analysis from participant organisations. Transcripts of focus group data were analysed using HyperRESEARCH 2. 8 to identify data-rich themes. Observation data was subjected to theoretical analysis and documents were coded and analysed using content analysis and quasi-statistical methods to identify trends. Results: The data produced 12 significant outcomes including the overt and covert pressure on nurses to work outside of their scope of practice, usually from upper to middle management in most environments. At some sites, institutional policies limited the scope of practice of the registered nurse while expanding the scope of the enrolled (licensed practical) nurse and unlicensed carer resulting in worker and workplace tension. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the evaluation method was appropriate for this study and the recommendations highlight the need for further education at all levels of nursing to strengthen the overall understanding of the principles of the Framework...|$|R
