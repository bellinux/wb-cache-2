60|$|And such a ride! Falling {{water was}} everywhere. We rode above the clouds, under the clouds, {{and through the}} clouds! {{and every now and}} then a shaft of {{sunshine}} penetrated like a search-light to the depths yawning beneath us, or flashed upon some pinnacle of the crater-rim thousands of feet above. At every turn of the trail a waterfall or a dozen waterfalls, leaping hundreds of feet through the air, burst upon our vision. At our first night's camp, in the Keanae Gulch, we counted thirty-two waterfalls from a single viewpoint. The vegetation ran riot over that wild land. There were forests of koa and kolea trees, and candlenut trees; and then there were the trees called ohia-ai, which bore red mountain apples, mellow and juicy and most excellent to eat. Wild bananas grew everywhere, clinging to the sides of the gorges, and, overborne by their great bunches of ripe <b>fruit,</b> <b>falling</b> across the trail and blocking the way. And over the forest surged a sea of green life, the climbers of a thousand varieties, some that floated airily, in lacelike filaments, from the tallest branches others that coiled and wound about the trees like huge serpents; and one, the ei-ei, that was for all the world like a climbing palm, swinging on a thick stem from branch to branch and tree to tree and throttling the supports whereby it climbed. Through the sea of green, lofty tree-ferns thrust their great delicate fronds, and the lehua flaunted its scarlet blossoms. Underneath the climbers, in no less profusion, grew the warm-coloured, strangely-marked plants that in the United States one is accustomed to seeing preciously conserved in hot- houses. In fact, the ditch country of Maui is nothing more nor less than a huge conservatory. Every familiar variety of fern flourishes, and more varieties that are unfamiliar, from the tiniest maidenhair to the gross and voracious staghorn, the latter the terror of the woodsmen, interlacing with itself in tangled masses five or six feet deep and covering acres.|$|E

Concerns regarding the etiology of this disease have been solved using molecularidentification and cross-pathogenicity tests, which have proved that peach rustyspot is caused by Podosphaera leucotricha. The usual recommended strategy for its control,by multiple treatments starting from petal fall phenophase, has not proved satisfactory inagro-ecological conditions in Serbia. After testing the fungicide efficacy, a three-year studywas carried out to determine the precise treatment terms and make the control of P. leucotrichamore efficient. The investigation was conducted in the conditions of natural infection in a Summersetcultivar orchard at the locality of Bela Crkva, during the period 2006 - 2008.

40|$|Seydou DRAME Is a Burkinabe {{journalist}} and a ClERRO (Inter-Afr can Cente for Rural Radio Studies) graduate who has devoted his working of to {{the promotion of}} agricultural information. He is a bout to publish a paper on information and the rural population, based on his eight {{years of experience in}} the field. 'Rural radio has to be learned in the field - not in an office or a classroom', says Seydou Drame, a presenter with Burkina Faso's Rural Radio Service. However he does not deny the value of his own training. Rather he feels it was because of that training that he came to understand later on that country people in Africa are too often considered as pupils, when in fact they make excellent teachers. The Burkina Faso radio clubs are dead and buried. They were born in 1975 and died in 1983. They are missed by many as an innovative method of extension work in the community and their demise is seen as a fatiure. But for me the end of the radio club was a natural event, as inevitable as a ripe <b>fruit</b> <b>falling</b> to the ground. The clubs disappeared simply because they had accomplished their mission. A short history demonstrates how this came about. When the drought was at its worst and the country's agriculture sorely needed to be put back on its feet, the authorities {{decided it was time to}} give the small farmer the education he had lacked hitherto. The radio club broadcasts took on the role of professional training, the peasant farmers became attentive pupils, and the presenters were the schoolmasters relaying the lessons to be heard in groups by the rural people. The first attempts were aimed solely at cotton growers. So successful were they in their training (work schedules, manure, pesticides, harvest, storage, etc) that yields increased and the farmers grew rich-with the help of price increases on the world market. Having a radio was one of the first signs of their increased purchasing power, so tints success brought with it an end to the communal radio classrooms. LEARNING NEW WAYS Not belonging to a radio club does not mean that the peasant farmer will no longer listen to the advice from the agricultural services. The challenge is for the presenters to devise new means of getting their message across. Thursday is the day for rural radio broadcasts in Burkina Faso. The farmer gets on his bicycle and rides off to his field with a hoe, some water and his radio which will keep him company as he works. But the farmer will not hear everything, so it's up to us to get his attention. It is all the more up to us to make an effort, since now our listeners have a free choice of station. lf we bore him he can turn to Radio Malt, Radio Benin, or Africa 1. The radio monopoly on air space is a thing of the past now, and radio communication is exactly the same for Burkina Faso as it is for the rest of the free world, so we have to be less boring and more creative. They want to hear music, everyday sounds, lively reporting, and accurate and truthful information that they can relate to their own situations. lt is no longer enough for a presenter to read the bulletins provided by the agricultural serviced; presenters must know what they are talking about. This freedom of choice has also opened up the outside world to the peasant farmer and proved that the universe no longer stops at the village boundary. The Yatenga peasant knows that there are people like him living in countries where it actually rains all the time. Radio is his ear on the outside world and we have to take advantage of this opportunity to bring him additional messages - even messages from Europe, if there is somebody there who can provide useful information in a language he can understand. ELECTRONIC PALAVER TREE As a result of this evolution, Burkina Faso is now starting to develop local radio presented by the very people it serves. With the freedom to listen came the right to speak, and it has been seized with such enthusiasm that the airwaves have become a sort of latterday 'palaver'tree. This springs out of the recognition of the value of South-South communication;we are discovering the need for a peasant-peasant dialogue. It may appear at first sight that this near take-over by the rural folk excludes outside input. On the contrary, rural radio Journalists have discovered that it is a wonderful opportunity to understand what makes the peasant farmer tick, and what kits information needs are. We must take our full part in this dialogue. How can we complain of changes which we ourselves helped to bring about? Why are we afraid of the listeners taking over the microphone? So once agate it is for us to change, to adapt, and to find a new way of addressing an audience which we have created. And then, why should the voice of the peasant farmers not be heard by his urban cousin? City-dwellers need that input in their lives as much as those who live in the country need education.

50|$|Argan <b>fruit</b> <b>falls</b> in July, {{when black}} and dry. Until this happens, goats are {{kept out of}} the argan {{woodlands}} by wardens. Rights to collect the fruit are controlled by law and village traditions. The leftover nuts are gathered after consumption and spit out by ruminating goats. Seeds spat out by the goats constitute an overlooked mechanism of seed dispersal.|$|R
50|$|The papaya {{mealybug}} inserts its stylet {{into the}} epidermis {{of the leaf}} or the skin of fruit or stem and feeds on the plant sap. At {{the same time it}} injects a toxic substance into the plant which results in chlorosis, distortion, stunting, early leaf and <b>fruit</b> <b>fall,</b> the production of honeydew, sooty mould and possibly the death of the plant.|$|R
60|$|The {{design as}} to Rome {{seems to be}} to starve out the Pope by the {{financial}} question; to let the rotten <b>fruit</b> <b>fall</b> at last as much by its own fault as possible, and by the gentlest shake of the tree. I hear of those who doubted most in the Emperor's designs beginning to confess that he can't mean ill by Italy.|$|R
