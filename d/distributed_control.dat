PID temperature controllers are applied in industrial ovens, plastics injection machinery, hot-stamping machines and packing industry. PID controllers are at the core of multirotor drones as well, in the form of self-stabilising flight controllers.|$|E

Compressed air was used both for generating the controller output, and for powering the process modulating device; such as a diaphragm operated control valve.
