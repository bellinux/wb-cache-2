The thin-walled cylindrical to club-shaped asci (spore-bearing cells) are on a short stalk, and measure 70–105 by 8–10μm; each ascus contains eight ascospores. Ascospores, which measure 45–65 by 3.0μm, have a thin but distinct sheath, and lack septa (cross-walls). Pycnidia (which appear before the apothecia mature) are intraepidermal, [...] (having the shape of a <b>double-convex</b> lens) in cross section, 0.1–0.3mm in diameter, and covered with a dark brown layer of cells. The phialides are arranged in a basal layer, and borne on short conidiophores. They are slender and subulate (tapering to a point), lack a collarette, and measure 5–10 by 2–2.5μm. The conidia are colorless, rod-shaped, lack septa, and have dimensions of 4–5 by 1.0μm.|$|E

60|$|These are the Phænomena {{of thick}} convexo-concave Plates of Glass, which are every where {{of the same}} thickness. There are yet other Phænomena when these Plates are a little thicker on one side than on the other, and others when the Plates {{are more or less}} concave than convex, or plano-convex, or <b>double-convex.</b> For in all these cases the Plates make Rings of Colours, but after various manners; all which, so far as I have yet observed, follow from the Propositions in {{the end of the third}} part of this Book, and so conspire to confirm the truth of those Propositions. But the Phænomena are too various, and the Calculations whereby they follow from those Propositions too {{intricate}} to be here prosecuted. I content my self with having prosecuted this kind of Phænomena so far as to discover their Cause, and by discovering it to ratify the Propositions in the third Part of this Book.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "lens" [...] in optics {{comes from}} the lentil-like shape of early <b>double-convex</b> lenses; lentil is lens in Latin, and gives {{its name to the}} botanical genus Lens.|$|E

50|$|The word lens {{comes from}} the Latin name of the lentil, because a <b>double-convex</b> lens is lentil-shaped. The genus of the lentil plant is Lens, and the most {{commonly}} eaten species is Lens culinaris. The lentil plant also gives its name to a geometric figure.|$|E
50|$|Traditional Japanese {{stones are}} <b>double-convex,</b> {{and made of}} {{clamshell}} (white) and slate (black). The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in Wakayama Prefecture and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam; however, due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of this clam, the stones are most often made of shells harvested from Mexico. Historically, the most prized stones were made of jade, often given to the reigning emperor as a gift.|$|E

50|$|Binocular eyepieces usually {{consist of}} three or more lens {{elements}} in two or more groups. The lens furthest from the viewer's eye is called the field lens and that closest to the eye the eye lens. The most common configuration is that invented in 1849 by Carl Kellner. In this arrangement, the eye lens is a plano-concave/ double convex achromatic doublet (the flat part of the former facing the eye) and the field lens is a <b>double-convex</b> singlet. A reversed Kellner eyepiece was developed in 1975 and in it the field lens is a double concave/ double convex achromatic doublet and the eye lens is a double convex singlet. The reverse Kellner provides 50% more eye relief and works better with small focal ratios as well as having a slightly wider field.|$|E
5000|$|In China, {{the game}} is {{traditionally}} played with single-convex stones made of a composite called Yunzi. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone. This process dates to the Tang Dynasty and, after the knowledge {{was lost in the}} 1920s during the Chinese Civil War, was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine, and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term [...] "yunzi" [...] can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made of Yunzi are also available in <b>double-convex</b> while synthetic stones can be either shape.|$|E

5000|$|This Museo Galileo {{microscope}} is {{a compound}} microscope made of cardboard, leather and wood, and is inserted in an iron support with three curved legs. The outer tube {{is covered in}} green vellum decorated with gold tooling. There are three lenses (an objective lens, a field lens, and an eyepiece), all <b>double-convex.</b> The objective measures 11 mm in diameter and has a thickness of 3.5 mm. The glass is clear with few imperfections; the edge is ground {{and there are some}} fine chips. The field lens (diameter 30 mm, thickness 4.7 mm) is in a cell that pushes {{into the bottom of the}} inner tube. The glass is amber-green, with air bubbles, and has a ground edge that is chipped; the eyepiece, with an aperture of 24 mm, also has some bubbles; it is protected by a wooden cap that screws onto the mount. The instrument is attributed to Giuseppe Campani, an Italian optician and astronomer who lived in Rome during the latter half of the 17th century, known as an expert lens grinder and instrument maker. Compound microscopes such as this first appeared in Europe around 1620 including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.|$|E
40|$|Clustering {{ensemble}} methods {{produce a}} consensus partition {{of a set}} of data points by combining the results of a collection of base clustering algorithms. In the evidence accumulation clustering (EAC) paradigm, the clustering ensemble is transformed into a pairwise co-association matrix, thus avoiding the label correspondence problem, which is intrinsic to other clustering ensemble schemes. In this paper, we propose a consensus clustering approach based on the EAC paradigm, which is not limited to crisp partitions and fully exploits the nature of the co-association matrix. Our solution determines probabilistic assignments of data points to clusters by minimizing a Bregman divergence between the observed co-association frequencies and the corresponding co-occurrence probabilities expressed as functions of the unknown assignments. We additionally propose an optimization algorithm to find a solution under any <b>double-convex</b> Bregman divergence. Experiments on both synthetic and real benchmark data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|We present novel {{algorithms}} {{for detecting}} generic visual events from video. Target event models will produce binary decisions on each shot about classes of events involving object actions and {{their interactions with}} the scene, such as airplane taking off, exiting car, riot. While event detection has been studied in scenarios with strong scene and imaging assumptions, the detection of generic visual events from an unconstrained domain such as broadcast news has not been explored. This work extends our recent work [3] on event detection by (1) using a novel bag-of-features representation along with the earth movers ’ distance {{to account for the}} temporal variations within a shot, (2) learn the importance among input modalities with a <b>double-convex</b> combination along both different kernels and different support vectors, which is in turn solved via multiple kernel learning. Experiments show that the bag-of-features representation significantly outperforms the static baseline; multiple kernel learning yields promising performance improvement while providing intuitive explanations for the importance of the input kernels. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} for inspecting transparent objects. Since the underlying optical setup {{is based on a}} schlieren setup, any defect can be detected that leads to the deflection or extinction of incident light rays. By capturing a light field image of a defect-free transparent object and by illuminating objects under test with that very light field, the proposed inspection system can visualize defects by acquiring a single inspection image only. In order to evaluate the presented approach, a physically based rendering framework is used. It is extended by models and implementations of the necessary emitter and sensor plugins. Simulation experiments with virtual scenes that consist of a <b>double-convex</b> lens affected by different types of defects are the basis for a qualitative evaluation of the proposed method. The results show that a single image acquired with the described method is sufficient to test transparent objects for defects that cause the deflection or extinction of rays, e. g., enclosed absorbing or scattering impurities, shape anomalies, differences of the index of refraction and 3 D-misalignments...|$|E
