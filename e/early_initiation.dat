60|$|In {{spite of}} his private house and his private tutor, his Grace did not make all the {{progress}} in his classical studies which means so calculated to promote abstraction and to assist acquirement would seem to promise. The fact is, that as his mind began to unfold itself he found a perpetual and a more pleasing source of study in the contemplation of himself. His <b>early</b> <b>initiation</b> {{in the school of}} Fitz-pompey had not been thrown away. He had heard much of nobility, and beauty, and riches, and fashion, and power; he had seen many individuals highly, though differently, considered for the relative quantities which they possessed of these qualities; it appeared to the Duke of St. James that among the human race he possessed the largest quantity of them all: he cut his private tutor. His private tutor, who had been appointed by Mr. Dacre, remonstrated to Lord Fitz-pompey, and with such success that he thought proper shortly after to resign his situation. Dr. Coronet begged to recommend his son, the Rev. Augustus Granville Coronet. The Duke of St. James now got on rapidly, and also found sufficient time for his boat, his tandem, and his toilette.|$|E
60|$|And yet, perhaps, {{he might}} have been coddled into a prig, or flattered into a profligate, {{had it not been for}} the {{intervening}} experience which he had gained between his school and college life. That had visibly impressed upon him, what before he had only faintly acquired from books, that there was a greater and more real world awaiting him, than to be found in those bowers of Academus to which youth is apt at first to attribute an exaggerated importance. A world of action and passion, of power and peril; a world for which a great preparation was indeed necessary, severe and profound, but not altogether such an one as was now offered to him. Yet this want must be supplied, and by himself. Coningsby had already acquirements sufficiently considerable, with some formal application, to ensure him at all times his degree. He was no longer engrossed by the intention he once proudly entertained of trying for honours, and he chalked out for himself that range of reading, which, digested by his thought, should furnish him in some degree with that various knowledge of the history of man to which he aspired. No, we must not for a moment believe that accident could have long diverted the course of a character so strong. The same desire that prevented the Castle of his grandfather from proving a Castle of Indolence to him, that saved him from a too <b>early</b> <b>initiation</b> into the seductive distractions of a refined and luxurious society, would have preserved Coningsby from the puerile profligacy of a college life, or from being that idol of private tutors, a young pedant. It was that noble ambition, the highest and the best, that must be born in the heart and organised in the brain, which will not let a man be content, unless his intellectual power is recognised by his race, and desires that it should contribute to their welfare. It is the heroic feeling; the feeling that in old days produced demigods; without which no State is safe; without which political institutions are meat without salt; the Crown a bauble, the Church an establishment, Parliaments debating-clubs, and Civilisation itself but a fitful and transient dream.|$|E
50|$|Improvement {{of breast}} feeding practices, like <b>early</b> <b>initiation</b> and {{exclusive}} breast feeding {{for the first}} two years of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million children annually. Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0-5 months first encourages <b>early</b> <b>initiation</b> of breastfeeding. Though the relationship between <b>early</b> <b>initiation</b> of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established, a recent study in Ghana suggests a causal relationship between <b>early</b> <b>initiation</b> and reduced infection-caused neo-natal deaths. Also, experts promote exclusive breastfeeding, rather than using formula, which has shown to promote optimal growth, development, and health of infants. Exclusive breasfeeding often indicates nutritional status because infants that consume breast milk are more likely to receive all adequate nourishment and nutrients that will aid their developing body and immune system. This leaves children less likely to contract diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections.|$|E

Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityPurpose: Nurse {{practitioners}} {{will be able}} {{to provide}} better screening, education, and counseling to adolescents regarding pregnancy prevention if they understand <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> as a predictor of adolescent pregnancy. This paper focuses on one predictor of adolescent pregnancy found in a review of the literature, <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation,</b> and uses the Health Belief Model as a theoretical framework to help understand the correlation between <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> and adolescent pregnancy. With this insight, practice recommendations for nurse practitioners are discussed. Data Sources: The CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases were used to search literature published in 1997 - 2007. Governmental and professional websites, as well as texts were used for supporting information to help explain theories and concepts. Conclusions: Despite efforts over the years to prevent adolescent pregnancy it is still a national public health concern. U. S. pregnancy and birth rates have decreased since the 1990 s, but we still have the highest rates among the industrialized world. Adolescent pregnancy remains of concern due to the adversities suffered by some adolescents and their children, and its effects on society as a whole. There have been numerous predictors of adolescent pregnancy identified in the literature, including <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation.</b> <b>Early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> {{is becoming more and more}} prevalent and deserves more attention as we work towards pregnancy prevention in adolescents. The relationship between <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> and adolescent pregnancy can be explained through the Health Belief Model, understanding that health-related behaviors such as <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> can lead to health threats such as adolescent pregnancy. Understanding <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> as a predictor of adolescent pregnancy and utilizing the practice recommendations in this paper, nurse practitioners can help provide better screening, education, and counseling regarding adolescent pregnancy prevention. Implications for Practice: Nurse practitioners will better understand <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> as a predictor of adolescent pregnancy and utilize the practice recommendations within this paper to routinely screen, educate, and counsel all adolescents of reproductive age to include early adolescence aiding in the pregnancy prevention efforts...|$|R

In families where child maltreatment had occurred, children were more likely to experience heightened emotional distress and subsequently to engage in sexual intercourse by age 14.

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} {{association}} between subculture affiliation (Hip-hop, Technoscene, Metal, Punk, Skinheads) and <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation,</b> and whether gender, family affluence, peer influence, lack of parental bonding and lack of parental monitoring explain this association. Methods We collected data on 15 -year-old primary school pupils {{who participated in the}} Health Behaviour in School-aged Children 2009 / 2010 study. The association of subculture affiliation with <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> was adjusted for gender, family affluence, peer influence, lack of parental bonding and lack of parental monitoring in five consecutive models using logistic regression. Results Nearly 50 % of the adolescents had a subculture affiliation. These youths were significantly more likely than other adolescents to have had sexual intercourse. Peer influence explained 49 % of this association. Adding lack of parental bonding and lack of parental monitoring into the model weakened the association of subculture affiliation with <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> (20 %), but this association remained statistically significant. Conclusion Youth subculture affiliation is strongly correlated with <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation.</b> This association is mediated for a large part by peer influence and defective parental monitoring and bonding. Health promotion regarding <b>early</b> sexual <b>initiation</b> should therefore in particular target adolescents under strong influence of peers and with weak parental relationships. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Multiple factors predict <b>early</b> alcohol <b>initiation</b> in teenagers. Among {{these are}} genetic risk factors, {{childhood}} behavioral problems, life events, lifestyle, and family environment. We constructed a developmental prediction model for alcohol initiation below the Dutch legal drinking age (16 years), elaborating on the pathways identified by earlier studies. Method: A set of 22 prospectively measured variables, previously associated with alcohol initiation, was examined by path analytic techniques {{in a sample}} of 1, 804 Dutch adolescents (ages 13 - 15 years, 56 % girls). The predictors included genetic risk for alcohol initiation and behavioral/emotional problems; prenatal and childhood stressors and childhood behavioral/emotional problems; and adolescent behavioral/emotional problems, lifestyle, family functioning, and peer-related factors. Results: The model explained 66 % of variance in <b>early</b> alcohol <b>initiation.</b> Subjects at higher genetic risk of alcohol initiation who had friends who drank alcohol and who had started smoking at an early age were at increased risk of initiating alcohol use before age 16. Behavioral (externalizing) problems were moderately and indirectly associated with <b>early</b> alcohol <b>initiation,</b> and emotional (internalizing) problems were marginally and indirectly associated with alcohol initiation.
