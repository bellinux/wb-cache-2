5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was a shift <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> among Russian audiences. Whereas they had {{previously}} been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum {{hosted a}} public celebration for the officers' return despite {{reservations}} from the royal government, {{which had been}} pressured by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> {{between the government and}} the general public increased Nasser's determination to topple the monarchy. Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of the Revolution during the siege.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} gender role beliefs and antigay prejudice in Chile and the United States. Participants were Chilean and American university students. In Study 1, Chileans were more prejudiced than Americans, and men were more prejudiced than women. In Study 2, gender role beliefs mediated cultural and sex differences in prejudice. Chileans held more traditional gender role beliefs and were more antigay than Americans. Men were more prejudiced than women, particularly <b>in</b> their <b>attitudes</b> toward gay men. Further, sex differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward {{lesbians and gay men}} were completely mediated by gender role beliefs. Nationality differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward lesbians were completely mediated, and nationality differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward gay men were partially mediated, by gender role beliefs...|$|R
5|$|Resolution 1313 was a {{significant}} shift <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> for UNAMSIL, away from its previous neutrality to support of the Sierra Leone government, a shift that made the governments of several troop-contributing nations uncomfortable. In particular, the governments of Jordan and India—two of the largest contributors, with nearly 5,000 troops between them serving with UNAMSIL—were moved to withdraw their forces. The withdrawal coincided {{with the end of}} the rainy season, after which there were fears that the RUF would resume its advance towards Freetown, and the UN and British government feared that UNAMSIL would be vulnerable. As a deterrent, the ARG was once more deployed off the coast, and was instructed to conduct amphibious landing demonstrations as a show of force.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnificent}} coronation of James II in 1685 saw the College revived as {{an institution}} of state and the monarchy. However, the abrupt end of his reign saw {{all but one of}} the heralds taking the side of William of Orange and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution. The period from 1704 to 1706 saw not a single grant of arms being made by the College; this nadir was attributed to the changes <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> of the times. The Acts of Union 1707 between England and Scotland, in the reign of Anne did not affect the jurisdiction or the rights of the College. The College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon were to exist side by side in their respective realms. However, in the matter of precedence; the Lord Lyon, when in England, was to take immediate precedence behind Garter King of Arms.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes then {{arrived in}} Cape Town to talk again with Maund. His mood was {{markedly}} different: after looking over Lobengula's message to Queen Victoria, {{he said that}} he believed the Matabele expedition to England could actually buttress the concession and associated development plans if the London syndicate would agree to merge its interests with his own and form an amalgamated company alongside him. He told Maund to wire this pitch to his employers. Maund presumed that Rhodes's shift <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> had come about because of his own influence, coupled with the threat to Rhodes's concession posed by the Matabele mission, but in fact the idea for uniting the two rival bids had come from Knutsford, who the previous month had suggested to Cawston and Gifford that they were likelier to gain a royal charter covering south-central Africa if they joined forces with Rhodes. They had wired Rhodes, who had in turn come back to Maund. The unification, which extricated Rhodes and his London rivals from their long-standing stalemate, was happily received by both sides; Cawston and Gifford could now tap Rhodes's considerable financial and political resources, and Rhodes's Rudd Concession had greater value now the London consortium no longer challenged it.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change <b>in</b> <b>attitude</b> from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E

40|$|The {{attitudes of}} the {{tertiary}} students {{who are likely to}} comprise the next generation of leaders are pivotal to understanding the challenges of nation-building and national identity formation in post-conflict settings such as Timor-Leste. This article examines post-independence debates over national identity in Timor-Leste, presenting the findings of a longitudinal survey (Dili, 2002, 2007 and 2010) of East Timorese tertiary student attitudes to national identity. In particular, {{in the wake of the}} 2006 political-military crisis, the paper examines the evidence for differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> between students from eastern and western districts, concluding that the few significant differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> peaked <b>in</b> the 2007 survey, and were associated with the overt politicization of regional identity within Dili, and concerns over post independence leadership, rather than any genuine 'ethnic' or 'regional' variation <b>in</b> <b>attitudes.</b> The paper also examines significant changes <b>in</b> some youth <b>attitudes</b> since independence, including a significant increase in the acceptance of the co-official status of the Portuguese language in the tertiary student demographic since the early years of independence. The survey also highlights the ongoing importance of tradition and adat in understandings of political community, but reveals significant gender differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards the role of traditional authorities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explored}} {{attitudes towards}} {{work and family}} roles of professional {{men and women in}} India. Ninety-two husband-wife pairs from salaried, upper middle class, dual-career families in India participated in the study. Propositions based on adult development theories of men and women, regarding reward value derived from and commitment made to occupational, parental, marital, and homemaker roles over the life cycle, were tested. Results indicated that there was no change with age, <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards occupational and homemaker roles. Instead, gender-based differences <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards these roles were observed. Attitudes towards the marital and parental role varied across the life cycle, although not in keeping with propositions based oil the adult development theories of men and women. There was no reversal <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards work and family roles of men and women after midlife. Rather, some reversal <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> appeared to occur between the marital and parental role, over the life span of both men and women. Results are reviewed within the Indian cultural context and their implications for the career development of women are discussed...|$|R
