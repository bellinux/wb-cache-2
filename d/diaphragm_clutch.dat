50|$|Stage 3: As above, and a {{velocity}} stack kit, {{valve spring}} set, stronger <b>diaphragm</b> <b>clutch</b> spring, gasket kit, high compression piston kit, high performance camshaft, and high performance ECU, track-use only.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the light car range, the Rapier's front {{suspension}} was re-engineered to replace the half king pin on each side of the car with a sealed for life ball joint. All other suspension joints became either sealed for life or were rubber bushed thereby eliminating every grease point on the car. Gearing was adjusted overall to compensate for the smaller wheels and the front brake discs were reduced in size so that they would fit inside the wheels. A brake servo became standard and the spring and damper settings were adjusted to give a softer ride. A new <b>diaphragm</b> <b>clutch</b> and new clutch master cylinder brought lighter and more progressive clutch operation.|$|E
5000|$|For the October 1962 Motor Show {{there were}} minor improvements. The rear window {{was changed to}} give the roof line an {{improved}} appearance and now more nearly match the original 1955 Chevrolet shape. Engine output was now rated at [...] bhp and the rear axle {{had been given a}} higher gear ratio. Manual gearbox cars received a new type of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>clutch</b> made by Borg and Beck and the petrol tank was enlarged from 12.5 to 16 gallons capacity. It can be distinguished by its revised rear-window treatment (doesn't wrap around quite as much as earlier models), Snipe bird badge on grille, opening quarter-light windows in the rear doors, and other trim differences.|$|E
5000|$|Laycock's {{principal}} product became spring <b>diaphragm</b> <b>clutches.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1964 Laycock's {{principal}} products were: Laycock de Normanville overdrives {{and spring}} <b>diaphragm</b> <b>clutches</b> for the motor industry and flexible couplings also for industrial use. Dual clutches for tractors, garage equipment, railway air and vacuum brakes, control valves for fluids and gases were also manufactured.|$|R
50|$|For 2013, new {{features}} include EFI Fuel-injection, a <b>diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch</b> and a lighter battery.|$|R
50|$|September 1964: Revisions: {{all models}} have <b>diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch,</b> {{improved}} heater, crush-style sun visors and plastic-framed rear-view mirror.|$|R
40|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch</b> {{mechanism}} {{is used in}} testing {{the relative merits of}} eddy-current and hysteresis dampers. The dampers are alternately coupled to a single damping boom shaft. The floating clutch mechanism enables the inoperative damper to remain completely isolated from the damping boom shaft during test of the other damper...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its aluminium engine, {{it was the first}} mass-produced British car to have an engine in the back and the first car to use a <b>diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch.</b> The baulk-ring synchromesh unit for the transaxle compensated for the speeds of gear and shaft before engagement, which the Mini had suffered from during its early production years.|$|R
50|$|A two plate dry disk <b>diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch</b> drove Fuller four-speed {{main and}} three-speed {{auxiliary}} transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive gears. The low gear allowed several very low gears for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Taking a kind {{diaphragm}} spring of automobile clutch as an example, a {{finite element analysis}} based on ANSYS WORKBENCH was studied and explained in this paper. Stress and strain variation of {{diaphragm spring}} was obtained by using static analysis, and each modal, frequency and amplitude was all achieved by applying modal analysis. And the results may provide a theoretical reference to improving structure design of automotive <b>diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is a sheet metal cover from <b>diaphragm</b> {{frictional}} <b>clutch</b> cover MF 395, made form sheet metal with thickness of 5 mm. Using numerical simulation and experiments, the stress distribution was determined in the technological process of the first deep drawing operation. The numerical simulation was performed using the software Simufact and the stress was determined by applying deformation analysis. A comparative analysis was made between the experimentally obtained results and the ones determined by numerical simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{diaphragm}} spring {{is the key}} element in modern automobile clutch. Its elastic characteristic affects the overall performance of the clutch. Taking a car as an example, According to the design requirements and characteristics, it was to establish the mathematical model of optimum design of automobile <b>clutch</b> <b>diaphragm</b> spring. It was to optimize the design parameters of {{the basic structure of}} the {{diaphragm spring}} by using the MATLAB optimization toolbox. It did finite element analysis for the 3 D modeling using ANSYS software. The results show that: it can be obtained more reasonably of the diaphragm spring elastic curve by the optimal design, shorten the design cycle, reduce the cost of...|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 KTM 300 EXC is {{the first}} {{electric}} start two-stroke enduro bike to be released by a major manufacturer. For 2010, Husaberg the other KTM owned bike company, offered the TE300, an XC-W with minor modifications to the body and suspension settings. From 2011 on the 300s got 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The 2012s got improvements to the starter, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools. The 2013s got a <b>diaphragm</b> spring <b>clutch,</b> a stronger starter and lighter battery. In 2013, the Husaberg became the Husqvarna TE300 and was given the linkage rear suspension. The 2014 had a new CDI ignition system. The 2015 model chromoly steel frame is painted orange like the motocross models. All the 2015 models have the new White Power 4CS forks with revised damping, the ability to make adjustments on the fly and a smaller front axle. The triple clamps have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric starter has different gearing to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A typical {{clutch system}} for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers hydraulic pressure generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the <b>clutch</b> <b>diaphragm</b> spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the clutch pedal’s return. The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm spring and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a clutch release system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a clutch release system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|R
