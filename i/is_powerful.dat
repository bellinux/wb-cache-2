5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{possesses}} a highly potent sting {{that can be}} painful but is short-lived. An icepack or commercially available spray {{can be used to}} relieve the pain, but individuals experiencing an allergic reaction are normally taken to the hospital for treatment. The venom <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, of which the objective was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 34 participants reacted to the venom of the green-head ant. The rest of the participants reacted to Myrmecia venom, in particular, 176 to M. pilosula alone. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. The green-head ant was the only ant that was not a Myrmecia species to cause allergic reactions in participating individuals. Green-head ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry. Despite its potential danger to sensitive humans, green-head ants can be beneficial. They can serve as a form of pest control by killing agricultural pests such as beetle and moth larvae and termites.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all {{add up to a}} picture of an army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment difficulties are confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of self-mutilation to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in the army of the Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E

25|$|What <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> about Bell's theorem {{is that it}} doesn't {{refer to}} any {{particular}} physical theory. It shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures, not just details of some particular models. No combination of local deterministic and local random variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{statistical}} learning in language acquisition {{has been particularly}} well documented {{in the area of}} lexical acquisition. One important contribution to infants' understanding of segmenting words from a continuous stream of speech is their ability to recognize statistical regularities of the speech heard in their environments.

25|$|Some {{people in}} Muslim-majority {{countries}} also see Islam manifested politically as Islamism. Political Islam <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> in some Muslim-majority countries. Islamic parties in Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria have taken {{power at the}} provincial level. Some in these movements call themselves Islamists, which also sometimes describes more militant Islamic groups. The relationships between these groups (in democratic countries there is usually at least one Islamic party) and their views of democracy are complex.|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> tool, but not always efficient. In reality, this is a drawn out process that is not very efficient. However, given the economic conditions, and that lenders' usually have priority, the sale of the property may not be sufficient to pay for the value of the lien.|$|E

The SKR <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to be detected from a spacecraft at the distance of several astronomical units from the planet. Ulysses discovered that {{the period of the}} SKR varies by as much as 1%, and therefore is not directly related to the rotation period of the interior of Saturn.|$|E
25|$|Writing <b>is</b> <b>powerful</b> in a {{different}} way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the institutions that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas {{over a long period}} of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using mnemonic tools.|$|E

The Logan suspension is soft and strong, and the chassis sits visibly higher than most other compact cars to help it negotiate dirt roads and potholes on ill-maintained asphalt roads.

25|$|Razadarit went on {{to conquer}} the entire Martaban {{province}} in 1388. After a brutal campaign that left the conquered region starving and ravaged, the victorious king handed out lavish awards and fiefdoms to his key officers. He appointed Than-Byat governor of Donwun with the title of Thamein Byat Za. The king also appointed Than-Lon governor of Taikkala, with the title of Lagun Ein ("He Who <b>Is</b> <b>Powerful</b> Like Sakra"). The king also gave him May Hnin Kaythaya, daughter of the rebellious governor Than-Lyit of Donwun.|$|E
