25|$|An equally {{important}} {{reason was that}} main memories were quite slow (a common type was <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> memory); by using dense information packing, one could reduce {{the frequency with which}} the CPU had to access this slow resource. Modern computers face similar limiting factors: main memories are slow compared to the CPU and the fast cache memories employed to overcome this are limited in size. This may partly explain why highly encoded instruction sets have proven to be as useful as RISC designs in modern computers.|$|E
2500|$|By varying {{either the}} {{inductor}} (L) or the capacitance (C), the circuit {{can be adjusted}} to different frequencies. [...] In inexpensive sets, the inductor was made variable via a spring contact pressing against the windings that could slide along the coil, thereby introducing a larger or smaller number of turns of the coil into the circuit. Thus the inductance could be varied, [...] "tuning" [...] the circuit to the frequencies of different radio stations. Alternatively, a variable capacitor is used to tune the circuit. [...] Some modern crystal sets use a <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> tuning coil, in which a ferrite magnetic core is moved {{into and out of}} the coil, thereby varying the inductance by changing the magnetic permeability (this eliminated the less reliable mechanical contact).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Radio {{interference}} (RI) of DC {{transmission lines}} {{due to the}} corona discharge has become a restraining factor of power grid’s design and operation, so the suppression of RI is very important. In this paper, a new idea for suppressing RI by mounting <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> on the conductor is proposed. By measuring and comparing RI values of the test stranded wire with and without <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores,</b> test results show this approach to suppress RI is effective. Further research results also show inhibitory effects at negative voltage are better than positive voltage and the material of <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> affects the inhibition effects...|$|R

40|$|The main {{scope of}} the article is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> gap in a universal matchbox on an ultrasonic vibrating system. A gapped transformer mechanism in a universal matchbox has been thoroughly studied. Characteristics of an ultrasonic vibrating system have been recorded such as mechanical vibrations, inductance, resonant frequencies, current and voltage levels as the gap of <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> gradually increases. In addition, the phase difference between the supplied voltage and the current is also computed and displayed in a Lissajous curve {{in order to determine}} the optimal gap between two <b>ferrite</b> <b>cores</b> in the universal matchbox.

5000|$|External core lamps are {{basically}} fluorescent lamps with magnetic cores {{wrapped around a}} part of the discharge tube. The core is usually made of ferrite, a ceramic material containing iron oxide and other metals. In external core lamps, high frequency energy from a special power supply called an electronic ballast is sent through wires that are wrapped in a coil around a toroidal <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> placed around the outside of a portion of the glass tube, creating a high frequency magnetic field within the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core.</b> Since the magnetic permeability of the ferrite is hundreds or thousands of times higher than that of the surrounding air or glass, and the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core</b> provides a closed path for the magnetic field, virtually all of the magnetic field is contained inside the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core.</b> As shown in Faraday's law of induction, the time varying magnetic field in the core will generate a time varying electric voltage in any closed path that encloses the time varying magnetic field. The discharge tube forms one such closed path around the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> and in that manner the time varying magnetic field in the core generates a time varying electric field in the discharge tube, There is no need for the magnetic field to penetrate the discharge tube. The electric field generated by the time varying magnetic field drives the mercury-rare gas discharge in the same way the discharge is driven by the electric field in a conventional fluorescent lamp. The primary winding on the <b>ferrite</b> <b>core,</b> the core, and the discharge form a transformer, with the discharge being a one-turn secondary on that transformer.|$|E
