5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Central Harmony is a smaller, square hall, {{used by the}} Emperor {{to prepare}} and rest before and during ceremonies.

All three halls feature {{imperial}} thrones, the largest and most elaborate one being that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Supreme Harmony.|$|E

5|$|Although RSV Lahn-Dill, {{eager to}} develop young players, would only let her {{play in the}} seconds, Dillmann caught the {{attention}} of national coach Holger Glinicki, who was looking for a top-notch 1.0-point player. In 2010, she rejoined the national team that she had played on before many of her new teammates were born. The team {{went on to win the}} European Championships in 2011. Dillmann's treatment contrasted with that of national team mate Gesche Schünemann. While Schünemann received endorsements and could train <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> RSV Lahn-Dill's Rivers Barracks, Dillmann got none, and trained outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Dartnell's {{status as}} a {{professional}} actor was not forgotten. Several newspaper reports after his death postulated whether his VC was the first awarded to an actor, and he is commemorated on a plaque in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Dartnell Street in Canberra is also named for him, while the German flag he captured at Bukoba is {{in the collection of}} the Royal Fusiliers headquarters in London. In 1981 Dartnell's VC and other medals were sold at a Sotheby's auction to Spink & Son for 24,000. The auction house held the medals for little more than two years before auctioning them off again in 1983 for A$36,000. The buyer donated the set to the Australian War Memorial, where they are displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Valour.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1978, the Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and end up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame. This period was characterized by the front office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It was not until the 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team.|$|E

After he spent many years in an unmarked grave, the Professional Footballers' Association, the Welsh FA, Manchester City and Manchester United all agreed {{to cover the cost of}} upkeep on a new headstone. Meredith is honoured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> fame at the City of Manchester Stadium. It was {{announced}} in August 2007 that Meredith was one of the 10 new inductees for 2007 to the English Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 1968, Peeler died at {{his home}} in South Caulfield, Victoria. Survived by his wife, Kathleen, and their four {{remaining}} children, he was buried in Brighton Cemetery. Kathleen died the following year. Peeler is commemorated in the Victorian Garden of Remembrance, and a soldiers' club in Casula, New South Wales, bears his name. His Victoria Cross and other medals are on display <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's seven All-Star team {{selections}} tie him for {{the most}} among eligible pitchers not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame, along with Lee Smith and Dave Stieb; Vida Blue and Jack Morris are the only other eligible pitchers to have started three All-Star Games. Over his three All-Star starts (each lasting three innings), Pierce allowed only one run and four hits in nine innings; his career All-Star record included a 3.38 ERA with 12 strikeouts in 10⅔ innings. Pierce and Blue are also the only eligible pitchers who have won 200 games and been named Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News more than once.|$|E

5|$|She was {{inducted}} into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1996. In 1999, her daughter Jeanne Varnell published a book titled Women of Consequence: The Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, which contains the biographies of McConnell and 58 other inductees of the Hall of Fame. The project began when Varnell set out to write a biography of her mother, but was urged by her editor {{to do the same for}} all 59 of the women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame at the time, and compile them into a book.|$|E
5|$|Stravinsky {{composed}} Threni {{between the}} summer of 1957 and the spring of 1958, beginning it on 29 August 1957 at the piano of the nightclub in the hotel where he was staying in Venice, and completing it before 27 March of the next year. It was first performed on 23 September 1958 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, Venice. The composer conducted soloists Ursula Zollenkopf, Jeanne Deroubaix, Hugues Cuénod, Richard Robinson, Charles Scharbach and Robert Oliver, the NDR Chor and the NDR Sinfonieorchester. Stravinsky dedicated the performance to Alessandro Piovesan, director of the Venice Biennale, who had recently died.|$|E
5|$|The Reliever of the Year Awards {{are based}} on the vote of a nine-member panel that {{consists}} of the top five relievers in career saves (among non-active pitchers)—Rivera, Hoffman, Lee Smith, John Franco, and Billy Wagner—and the four living relief pitchers who are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame: Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, and Bruce Sutter. Each voter selects three pitchers for each league based solely on their performance in the regular season; a 5-3-1 weighted point system is used to determine the winner.|$|E

The names of the team's original PSL owners are engraved {{on the base of}} each statue. The two people in the Panthers Hall of Honor, team executive Mike McCormack and linebacker Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium. Mills, in addition to being the only player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Honor, is the only player to have had his jersey number (#51) retired by the Panthers as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the war, Davey worked for the South Australian Railways as a labourer and linesman over three periods between 1926 and 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928, there being no children of the union. After suffering for many years with bronchitis and emphysema, he died on 21 December 1953 of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, with full military honours. In addition to the Victoria Cross, Military Medal, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Davey was also later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, {{was presented to the}} Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 1967, and is displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Valour.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{a maximum}} of four players can be {{inducted}} in one year but {{the greatest number of}} players ever inducted in a year was 23, in 1963. They were inducted because the Hall of Fame was trying to induct many pre-NHL era players. Sometimes noted as 1962 inductees, the pre-NHL era players were named at the 1962 Hall of Fame luncheon at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), but were inducted one year later, in 1963 at the CNE. 232 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while 16 European-born players have been inducted. The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs (previously the Toronto St. Patricks and Toronto Arenas), with 60. Seventy-seven defencemen are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> Fame, more than any other current position, while only 36 goaltenders have been inducted.|$|E
