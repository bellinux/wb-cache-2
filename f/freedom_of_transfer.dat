40|$|International audienceTransfer {{messenger}} RNA (tmRNA) {{directs the}} modification of proteins {{of which the}} biosynthesis has stalled or has been interrupted. Here, we report that aminoglycosides can interfere with this quality control system in bacteria, termed trans-translation. Neomycin B is the strongest inhibitor of tmRNA aminoacylation with alanine (K(i) value of approximately 35 micro m), an essential step during trans-translation. The binding sites of neomycin B do not overlap with the identity determinants for alanylation, but the aminoglycoside perturbs the conformation of the acceptor stem that contains the aminoacylation signals. Aminoglycosides reduce the conformational <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> RNA-like domain <b>of</b> tmRNA. Additional contacts between aminoglycosides and tmRNA are within the tag reading frame, probably also disturbing reprogramming of the stalled ribosomes prior protein tagging. Aminoglycosides impair tmRNA aminoacylation {{in the presence of}} all <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> RNAs from Escherichia coli, small protein B, and elongation factor Tu, but when both proteins are present, the inhibition constant is 1 order of magnitude higher. SmpB and elongation factor Tu have RNA chaperone activities, ensuring that tmRNA adopts an optimal conformation during aminoacylation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{reformulate}} the ‘colourful and fluid’ early {{debate on the}} effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) in two ways. Firstly, the wide range of separate specific concerns of the early debate are subsumed within four generic issues, (i) efficiency, (ii) distribution, (iii) sovereignty, (iv) growth and development. Secondly, the analysis is now structured around modes of analysis of multinational enterprises (MNEs), as the agents that carry out FDI. MNEs are seen as using the <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> international <b>transfers</b> central to globalisation in order to leverage competitively the differences of national (or other coherently-defined) economic units. Crucially this response to difference is analysed as reflecting three potential MNE strategic motivations, (i) market seeking, (ii) efficiency seeking, (iii) knowledge seeking. The core of the paper investigates how adoption of different motivations by MNEs would affect performance in terms of the different generic issues. The synergies of this mode of analysis with trade policy (the implicit, or often very explicit, move to outward-oriented industrialisation in the era of globalisation) and new growth theory are also discussed. ...|$|R

We focused on the two approaches that used sigmoid transfer functions. The first linear approach involved solving a set of linear equations, while the second min-max approach {{was reduced to a}} linear programming problem. We introduced regularization {{in such a way that}} the first linear approach remained linear and had a close form solution, while the second min-max approach was converted from a linear programming into a quadratic programming problem.

40|$|The article {{addresses}} a recently emerging dialogue between Freudians and Jungians, {{in particular the}} attempts {{to understand how the}} two schools of analysis developed along different tra-jectories. Two catalysts for the schism are discussed: the physician require-ment at Freudian training institutes in the US and the claim of scientific vali-dation of Freudian theory. The article argues that the attempted medicaliza-tion of psychoanalysis was a major rea-son for Jungian analysts feeling alienat-ed from psychoanalysis since Jung never placed such restrictions on admission to training. And the claim that Freud’s metapsychology met sci-entific standards seems to have had as one of its purposes to dismiss Jung’s theories, with their much less technical bend. Now that the medical degree requirement is gone and theoretical for-mulations have proliferated on the basis of narrative explanations, the author proposes a serious reassessment by both analytic schools, including dealing with the internal problems plaguing many training institutes. As a solution to these problems the article argues for establishment of non-sectar-ian standards of accreditation, with rec-iprocity and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> candidates to <b>transfer</b> from one institute to another...|$|R

40|$|The law grants {{individuals}} {{the broad}} <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> disposition {{to decide how}} their property should be distributed upon death. The rationale underlying <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> disposition is that the choices of individual donors produce results that maximize social welfare. Policymakers are rightfully skeptical that they can craft a mandatory estate plan that fits all situations or that probate courts can consistently and accurately assess the merits of particular dispositions of property. By contrast, the donor {{is in the best}} position to evaluate her own specific circumstances and to place property in the hands of the donees who will benefit the most. The donor, however, is not the sole decision-maker regarding the disposition of her property after death. To be sure, she enjoys broad freedom to craft an estate plan to her liking. But when the donor decides to make a gift to a particular donee, the donee must also make a decision. Specifically, she must decide either to accept the gift from the donor or to reject it. Whereas the donor’s discretion to decide which testamentary gifts to make is referred to as <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> disposition, the donee’s discretion to decide which testamentary gifts to accept or to reject can be labeled “freedom of inheritance. ” Although legal scholars have paid much attention to the donor’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> disposition and have explained that it plays an important role in maximizing social welfare, relatively little attention has been paid to the donee’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> inheritance and the role it plays in maximizing the utility generated from the donor’s estate. To fill this analytical void, this Article defines the donee’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> inheritance and identifies how it works in concert with the donor’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> disposition to maximize social welfare. Ultimately, this Article argues that the donee’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> inheritance is an important part of the process <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> wealth after death and that policymakers should strive to facilitate the donee’s exercise <b>of</b> this <b>freedom</b> when crafting the law of succession...|$|R

Article 49 and 54 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) grants persons and companies the right to set up establishments and pursue economic activity within the Member States of the European Union, the articles are however complicated and the Court of Justice has in many case explained how these articles are to be interpreted. A company is free to establish itself through a primary establishment in any Member State and has the right to open up secondary establishment in another Member State.

40|$|In this work, an {{introductory}} exposition {{of the laws}} of thermodynamics and radiative heat transfer is presented while exploring the concepts of the ideal solid, the lattice, and the vibrational, translational, and rotational degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> heat <b>transfer</b> in this manner helps scientists to recognize that the laws of thermal radiation are strictly applicable only to the ideal solid. On the Earth, such a solid is best represented by either graphite or soot. Indeed, certain forms of graphite can approach perfect absorption over a relatively large frequency range. Nonetheless, in dealing with heat, solids will eventually sublime or melt. Similarly, liquids will give way to the gas phase. That thermal conductivity eventually decreases in the solid signals an inability to further dissipate heat and the coming breakdown of Planck’s law. Ultimately, this breakdown is reflected in the thermal emission of gases. Interestingly, total gaseous emissivity can de- crease with increasing temperature. Consequently, neither solids, liquids, or gases can maintain the behavior predicted by the laws of thermal emission. Since the laws of thermal emission are, in fact, not universal, the extension of these principles to non-solids constitutes a serious overextension of the work of Kirchhoff, Wien, Stefan and Planck...|$|R
