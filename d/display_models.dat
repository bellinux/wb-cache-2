5|$|The {{only other}} {{buildings}} on the site are two outhouses, located {{to the rear of}} the school building. Both are non-functional, <b>display</b> <b>models.</b> One outhouse is an original 1870s structure, transported to the site and reassembled. The other outhouse is a copy, built from salvaged materials during the school restoration. Neither outhouse is historically associated with Chana School and both are considered non-contributing factors in the schoolhouse's National Register of Historic Places listing.|$|E
25|$|Other plastic-kit <b>display</b> <b>models</b> were {{released}} by MPC-ERTL in 1:25 scale. One was a 1984 2M4 kit 10883, {{the other was}} 1987 (essentially identical to 1986) GT kit 6401. Decal set 230 for the Fiero Indy Pace car was also released by Fred Cady Decals and were available by mail order.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-scale}} wooden {{model was}} built by Emil Cherubin in 1932. It was displayed in various places in Nazi Germany until 1939. It was also featured on a postcard. Cherubin had served with a Bertha battery during World War I. Afterwards, he turned his model-making talents to building wooden models for museums, theatres, and other displays. He also built 1/4-scale <b>display</b> <b>models</b> of Bertha and the Paris Gun.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} three-dimensional <b>display</b> <b>model</b> of a {{human being}} which can be used to display the results of three-dimensional simulation programs that predict the positions of an occupant during impact of a vehicle was presented. The model allows the user to view the occupant from any orientation in any position during the crash. The <b>display</b> <b>model</b> assumes the usual break up of the body into rigid segments which is normal for occupant crash simulation programs, but the shape of the segments in the <b>display</b> <b>model</b> are not necessarily the same as those used in the crash simulation. The <b>display</b> <b>model</b> is proportioned so as to produce a realistic drawing of the human body in any position. Joints connecting the segments are also drawn to improve realism...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, a German company, Flug Werk GmbH, began {{manufacturing}} new Fw 190 {{models as}} reproductions. By 2012 almost 20 had been produced, most flyable, a few as static <b>display</b> <b>models,</b> with airworthy examples usually powered by Chinese-manufactured Shvetsov ASh-82 twin-row, 14-cylinder radial powerplants, {{which have a}} displacement of 41.2 litres, close to the BMW 801's 41.8 litres, with the same engine cylinder arrangement and number of cylinders.|$|E
25|$|PMC's early International {{models were}} usually molded in bright yellows, oranges, reds, and sky blues and were toy-like, but very attractive. Many {{of these were}} not promotional models, exactly, rather <b>display</b> <b>models</b> for the showroom. Some 1951 trucks can be found {{with a hole in}} the roof and chassis where a metal display post passed through the vehicle. Besides a pickup truck, the 1951 line {{featured}} a larger dumper/flatbed truck, a flatbed stake truck, and a moving truck. The 1955, 1956 and 1957 pickups show a decade long PMC relationship with IH. The 1955 International pickup was later offered by Canadian Kempro, of London, Ontario (Hover 2011).|$|E

5000|$|Another {{factor was}} that people working at mass-market retail stores lacked the {{specialized}} training Apple offered to its dealers. The Performa <b>display</b> <b>models</b> were often poorly taken care of; the demo computers crashed, the self-running demo software not running or the <b>display</b> <b>models</b> not even powered on. Consumers {{who may have been}} purchasing their first computer were steered away from the Performas because they [...] "weren't compatible". Apple tried to address the training issue by hiring their own sales people to aid the store sales staff, most of them recruited from Macintosh user groups. Despite this, however, many returned Performa computers could not be serviced properly because the stores were not authorized Apple service centers.|$|E

5000|$|Hecht {{states that}} he was confronted with what seemed a mundane problem: When showing {{speakers}} at various audio shows, onlookers often poked at the two-inch dome tweeters of the <b>display</b> <b>models,</b> sometimes cracking them.

50|$|Model {{railroad}} clubs exist where enthusiasts meet. Clubs often <b>display</b> <b>models</b> for the public. One specialist branch {{concentrates on}} larger scales and gauges, commonly using track gauges from 3.5 to 7.5 in. Models in these scales are usually hand-built and powered by live steam, or diesel-hydraulic, and the engines are often {{powerful enough to}} haul dozens of human passengers.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Dragon {{started the}} Dragon Wings line of 1/400 scale aircraft, aiming {{not only at}} {{collectors}} but also airline companies who need <b>display</b> <b>models.</b> These models are sold fully finished. Over 100 commercial and national airline models have been released since then. Dragon is the officially appointed supplier of aircraft models for Airbus and Boeing for their promotional and souvenir purposes.|$|E

50|$|The {{jack rabbit}} {{has become the}} symbol of Odessa. Beginning in 1932, Odessa held a rodeo for roping rabbits. In one competition, cowgirl Grace Hendricks roped a rabbit from horseback in five seconds and beat her male competitors. The unusual rodeo ended in 1977 because of {{objections}} from the Humane Society. Many businesses and residences about Odessa <b>display</b> <b>models</b> of rabbits.|$|E

50|$|Mini-Z is a {{brand name}} for a popular line of 1:27-scale {{electric}} radio-controlled cars manufactured by Kyosho Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer of various radio-controlled devices. Kyosho makes {{a huge number of}} bodies for the Mini-Z. The wheelbase is nominally 94mm but can range from 86mm to 106mm. The bodies are all highly detailed, realistic looking, and fully painted with a high gloss paint. The bodies are so realistic that many are collected as <b>display</b> <b>models</b> and the bodies come with a dummy chassis and wheels for display purposes.|$|E
50|$|Model {{engineers}} typically make models by machining {{working parts}} from stock metal and metal castings. Some models are intended as utilitarian working models, others as highly meticulous <b>display</b> <b>models,</b> or sometimes {{a combination of}} both. The most elaborate models involve hand manufacture of thousands of parts, taking thousands of hours to complete, often {{over a number of}} years or even decades. The model engineer is often guided by commercially available drawings, however some draw their own designs, or even work without drawings. Similarly, most model engineers will buy castings when required, but some buy or make foundry equipment to cast metal themselves.|$|E
