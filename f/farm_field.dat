5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a <b>farm</b> <b>field.</b> A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
25|$|Study and Core Area {{boundaries}} {{delineate the}} historical extents of a battlefield. POTNR boundaries delineate areas within the Study and Core Area(s) that still retain integrity and {{remain to be}} preserved. The Study and Core Area boundaries define the historic landscape of the battlefield while areas that retain integrity define the modern landscape. For example, if a particular <b>farm</b> <b>field</b> was important during the battle but now is covered by a housing development, {{it would still be}} included in a Core or Study Area boundary because the <b>farm</b> <b>field</b> informs the history of the battle. That same <b>farm</b> <b>field,</b> however, would not be considered for inclusion in an POTNR boundary because it no longer has integrity (i.e. conveys a sense of the historic scene) and there is nothing left of the original <b>farm</b> <b>field</b> to preserve.|$|E

500|$|The massive tornado {{continued}} north, following Main Street {{into the}} south side of Greensburg. Many homes (including an entire row of seven adjacent residences) were swept completely away in this area just south of town, three of which were well-bolted to their foundations. Damage in this area was rated EF5 as a result. The tornado weakened slightly as it entered residential areas in southern Greensburg, but remained violent as numerous homes were destroyed or leveled. Continuing north, downtown Greensburg was completely devastated by the tornado, with numerous businesses destroyed. Two schools, a tractor supply company, the Greensburg City Hall and other businesses fell victim to the violent winds and were destroyed or flattened. A motel {{on the west side of}} town was severely damaged, trees throughout the town were completely denuded and debarked, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of feet. The city's water tower was completely toppled and smashed, and the visitor's center at the Big Well (which is the world's largest hand-dug well) was completely destroyed. Train cars were also overturned and hazardous materials teams were called to inspect the wreckage. A tank car carrying about 14,000 gallons (53,000 liters) of ammonia started to leak when workers lifted it. The courthouse and the grain elevator were spared the worst of the tornado's effects. Meanwhile, the Greensburg meteorite, which was feared to have been blown away, was found and recovered a few days afterwards. Greensburg High School was mostly destroyed by the tornado, sustaining EF4 damage. Numerous homes were swept away across from the high school, four of which were well-bolted to their foundations, warranting an EF5 rating at those residences. The Kiowa County Memorial Hospital was severely damaged at EF3 intensity, and a 4.9-ton reinforced concrete beam was lifted from the structure and thrown onto a nearby vehicle. Past downtown, neighborhoods in northern Greensburg were flattened before the tornado left the city limits. The tornado continued north of Greensburg, executing a loop in a <b>farm</b> <b>field</b> before dissipating. The total path length was , and the width of the funnel reached [...] Overall, 95% of Greensburg was destroyed. A total of 961 homes and businesses were destroyed, 216 received major damage and 307 received minor damage.|$|E
