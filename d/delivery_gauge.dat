40|$|Background Since the {{introduction}} of the renal access coordinator (RAC) role into Australia there have been only anecdotal examples of associated improvements in patient outcome and service delivery and scant published quantitative extant evidence exists. Aim To review the literature related to the impact of RACs on dialysis patient outcomes and associated service <b>delivery,</b> <b>gauge</b> the level of evidence available and identify gaps in the literature. Method A three stage Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review process was used to collect and synthesise data. The review considered studies that explored and measured the RAC role in the adult haemodialysis context. All quantitative study designs were considered. Due to lack of homogeneity a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Results Five studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. All studies included multidisciplinary teams with variable emphasis on the RAC role. Four pre post intervention cohort studies measured incident and/or prevalent AVF, AVG and CVC rates in the haemodialysis population and the quality assurance report measured differences in patency rates between AVF and AVG and associated hospital length of stay. All discussed the role of central coordination as a contributor to the success of vascular access care. Conclusion The available reports do suggest an association between RACs and improved patient outcomes. These improved patient outcomes were apparent in an increase in incident and prevalent AVFs, and a decrease in the incidence and prevalence of CVCs. Both associations are correlated with a reduction in infection rates, length of hospital stay and healthcare costs  ...|$|E

40|$|Postoperative biliary {{stricture}}s are {{the most}} common cause of benign biliary stricture in Western countries, secondary to either operative injury or bile duct anastomotic stricture following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Surgery or endoscopic interventions are the mainstay of treatment for benign biliary strictures. We aim to report the outcome of 2 patients with refractory anastomotic biliary stricture post-OLT, who had successful temporary placement of a prototype removable covered self-expandable metal stent (RCSEMS). These 2 patients (both men, aged 44 and 53 years) were given temporary placement of a prototype RCSEMS (8. 5 Fr <b>gauge</b> <b>delivery</b> system, 8 mm × 40 mm stent dimensions) in the common bile duct across the biliary stricture. There was no morbidity associated with stent placement and removal in these 2 cases. Clinical parameters improved after the RCSEMS placement.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{determine}} if there is a difference in force decay between three sliding retraction methods under a standardized force delivery system (200 gm at 25 mm stretch) at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Background: In order to achieve proper esthetics, occlusion and stability, orthodontic treatment may require extractions. Elastomeric chains, Nickel Titanium (NiTi) coils, and active ligatures are commonly used to close these extraction spaces. Methods: Twenty samples of each retraction method (elastomeric chains, NiTi Coils and active ligatures) were evaluated under standardized conditions (200 gm at 25 mm). The force of each retraction method was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks on a customized force gauge test stand (Shimpo FGV- 1 XY force gauge; Shimpo Instruments, Itasca, IL). Ten control samples were evaluated at 0 weeks and left un-stretched until the final measurement at 8 weeks. All samples were stored in a bath of Fusayama/Meyer artificial saliva (Pickering Laboratories, Mountain View, California) at 37 °C in order to simulate the oral cavity. Results: At 2 weeks, the NiTi coils maintained their force while both the elastomeric chains and active ligatures experienced a statistically significant decrease in force over time. At 4, 6, and 8 weeks, the force of the elastomeric chains and active ligatures continued to decay and demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in force as compared to the NiTi coils and each other. At 8 weeks, the NiTi coils, elastomeric chains and active ligatures maintained 94. 0 %, 66. 8 % and 50. 9 %, respectively. This signifies a hierarchy of force decay with NiTi coils maintaining the largest amount of force, followed by the elastomeric chains and then the active ligatures. Conclusion: There is {{a significant difference in the}} amount of force decay of the three retraction methods over time under a standard initial force delivery of 200 gm over a 25 mm stretch. NiTi coils provide the light and constant force desired for efficient and biologically compatible tooth movement. The elastomeric chains maintained a larger amount of force than expected and have proven to achieve comparable tooth movement to NiTi coils in clinical studies. Active ligatures do not appear to be an effective means of force <b>delivery.</b> A force <b>gauge</b> is recommended to evaluate all forces placed clinically...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{therapy is}} a {{promising}} and rapidly developing medical approach, {{the aim of}} which is to transfer therapeutic genes into target cells to replace or destroy an "abnormal" disease-causing gene. However, a significant impediment to this approach becoming a therapeutic tool in the clinic is the lack of safe and effective delivery systems, coupled with a poor universal understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to gene delivery. Thus, the broad aim of the studies described herein is to explore the mechanisms of gene delivery from different aspects, and then design and develop novel non-viral vectors with the aim of improving our understanding of how vectors behave and how rational design can then be employed to overcome biological barriers. It is apparent from our recently published review that non-viral reducible vectors, comprising disulfide bridges lead to selective (intra- over extracellular delivery) and more efficient intracellular gene release, resulting in higher transfection efficiencies (c. f. non-reducible vectors). However, existing synthetic strategies to introduce disulfide bridges into molecules employ costly reagents and are laborious. In our research, we designed and compared three approaches toward introduction of disulfide bonds into peptides and assessed the efficiency of each via construction of model tripeptide ‘HO-Cys((S-S-(CH 2) 2 -NH 2) -Lys-Gly-H’ using Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The first two methods describe on-resin manipulation to introduce the terminal –S-S- bond, while the third, innovative approach utilizes a newly developed disulfide bridge-ready amino acid. Development of Boc-Cys(S-S-(CH 2) 2 -NHBoc) -OH is firstly described and its stability profile also investigated. Its application toward the facile preparation of a disulfide-based tripeptide has been successfully demonstrated. Molecular dynamics (MD) can be used for exploring the structure, dynamical process and binding energies of biomolecular complexation on the molecular level. However, existing MD simulations for polymer-gene complexation do not correlate well with biological experiments/ conditions. In this thesis, systematic investigations of the complexation process of siRNA-cationic polymer were performed by MD simulations and their effects in gene release within the cytosol were analysed. Firstly, we studied the conformational fluctuation of double-strand 21 base-pair siRNA in the aqueous environment by MD simulations to provide clues into the complexation processes that occur with other biomolecules/carriers, which added a dynamical perspective beyond the static information available from X-ray data and the effects of complexation with other biomolecules for two conformations of siRNA. Changes in the two conformations of siRNA in aqueous solution were analyzed from three perspectives these being, major groove width, inclination angle and base pair per helix. Next we studied the single cationic polymer-siRNA complexation process by MD simulations. The simulations reveal detailed molecular-level pictures of the structures and dynamics of the RNA-polycation complexes. Estimates for the binding free energy indicate that electrostatic contributions are dominant followed by van der Waals interactions. The binding free energy between 8 +polymers and RNA was found to be greater than that of 4 +polymers, and was in general agreement with previously published data. Reliable binding free energies were firstly introduced to provide an effective index of the ability of the polycationic carrier to bind a nucleic acid and also carry implications for the process of gene release within the cytosol. Moving forward we investigated a highly complex system whereby multiple cationic polymers-siRNA complexation was studied by MD simulations, a scenario that represents more closely, the processes occurring at a cellular level when genes and vectors associate. At lower charge ratios polymers bind quite effectively to siRNA, while at high charge ratios the complexes are saturated and there are free polymers which are unable to associate with RNA. We also observed reduced fluctuations in RNA-structures when complexed with multiple polymers in-solution compared to both free siRNA in water and the single polymer complexes. These novel simulations provide a much better understanding of key mechanistic aspects of gene-polycation complexation and thereby advance progress towards rational design of non-viral gene delivery systems. Live cell imaging experiments are increasingly useful qualitative and quantitative tools for <b>gauging</b> <b>delivery</b> to cells and determining the fate of both gene and vector once delivered. In the tail-end of the thesis we explore the uptake of oligo-dendrimer complexes in NIH 3 T 3 EpoR cells via the use of two different dyes (green and red) independently labelled to an oligonucleotide and dendrimer. Albeit unsurprisingly we demonstrated that the oligonucleotide alone is unable to translocate the cell membrane; this result being effectively reversed in the presence of preformed oligo-dendrimer complexes. A gradual increase in charge ratio further facilitated the delivery of oligo-dendrimer complexes, but we observed an inverse relationship i. e. delivery efficiency reduced on increasing oligo length. Furthermore, delivery rates for single strand oligos appeared to be better than double strand oligos, under identical conditions. Overall, our research systematically investigated the mechanisms relating to the gene delivery from chemical, physical and biological perspectives, which will effectively facilitate the rational design of gene delivery systems in the future...|$|R
