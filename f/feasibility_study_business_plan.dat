This thesis identifies determinants of business development success for Value-Added Producer Grant (VAPG) recipients. Success is categorized in nine different stages of development:(1) creation of an idea, (2) formation of the idea into a written plan as a <b>feasibility</b> <b>study,</b> <b>business</b> <b>plan,</b> or marketing plan, (3) formation of an organizational structure for the idea, (4) the hiring of a manager or employees for the idea, (5) raise capital for the idea through equity drives, (7) creation of the idea into a product in a facility, (8) distribute and sell the product, (9) and whether the product was being sold in March of 2006. The data involves information on 621 grant recipients. Two econometric models are {{used to evaluate the}} data. The number of USDA Rural Business and Cooperative Employees, the value-added producer grant amount divided by the number of producers in the organization, the 2006 organizational sales divided by the number of producers in the respective organization, and the total production of the organization divided by the national production of the respective crop were significant variables. These four size variables had a negative impact on an organization being in steps one though eight, but a positive impact on being in step nine, which was the successful stage of business development. (such as dairy, flowers, fruit, nuts, specialty meats, wheat, and wine were positively associated with successful VAPG grant recipients.

The first section of the study comprised a search for available material on the topic. Information regarding <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plans,</b> and the difference between the two, was gleaned from contemporary literature covering the subject, such as tutorials by the Small Business Development Corporation, as well as several local and international text books, in order to construe an appropriate framework for the compilation of such a study. In the second section of the dissertation the framework decided on was applied to a specific business idea. Information for the completion of this section was obtained by interviewing representatives actually engaged in a similar enterprise, requesting information from various departments of state and business enterprises, as well as searches in relevant literature. The dissertation concludes by reiterating that the purpose of such a study is purely to determine the viability or feasibility of a project or business idea, and should it be necessary to obtain funds from third parties in order to initiate such a business (given a positive result from the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study),</b> a comprehensive <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> should be compiled [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of conservation agriculture (CA) {{is discussed in}} the context of producing food for a growing population while, at the same time, conserving and improving the natural resource base: sustainable crop production intensification. CA requires mechanization, and the necessary equipment may be {{beyond the reach of the}} majority of smallholder farmers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. A logical solution to this situation is to provide CA mechanization services from private sector entrepreneurs. These will be well-equipped with appropriate CA equipment and will usually benefit from specific training on the technical aspects of CA machinery operation and on the business skills needed to run a profitable venture. The technical skills to be reinforced include: equipment selection, calibration of planters, seeders and sprayers, field operation, maintenance and repair. Business skills needed include: market research and <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>business</b> <b>planning,</b> calculation of operational costs, partial budgets, break-even points and cash flows. The case is made for local manufacture to reduce the costs of machinery acquisition and to encourage local adaptation. Start-up costs are discussed together with the options of obtaining finance. Guidelines for marketing and managing the mechanization service provision business are developed. These include the {{importance of}} contracts, work planning, regular maintenance schedules and record keeping. Finally the most appropriate vehicle for delivering the training and sustaining support is considered. Formal training courses are a good starting point, but can be expensive to organize and execute. Individual counselling from extension sources is a viable option when the quality of the service is high enough. Study groups of involved entrepreneurs should be encouraged and supported to overcome the problems that will inevitably arise in new business ventures...|$|R

Enterprise {{is often}} {{described}} as risk for reward, but {{it may be possible to}} reduce the risk while improving returns. According to SEDA, failure rates of SMMEs in South Africa range from 70 to 80 percent. The need for this study arose when it was found that most SMMEs did not have a formal system in place to mitigate their risks right from the outset in the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study,</b> the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> design and the start–up of the business. This lack of mitigation controls could be a result of a lack of understanding of the enterprise risk management (ERM) methodology or an inappropriate ERM decision–making model to assist them in a way that would mitigate their risk and minimise financial losses. The ERM approach can anticipate unplanned occurrences and is a systematic way of foreseeing the future. Entrepreneurs and business owners take on risks to pursue new business objectives within their respective risk appetites. This study also evaluated several models of risk identification and the ERM methodology. In this study an ERM model, ISO 31000, was applied in a business case and a comparison was made between the risks identified in the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> and the ERM approach. Master...|$|R
40|$|The North Dakota Agricultural Products Utilization Commission (APUC) has {{the mission}} of {{creating}} new wealth and jobs {{through the development of}} new and expanded uses for North Dakota agricultural products. The Commission administers four grant programs encompassing basic and applied research, farm diversification, marketing and utilization, and prototype development. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Commission's success in attaining its goals. The project team examined the outcomes of a sample of grant recipients from each program type to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the program in meeting its stated objectives. The time frame for the evaluation was 1995 - 2004. During the study period, a total of $ 9. 3 million was awarded to 396 projects. Marketing and utilization grants accounted for 54 percent of awards and 70 percent of total funds awarded. The review of the four APUC grant programs indicates that each program appears to be quite successful in meeting its objectives. The farm diversification grantees who were contacted generally indicated that their projects had been implemented as planned, and most had plans to continue or expand their new enterprises. Prototype development by its very nature is a high risk venture, but of seven grant recipients contacted, two had commercialized their products, reporting annual gross revenues of $ 100, 000 and $ 750, 000, respectively. Two others reported that their products were nearing commercialization and were planning to begin marketing in 2007. Basic and applied research grants typically represent front-end efforts to develop and commercialize new products, crops, or value-added opportunities. Several of the basic and applied research grant recipients contacted were able to report very concrete outcomes with substantial economic impacts. Finally, the marketing and utilization grants program supports a diversity of projects directed at market analysis, <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> development, and related services to support the launch and/or expansion of value-added enterprises. This program has supported the launch of a number of major processing ventures, as well as a number of smaller projects. The larger and more successful projects assisted by this program have made very substantial economic contributions. For example, nine agricultural processing projects supported by APUC during the 1995 - 2004 period are estimated (when fully operational) to contribute more than $ 157 million annually to the state economy, to support almost 2, 300 new jobs, and to result in $ 2. 4 million in added state sales and use and personal income tax revenues annually. In addition, APUC support has assisted the launch of a number of smaller enterprises which are important to the livelihood of the individual, may provide employment opportunities that would not otherwise exist, and may have potential for future growth. economic development, agricultural processing, North Dakota, Agribusiness, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2007. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The Goverment of the Republic of Namibia {{soon after}} independence, {{recognised}} its cardinal national responsibility {{to change the}} orientation of the nation's economy from one of exporting raw materials and importing final-use products to in-country production of goods based on the country's resource endowment. One productive sector for which explicit and far-reaching guiding policies, strategies and programmes have been developed and instituted from the beginning is the promotion of highly competitive industries with special emphasis on SMEs as a major pathway to progressive and sustainable industrialisation and employment and the simultaneous development of entrepreneurial culture. In recognition of the critical role the SMEs can play in the socia-economic development and economic diversification of the country, the Government of Namibia through its Ministry of Trade and Industry has put in place policies and programmes, specifically for the development of SMEs. To this end, the Ministry of Trade and Industry realised that the lack of bankable <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> limited entrepreneurs' access to finance and this posed the biggest challenges to the growth of the SME sector in the country. This has been conceived as a daunting factor and stems from the reality that entrepreneurs cannot provide bankable <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> to back up their applications. Given the prevailing condition, the Government of Namibia initiated the MSME <b>Feasibility</b> <b>Studies</b> and <b>Business</b> <b>Plan</b> Support programme ~ specifically geared to assist the SME sector with bankable <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> in order to induce financial institutions to provide loans to entrepreneurs with viable project ideas and prospects for success. The objective of the study is to explore the extent to which this support programme has facilitated the access to finance by SMEs and the creation of sustainable businesses. The findings of the study have established that worldwide some of the developed and developing countries initiated and implemented similar govemmental programmes in the form of subsidies to the services rendered by third parties to SMEs in business-plan formulations and related advisory services. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Kort na onafhanklikheid het die regering van Namibia besef dat die landsekonomie minder afhanklik moet word van grondstof-uitvoere en die invoer van vervaardigde goedere, met groter klem op die verwerking van plaaslik vervaardigde grondstowwe. In die verband is kleinsake as 'n belangrike ontwikkelingsinstrument beskou en 'n vername skepper van nuwe werksgeleenthede, wat juis in die uitvoer-georienteerde landbou- en mynbou-sektors aan die kwyn is. Om hierdie herorientasie van die ekonomie te bevorder het die Ministerie van Handel en Nywerheid verskeie programme ontwikkel, veral vir die bevordering van kleinsake. In die verband is die probleem van bankfinansiering as 'n besondere knelpunt beskou, met die gebrek aan omvattende sakeplanne vir finansierbare projekte gesien as kemprobleem. Met die oogmerk het die Ministerie die "SME <b>Feasibility</b> <b>Studies</b> and <b>Business</b> <b>Plan</b> Support programme" ontwikkel, ten einde finansiele instellings te motiveer om meer geredelik finansiering te verskaf. Hierdie studie ontleed die bestaande program, sy agtergrond, ontwikkeling en probleme asook die baie beperkte sukses wat tot sover bereik is. Vergelykings met programme in ander lande suggereer dat verreikende aanpassings nodig is om die program meer betekenisvol en suksesvol te maa...|$|R
50|$|Throughout 2005, the Board {{prepared}} {{an economic}} <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plan,</b> {{conducted a survey}} of other facilities, considered potential design consultants, engaged in community consultations and developed a vision statement. In November 2005 the Board hired Angus Matthews on a two-month contract to assess the information and community feedback the Board had acquired. Matthews was asked to provide concept for the new facility. At this point, there was considerable urgency as Marker Group had the building well under construction and on target for a May 2006 opening. Matthews became a catalyst for action and presented the Board with a bold proposal for a $5 Million aquarium of the Salish Sea. With {{the full support of}} the Board, he presented the concept at a community meeting held at the Mary Winspear Centre in Sidney on December 14, 2005. Andre and Associates of Victoria assisted Matthews in producing the first conceptual drawings and experiential story-line for what soon became the final concept. The project now had considerable momentum. After conducting a search, the Board appointed Angus Matthews as the first Executive Director of the Society. Matthews' mandate was to finalize the concept, produce plans and budgets for both construction and operations, direct and participate in the fundraising campaign, oversee construction of the facility, develop a branding, marketing and communications program, and have a fully operational aquarium staffed, stocked and ready to open in just 31 months by June 20, 2009.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to show how market {{research}} can be done without resorting to expensive, full-blown surveys, or without having to acquire off-the-shelf market/industry studies that may be relatively less expensive but still not enough to meet the details needed by the <b>business.</b> The <b>study</b> is being done under the Philippine setting, where the data gathering challenge would be more formidable than in countries with more developed data base system and with {{a significant number of}} private market data providers, such as the US.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis is to use several managerial tools in order to plan how to start a private Moroccan-Czech business in the Czech Republic. In order to achieve this goal, the {{main objective}} was subdivided {{in a set of}} partial goals. To start a business includes firstly to have an idea and to consider its viability through a <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> before planning its execution. Secondly, to support the startup process from the procedural point of view, it is reasonable to use project management since it revealed processes that are common to any project lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, control and closure. The application of these processes helps to create a structured action plan. In order to answer all questions, the thesis is divided in three steps. In the first one, project management is explained as well as its concepts and processes and application method. The second step describes the methodology of a startup business; and the third step is the achievement of the constructed methodology in a real <b>business</b> <b>planning,</b> that is monitored and evaluated continuously.
