40|$|In 2004 it was timely {{to reconsider}} the {{personality}} of Jean RIST (19001944) who, sixty years earlier, was at {{the origin of the}} foundation of <b>IRSID</b> and who gave his life for the liberation of his country. This paper recalls his career from 1923 to 1943 at the "Establissements Jacob HOLTZER", his active contribution to the "Cercle d'Ettudes des Metaux" of Saint-Etienne right from the creation of this association, his commitment at the "Comite d'Organisation de la Siderurgie" in 1943 - 1944 for the draught of the founding principle of <b>IRSID,</b> his participation to the "Resistance" until the sacrifice of his life. This paper should incite to meditate on the example of this visionary engineer, deeply concerned with research in industry and of this idealistic citizen, a man honored by SF 2 M by the creation of the Jean RIST medal...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the reduction of chromium from a quaternary slag by carbon dissolved in liquid steel. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted to study the reduction of chromium oxides in the slag by carbon dissolved in the melt. These experiments were made under different conditions of slag basicity and amount of added carbon. Thermodynamic calculations based on Double Sublattice model were applied using the commercial software Thermo-Calc, with the <b>IRSID</b> database. The results obtained showed good correlation with practical and calculated results, {{making it possible to}} predict equilibrium conditions of the system and to determine the activities of chromium oxides in the slag...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{continuous}} casting process for steel slab production is modelled using a mult-physics approach. For this purpose, a Finite Volume (FV) numerical model {{was constructed in}} 3 D, with the following characteristics: Time dependent, turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer in the molten steel and flux regions, solidification of the skin layer, under prescribed heat loss boundary conditions, particle tracking simulation of argon bubbles injected with the metal into the mould, full coupling between bubbles and liquid through buoyancy and interfacial forces using a novel gas accumulation technique, and a full transient simulation of flux-metal interface behaviour {{under the influence of}} gravity and fluid inertial forces and bubble plume buoyancy. The unstructure mesh FV code PHYSICA developed at Greenwich was used for carry out the simulations with physical process data and properties supplied by <b>IRSID</b> SA...|$|E
40|$|During {{pyrolysis}} and carbonization of coal, the viscoelastic properties vary {{across a}} wide range, with complex viscosity (eta*) decreasing to as low as 100 Pa s before increasing to approximately 10 (8) Pa s and phase angle (delta) varying from close to 90 degrees (Newtonian liquid) down to 0 degrees (Hookean solid). A new rheometry method has been developed that combines tests using 25 and 8 mm plates to enable measurements of the entire resolidification process. When combined with thermogravimetric analysis, the method has provided {{new insights into the}} mechanisms leading to high and low <b>IRSID,</b> I 40 strength indices. Although coals with very different volatile matter contents have similar rates of volatile release above 475 degrees C, viscoelastic properties above this temperature are highly variable. From a study of 13 coals, all coals for which delta 65 degrees at 475 degrees C had an I 40 index > 44...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} torsion testing, the microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties produced in a 0. 14 %C- 1. 18 %Mn steel were investigated {{over a wide}} range of hot rolling conditions, cooling rates and coiling temperatures. The reheating temperature was varied between 800 $ sp circ$C and 1050 $ sp circ$C, and strains between 0 and 0. 8 were applied. This led to austenite grain sizes ranging from 10 to 150 $ mu$m. Two cooling rates, 55 $ sp circ$C/s and 90 $ sp circ$C/s, were applied and cooling was interrupted at coiling temperatures ranging from 550 $ sp circ$C to 300 $ sp circ$C. Optical microscopy and TEM were used to study the microstructures. The mechanical properties were studied by means of tensile testing. A method developed by <b>IRSID</b> for deducing the transformation kinetics from the cooling data was adapted to the present context and used successfully to interpret the observed influence of the process parameters.

40|$|Today {{there is}} a strong demand from {{different}} industries to use local fracture criteria in a simplified way. This paper presents the main results of a two years joint research project where CEA, EDF, School of Mines and <b>IRSID</b> were associated. A simplified method based on the Beremin models for cleavage and ductile fracture has been developed. This procedure can be used to evaluate the risk of fracture of industrial structures or to allow a rapid development of new materials. Finite element simulations were systematically performed for axisymmetrically notched tensile and precracked specimens using a parametric description of stress-strain laws. Results were presented in the form of graphs that can be used directly for measuring local fracture parameters from tests on axisymmetrically notched specimens and to predict fracture toughness. An additional parameter measuring the level of plastic constraint has been taken into account. This parameter can be easily evaluated on industrial structures. This allows a simple way of using local criteria to evaluate the safety of such structures...|$|E
40|$|Steelmaking {{today is}} carried out in batch processes. However, in many {{industries}} {{it has been found}} that continuous processes are more efficient than batch processes. In the 19602 ̆ 7 s it was shown in the WORCRA, <b>IRSID</b> and other trials {{that it is possible to}} produce a high quality refined steel continuously. The WORCRA process utilised counter-current flow of the slag phase with respect to the metal phase. One of the failings of this process that has been cited by others is low productivity. This was due, in part, to low mixing intensity in the melting region of the furnace. The current study is focussed on understanding the relationship between the melting zone mixing intensity and axial dispersion in an attached refining channel for a geometry similar to that of the WORCRA process. An important finding of this work was that changes in the mixing intensity had little effect on the dispersion in the refining channel. Other findings include, (1) there was a decrease in axial dispersion in the launder as the fluid flow rate was increased, (2) tuyère gas injection in the channel had no apparent influence on waves travelling along the channel, and (3) that the discontinuous nature of the ejection of water from the exit of the model was caused by slopping in the melting zone...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{work performed}} at IRSID/USINOR in France and the University of Greenwich, UK, to investigate flow structures and turbulence in a water-model container, simulating aspects typical of metal tundish operation. Extensive mean and fluctuating velocity measurements were performed at <b>IRSID</b> using LDA {{to determine the}} flow field and these {{form the basis for}} a numerical model validation. This apparently simple problem poses several difficulties for the CFD modelling. The flow is driven by the strong impinging jet at the inlet. Accurate description of the jet is most important and requires a localized fine grid, but also a turbulence model that predicts the correct spreading rates of jet and impinging wall boundary layers. The velocities in the bulk of the tundish tend to be (indeed need to be) much smaller than those of the jet, leading to damping of turbulence, or even laminar flow. The authors have developed several low-Reynolds number (low-Re) k–var epsilon model variants to compute this flow and compare against measurements. Best agreement is obtained when turbulence damping is introduced to account not only for walls, but also for low-Re regions in the bulk – the k–var epsilon model otherwise allows turbulence to accumulate in the container due to the restricted outlet. Several damping functions are tested and the results reported here. The k–ω model, which is more suited to transitional flow, also seems to perform well in this problem...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} towards the {{development}} of a laboratory-scale method for the evaluation of the cold mechanical strength of blast-furnace coke {{from the point of view}} of cohesion and abrasion. The indices derived from this test, CS 10 and CS 1, are defined as the weight per cent of coke with a particle size > 10 and En este trabajo se describe la puesta a punto de un método a escala de laboratorio, que permite evaluar la cohesión y abrasión de coques obtenidos a escala piloto. Se definen dos índices de resistencia mecánica en frío, CS 10 y CS 1, como la cantidad de coque de tamaño mayor de 10 mm y menor de 1 mm, respectivamente, que se obtiene después de someter una muestra de 200 g de coque, con tamaño de partícula 19 - 22, 4 mm, a 1. 200 vueltas en un tambor que gira a 20 rpm. Los nuevos índices están relacionados con los derivados del ensayo normalizado <b>IRSID,</b> 120 e 110, utilizados por la industria siderúrgica para el control de la calidad de coque de horno alto. Los coques estudiados se obtuvieron en un horno de pared móvil de 250 kg de capacidad, a partir, tanto de carbones individuales como de mezclas industriales de carbones. De los resultados, se deduce que el método desarrollado utilizando el tambor descrito en el método NSC de resistencia mecánica después de reacción con dióxido de carbono, puede usarse en la valoración de coques obtenidos en hornos de menor escala, en los que la cantidad de coque producida es insuficiente para llevar a cabo ensayos normalizados que requieren una mayor cantidad de muestra...|$|E
