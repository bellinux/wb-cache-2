5|$|By {{the time}} Crease left again for Canada in April 1858, {{he had married}} Sarah Lindley and had three young {{daughter}}s, Susan, Mary, and Barbara. Sarah {{was the daughter of}} the famous botanist, John Lindley. She was also a talented amateur artist, and would go on to create many drawings and watercolours of early BC. Unable to find work in Toronto, Henry decided to try <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> in Victoria, and arrived there in December.|$|E
5|$|Between his 1969 {{victory in}} the race and 1981, Andretti {{dropped out of the}} races due to part {{failures}} or crashes. <b>His</b> <b>luck</b> seemed to turn around in 1981. Andretti finished second in the 1981 Indianapolis 500 by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser. The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a $40,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, a fire {{broke out}} in a wing of Dunvegan Castle, and {{according}} to Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, the flames were checked and extinguished when the flag was carried past to safety. During the Second World War, {{the chief of the}} clan, Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod, received a letter from a member of the clan who attributed <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> during bombing missions over Germany to a photo of the flag which he carried in his pocket.|$|E
5|$|The player {{plays the}} role of Buck Mann, a space runner down on <b>his</b> <b>luck.</b> A former {{military}} pilot and racer, Buck begins to accept jobs from large corporations when his money runs out. Accompanied by the android, Adaam-12, he first accepts a job from the Big Cargo corporation carrying simple cargo containers. Shortly afterwards, the Nuclear Star corporation approaches him to carry nuclear waste. After several runs, Buck Mann attracts the attention of the pirates Brown Beard and Captain Black, who continuously harass him as his missions become more and more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe <b>his</b> <b>luck.</b> By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the {{backseat}} of his car: after he pushes <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this {{would be the end of}} his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E

5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> to score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take. However, {{in the remainder of}} the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.|$|E
5|$|Tallon's {{little left}} finger swelled {{up after the}} Third Test and he {{exacerbated}} the injury during a tour match against Middlesex, ruling {{him out of the}} Fourth Test at Headingley, which Australia won to secure the series. He returned for the Fifth Test at The Oval, taking three catches, including an acrobatic catch of Len Hutton down the leg side that was considered the catch of the season. He scored 31 as Australia sealed the series 40 with an innings win. When the last match of the tour against Scotland in Aberdeen became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> at bowling leg spin. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Tallon scored only six in Australia's 236 {{and then took}} 0/10 in Scotland's second innings and did not take a catch in the innings victory. In the second match in Aberdeen, Tallon kept wicket, conceding 26 byes and not taking a {{dismissal}} {{and he was not}} required to bat. When the match became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position in Scotland's second innings, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> at bowling leg spin. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match. Tallon took 2/15 as Australia finished the tour with another innings win.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was noted}} as a goalkeeper for making {{seemingly}} impossible saves. He {{was said to}} have unbelievable good luck - the ball often hit the post when he played in goal. Due to <b>his</b> good <b>luck,</b> <b>his</b> opponents' supporters called him [...] "Leiteria" [...] (lucky man) and Fluminense supporters called him [...] "Saint Castilho".|$|R

5|$|For the Battle of Romani, Chauvel {{chose his}} ground carefully, reconnoitring {{it from the}} ground and the air, and {{selecting}} both forward and fall back positions. <b>His</b> <b>luck</b> held; the German commander— Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein— selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General Edward Chaytor's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130British casualties, it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{track down}} Weems, a {{handyman}} at an apartment building. He refuses {{to testify against}} Cutrona. Weems has a fascination with Rube Goldberg machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Scully concludes {{that there is no}} X-File, but Mulder believes that <b>his</b> <b>luck</b> is the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in an improbable cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom (when he forgot the car keys), he accidentally shoots a lamp that knocks over an ironing board, then trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder notes that Weems was the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.|$|E
