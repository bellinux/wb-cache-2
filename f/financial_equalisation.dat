Business, tourism and finance constitute the backbone of the local economy. In 2000, the tertiary sector offered 90% of all jobs in Lugano, of which 75% were occupied by commuters, many of which commute from neighbouring Italy (approximately 13% of the active working population); in the same year tax revenues reached CHF 104 million, of which CHF 59 million were attributable to the banking sector. The city is Switzerland's third largest banking centre after Zürich and Geneva. With regards to intercommunal <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation,</b> thanks to its financial strength Lugano contributes significantly to the equalisation fund.

40|$|Thesis (LLD (Public Law)) —University of Stellenbosch,In this {{dissertation}} {{a comparative}} study {{is made of}} the constitutional accommodation {{of the distribution of}} financial resources and constitutional obligations to the various spheres of government in Germany and South Africa. Both countries have decentralised or multi-level systems of government and can be classified, in terms of current studies on federalism, as integrated or cooperative federal systems. An overview of the historical developments, the political contexts, the fundamental principles and the constitutional frameworks for government in Germany and South Africa is provided as a basis for the in-depth analysis regarding the financial intergovernmental relations in these countries. This study has shown that economic theory is important in the design of decentralised systems of government and that political and socio-economic considerations, for example, the need for rebuilding Germany after World War II and the need to eliminate severe poverty in South Africa after 1994, often play a dominant role in the design and implementation of decentralised constitutional systems. The economic theory applicable to decentralised systems of government suggests a balanced approach to the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations with a view to obtaining the most efficient and equitable solution. In both countries the particular constitutional allocation of obligations and financial resources created a fiscal gap that required some form of revenue sharing or <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation.</b> The German <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> system has been developed over fifty years and is quite complex. It attempts to balance the constitutional aim of reasonable equalisation of the financial disparity of the Länder with the financial autonomy of the Länder as required by the Basic Law. The huge financial and economic demands from the eastern Länder after unification in 1990 placed an additional burden on the available funds and on the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> system. Germany currently faces reform of its <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> system and possibly also bigger constitutional reform. The South African constitutional system is only a decade old and the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> system that is less complex than the German system, is functioning reasonably well but needs time to develop to its full potential. The system may however require some adjustment in order to enhance accountability, efficiency and equity. A lack of sufficient skills and administrative capacity at municipal government level and in some provinces hampers service delivery and good governance and places additional pressure on the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> system. The Bundesverfassungsgericht and the Constitutional Court play important roles in Germany and South Africa in upholding the principle of constitutional supremacy, and make a valuable contribution to the better understanding of the constitutional systems and the further development thereof. This study has shown that clear principles in constitutional texts, for example, such as those contained in the Basic Law, guide the development of applicable financial legislation and add value to the provisions on <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> and how they are implemented. These principles in the Basic Law are justiciable and give the Bundesverfassungsgericht an important tool to adjudicate the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> legislation. The study of the constitutional accommodation of the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations in Germany and South Africa is not an abstract academic exercise and should be seen in the particular political and socio-economic contexts within which the respective constitutions function. The need to give effect to the realisation of socio-economic rights, for example, the right of access to health services, places additional demands on the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> system. The South African society experienced a major transformation from the apartheid system to a democratic constitutional order that in itself has had a significant influence on financial intergovernmental relations. This dissertation focuses on a distinct part of constitutional law that can be described as financial constitutional law. This comparative analysis of the two countries has provided some lessons for the further development of South Africa’s young democracy, in particular the financial intergovernmental relations system...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{classical}} theoretical expectations, our empirical {{study shows}} that financial transfers to decentralised governments increase local public expenditures much more than would be triggered by an equivalent rise in local income. This empirical evidence {{of the presence of}} a flypaper effect is achieved using panel data from 375 municipalities located in the Swiss canton of Vaud covering the period 1994 to 2005. During that time there was a major change in the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> scheme. Furthermore, our study confirms the analysis of the public choice theory: the effect depends partly on the degree of complexity of the municipal bureaucracy. These results show that local bureaucratic behaviour may impede the effectiveness of a <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> scheme that aims to reduce disparities in local tax...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the Slovenian Financing of Municipalities Act, which had been in force since April 20062, and the new act, which entered into force on 1 st January 20072. The main question asked is how the changed formula for calculating the appropriate expenditure and the capitation introduced affect the financing of municipalities. The primary hypothesis is that the change introduced would positively affect the share of own revenues in the appropriate expenditure of the majority of municipalities, that the influence of <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> would decrease and that the financial independence of municipalities would increase. Concurrently, the extent of municipal financial surpluses that have not been regulatory treated until this change would decrease. The results, presented in this article, confirm the suggested hypothesis that was proven by past data and a simulation of the new situation. appropriate expenditure, <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation,</b> capitation, municipality diversity index surplus, Slovenia. ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, the European Communities have seen rapid {{developments}} towards {{economic and political}} integration. This thesis argues that the institutions and decision-making structures of the European Communities resemble those of a union of states {{at an early stage}} of federal integration. However, as an entity with more than one level of government, the Communities are subject to the main objective of federalism: how to simultaneously achieve the contradictory aims of unity and diversity. At the heart of this conflict lies the issue of regional disparities and to what extent within a federal framework such disparities should be reduced.;To answer this question, the thesis undertakes a comparison of the European Communities with a federal entity of similar character, yet one {{at the opposite end of}} the process of integration: the Federal Republic of Germany. As a highly integrated federation within which the centre and the constituent units co-operate strongly with one another, the Federal Republic of Germany provides a good example of how authority may be shared and divided between the Community level and the Member States in future. The degree to which a federal union is politically integrated has a direct effect on the quality of its redistributive policies, and on who will be responsible for those policies.;If the European Union is indeed heading towards more integration, it may one day decide to compensate for more general political unity by shifting responsibility for regional redistribution back to its constituent units. This would mean the adoption of a horizontal <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> scheme amongst the Member States instead of a centrally organised cohesion policy. However, the main lesson from Germany is that <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> does not reduce regional disparities, and that the EU has already found, in the form of the Cohesion Fund, a preferable approach...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{resources}} are of essential importance for optimal local government functioning. Without a sufficient level of autonomy and resources, fiscal federalism {{is nothing more}} than an external appearance. With only one lower tier of government (municipalities), Slovenia is among the countries with a relatively low degree of decentralisation. The share of local finance amounts to around 5 % of GDP (EU around 12 %). Although the law allows creation of more lower tiers, no such units have been created yet. There are currently 193 municipalities, varying greatly in terms of population. Most of the local financial model discrepancies derive from: a) an inappropriate vertical tax structure and low level of local fiscal autonomy, b) an inadequate system of <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> that is a strong disincentive to revenue mobilisation, c) absence of correlation between normative and actual expenditure/revenue, disregarding local characteristics, wealth and tax base, d) politically enforced decisions to found some 'fictitious' units, consequently reducing the role of local officials in political bargaining and lobbying. ...|$|E
