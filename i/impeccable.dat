5|$|At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura soon {{finds himself}} unable to {{penetrate}} Ip's <b>impeccable</b> defense and is overwhelmed by his relentless and direct blows. Unable to defend himself, Ip effortlessly uses {{him like a}} wooden dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him.|$|E
5|$|He was courageous in battle, {{open and}} straightforward, incorruptible and <b>impeccable,</b> and strict towards himself. He {{cared about the}} masses, and was never {{concerned}} about his own advantage. He was never afraid of difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he was dilligent, honest, and he had an utmost sense of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Bugle rank {{consists}} of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are well respected in the band and have <b>impeccable</b> marching abilities. Each bugle rank member carries a bugle with a banner, but are never played during a performance. Together, the drum majors and bugle rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field. In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre.|$|E
5|$|Massenet {{composed}} {{many other}} smaller-scale choral works, {{and more than}} two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. His choice of lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems from overseas, including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation. Grove comments that Massenet's songs, though pleasing and <b>impeccable</b> in craftsmanship, are less inventive than those of Bizet and less distinctive than those of Duparc and Fauré.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have <b>impeccable</b> manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with <b>impeccable</b> records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E
5|$|Malgudi is a fictional, semi-urban town in {{southern}} India, conjured by Narayan. He created {{the town in}} September 1930, on Vijayadashami, an auspicious day to start new efforts and thus chosen for him by his grandmother. As he mentioned in a later interview to his biographers Susan and N. Ram, in his mind, he first saw a railway station, and slowly the name Malgudi came to him. The town was created with an <b>impeccable</b> historical record, dating to the Ramayana days when {{it was noted that}} Lord Rama passed through; it was also said that the Buddha visited the town during his travels. While Narayan never provided strict physical constraints for the town, he allowed it to form shape with events in the various stories, becoming a reference point for the future. Dr James M. Fennelly, a scholar of Narayan's works, created a map of Malgudi based on the fictional descriptors of the town from the many books and stories.|$|E
5|$|Mandarin and Malay, in particular, {{the local}} variety of Malay, that is, Sarawakian Malay or Bahasa Sarawak, are widely spoken here. English is spoken to some extent, with most Mirians being {{incapable}} of speaking English with <b>impeccable</b> grammar. The respective ethnic groups also speak their own languages. Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and Malay) rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, or Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an effort has been made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and <b>impeccable</b> black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{constant}} bickering between the Irish and British representatives to the Vatican pleased neither Dublin nor London. It {{paved the way}} for Bewley to obtain the appointment he really wanted. He went to Berlin in July 1933. President of Germany, Hindenburg, praised his <b>impeccable</b> German.|$|E
25|$|Entrance to this Guard {{was only}} {{possible}} for soldiers of <b>impeccable</b> character and conduct. The {{commander of the}} Hartschier troop had the title Generalkapitän (see also Captain General), associated with the highest class ranking in the Hofrangordnung (court order of precedence). He was appointed personally by the king.|$|E
25|$|The {{hierarchical}} system of Zen has attracted severe {{criticism in the}} west, because of the misconception of the role and degree of awakening of Zen teachers. The term rōshi {{has been applied to}} implicate a certified state of awakening, implying <b>impeccable</b> moral behaviour. Actual practice shows that this has not always been the case.|$|E
25|$|Military Division: the {{military}} decoration is awarded {{to members of}} the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with <b>impeccable</b> service of not less than 15 consecutive years, and who were awarded the Order or Medal for Courage displayed in the performance of military duties, or two or more awards of federal ministries or governmental agencies.|$|E
25|$|Its clear, almost {{conversational}} prose, {{devoid of}} jargon and overly specialized terminology, makes it especially suitable for undergraduates {{as well as}} the general public. The widely published Hartmann is eminently qualified to write such a work.

25|$|The {{beauty and}} variety of tone, the <b>impeccable</b> mechanism, and the noble, architectonic {{conception}} were great pianism and great musicianship. It is not customary to compare the work of local artists favorably {{with that of the}} foreign-born great, but I cannot refrain from doing so in this case, because {{it seemed to me that}} Mr. Kirkpatrick was playing the piano as it is not often played by anybody.|$|E
25|$|Civilian Division: the {{civilian}} decoration is awarded to {{citizens of the}} Russian Federation, elected or appointed to a position {{in accordance with the}} Constitution of the Russian Federation and federal laws, as well as to civil servants, for concrete contributions to the development of Russian statehood, strengthening {{the rule of law and}} order, and <b>impeccable</b> service of more than 15 years, as well as for other productive activities which brought substantial benefits to the Fatherland.|$|E
25|$|As JetBlue gained market share, {{they found}} a unique {{positioning}} where they competed with other low-cost carriers (e.g. Southwest, and Frontier), as well as major carriers (e.g. American, United, and Delta). Amenities such as their live in-flight television, free and unlimited snack offerings, comfortable legroom, and unique promotions fostered an image of <b>impeccable</b> customer service that rivaled the major airlines while competitive low fares made them a threat to low-cost no-frills carriers as well.|$|E
25|$|Despite her poor prospects, {{she has two}} {{eligible}} suitors. Within {{four days}} of making her acquaintance, Will Belton proposes marriage to her. Belton is warm-hearted, kind, and generous, and these qualities make a strong impression on Clara. However, she believes herself in love with Captain Frederic Aylmer, although he has given no clear signs of feeling that way toward her. Aylmer is <b>impeccable</b> in his manners, smooth, urbane, well-read, {{and a member of}} Parliament; compared to him, Belton is awkward and unpolished.|$|E
25|$|Ertl sported an <b>impeccable</b> Inspector Clouseau-style {{moustache}} and beard. Basically a journalist, {{he worked}} his way through the German Formula Vee and Super Vee, and then on to Formula Three, before a successful switch to Touring Cars. During this period, he gained sufficient sponsorship to entry Formula One, with various outfits between 1975 and 1980. Ertl is probably best remembered as one of the four drivers who helped to get Niki Lauda out of his burning Ferrari in the 1976 German Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Always {{more of an}} {{establishment}} figure than any sort of rebel, {{it was no surprise}} when Stewart was asked to captain England in 1998 when Mike Atherton resigned. Despite being the age of 35 at the time, Stewart's level of fitness was <b>impeccable,</b> especially bearing in mind that most players do not continue beyond 37. As it was Stewart went on to play for England beyond his 40th birthday – but as events were to transpire – his captaincy of England barely lasted 12 months.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most {{rulers of}} that era, Umar formed a council {{with which he}} {{administered}} the province. His time in Medina was so notable that official grievances sent to Damascus all but ceased. In addition, many people emigrated to Medina from Iraq seeking refuge from their harsh governor, Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef. That angered Al-Hajjaj, and he pressed al-Walid to remove Umar. Much {{to the dismay of}} the people of Medina, al-Walid bowed to Hajjaj's pressure and dismissed Umar from his post. By this time, Umar had developed an <b>impeccable</b> reputation across the Islamic empire.|$|E
25|$|Various anecdotes in Livy's {{history of}} Rome reflect the toga's {{symbolic}} value. In one, the patrician hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, retired from public life and clad (presumably) in tunic or loincloth, is ploughing his field when emissaries of the Senate arrive, {{and ask him}} to put on his toga. His wife fetches it and he puts it on. Then he is told that he has been appointed dictator. He promptly heads for Rome. Donning the toga transforms Cincinnatus from rustic, sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless, of <b>impeccable</b> stock and reputation – into Rome's leading politician, eager to serve his country; a top-quality Roman. Rome's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all Rome's great men wore togas, and must always have done so.|$|E
25|$|That same year, Robert F. Kennedy {{was widely}} {{considered}} an <b>impeccable</b> choice {{to run as}} Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn. Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate. Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent {{in the office of}} vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.|$|E
25|$|Controversy erupted at the Women's Gymnastics All-Around final, when gymnast after gymnast {{fell on the}} vault. Some gymnasts were {{physically}} injured, and all were shaken, but nothing was done to try to discover the reason most gymnasts were having severe problems. Finally, {{in the middle of}} the third round (out of four), it was determined that the vault horse had been set 5cm too low– enough of a difference to throw off the <b>impeccable</b> timing of many of these world-class athletes. While athletes were allowed to vault again, the remedy did not fully repair injuries and shaken confidence. This situation led directly to the elimination of Svetlana Khorkina from consideration as the top all-around gymnast. The medals were eventually all won by Romanian gymnasts, with Andreea Raducan becoming the first athlete from her country to win the title since Nadia Comaneci in 1976. Teammates Simona Amanar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively. This result also marked the first sweep of the event since the Soviet Union's in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Héctor {{attended}} the local Juan Morel Campos Public School of Music {{where the first}} instrument he learned to play was the saxophone. His classmates included José Febles and multi-instrumentalist Papo Lucca. One of his teachers was very strict and demanded that he practice good diction and manners, and have a strong stage presence. He felt Héctor would become a superstar as a bolero singer. From the start Héctor was a star with exceptional charisma, talent, and charm. One of a kind, his unique voice, refined and with <b>impeccable</b> diction, demanded attention. Well {{on his way to}} becoming a popular-music vocalist, he began frequenting clubs such as Segovia, where he sang accompanied by his childhood friends, Roberto García and José Febles. At age 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band. He moved permanently to New York on May 3, 1963, against his father's wishes, as an older brother had moved there and later died of a drug overdose. It would take many years before Héctor was able to reconcile with his father.|$|E
25|$|The governess {{occupied}} a uniquely awkward {{position in the}} Victorian household, because she was neither a servant nor yet {{a member of the}} host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away {{from the rest of the}} family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an <b>impeccable</b> reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.|$|E
25|$|In September 2000, George Dalaras collaborated, for {{the first}} time, with them BBC Concert Orchestra, {{one of the most}} {{outstanding}} British orchestras. They met at the packed theatre Odeon of Herodes Atticus in a recital of superb orchestrations for a grand orchestra under the direction of Nick Davies and the participation of Joan Faulkner, the famous American jazz singer. The concert, the tickets of which had been sold out days before, was repeated in October of the same year in London’s Royal Festival Hall with the participation of the big School *In October 2000, four concerts that were staged in Cyprus signaled George Dalaras’ collaboration with the famous Kremlin Moscow State Symphony Orchestra. This was an event in which Margarita Zorbala, the exquisite performer, had also taken part. The Kremlin Symphony Orchestra consists of 70 superb soloists while, its main characteristic is the coalescence of the instrumental harmony structure with an <b>impeccable</b> technique and artistic expression. Pavel Ovsianikov is the artistic director and conductor of the orchestra; he is a composer who, {{in the course of his}} creative career, has managed to combine the preservation of the rich Russian cultural heritage with the quest for new musical ideas. In November 2000, they, once more, met in Russia, in a concert that was staged in Grand Kremlin Palace’s George Hall.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has <b>impeccable</b> effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E
25|$|The gloom {{increased}} during tea {{and play}} was delayed {{regardless of the}} vocal protests of the 32,000 strong crowd, with some being arrested {{as they tried to}} invade the ground. When play resumed Amiss and Cowdrey – his 114th and final Test – came out to open. They stayed out long enough for Amiss to be out lbw to a Lillee swinger for his third successive duck and stumps were drawn at 15/1. In the morning Walker had Cowdrey caught behind off a ball that bounced surprisingly, but Lillee pulled up with a trapped nerve in his foot and was unable to play {{for the rest of the}} Test. With their two strike bowlers removed and the damp spot drying out Australia struggled and Denness and Edrich took full advantage, taking the score from 18/2 to 167/3 with a third wicket stand of 149 and overtaking the home side's total with ease. There were some difficult chances off the England captain, but it was the otherwise <b>impeccable</b> Edrich who was out for 70 edging Walker to Ian Chappell at first slip. The vice-captain was replaced by Keith Fletcher who had suffered so much in the series with Denness, but now proved that they were attractive batsmen when not faced by blistering pace and England were 273/3 by the end of the day. Walker bowled manfully and Mallett tried to stop the flow of runs, but when Walters and Chappell were brought on for long spells the game was up. Denness was almost run out on 94 and bought up his hundred with a leg-glance that just missed Marsh's gloves, but rode his luck well. He was only the fourth England captain to make a Test hundred in Australia after Andrew Stoddart's 173 in 1894–95, Archie MacLaren's 116 in 1901–02 and Peter May's 113 in 1958–59. When Walker finally had him out caught and bowled the next day he had made 188 in 492 minutes with 17 fours, still the highest Test century by an England captain in Australia. Denness and Fletcher had added 192 for the fourth wicket took take the score to 359/4, the first time England had passed 300 in the series. Fletcher made his first Ashes century in 333 minutes with only seven fours, though he and Greig added 100 runs in 71 minutes as the big South African started thumping the tired bowlers around the deserted ground. By tea the third new ball had been seen off and England were 496/4, a lead of 344. Discussion of when Denness would declare were rendered null and void when the bullish Walker ran through the England batting as the tourists lost 6 wickets for 33 runs after tea. The tall Tasmanian had already taken 3/131, but produced a spell of 5/12 as Greig was caught off a mistimed drive for 89 off 94 balls, followed later in the over by Fletcher for 146. Old was bowled by a shooter from Dymock, who bowled just as long and as well, but with no luck. Alan Knott and Geoff Arnold were caught behind glancing the ball and Underwood was bowled to dismiss England for 529, only their second score over 500 in Australia since Bodyline in 1932–33. Walker returned to the pavilion with figures of 8/143 off 42.2 overs, his best analysis in Tests.|$|E
