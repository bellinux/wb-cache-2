25|$|By {{examining}} the common solutions of the equations of two spheres, {{it can be}} seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the radical plane of the intersecting spheres.

25|$|Gay {{people could}} seldom be {{convinced}} that heterosexual sex would {{provide them with the}} same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of this technique, many vendors of intrusion prevention systems will search for this pattern of no-op machine instructions {{in an attempt to}} detect shellcode in use. It {{is important to note that}} a NOP-sled does not necessarily contain only traditional no-op machine instructions; any instruction that does not corrupt the machine state to a point where the shellcode will not run can be used in place of the hardware assisted no-op. As a result, it has become common practice for exploit writers to compose the no-op sled with randomly chosen instructions which will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> effect on the shellcode execution.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} long-run time series for price {{aggregates}} is, {{that they often}} disregard many qualitative changes in the components of those aggregates, or, {{it is assumed that}} these qualitative changes <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> quantitative significance for comparative purposes. A variable is thought to stay qualitatively the same across time, when in reality it does not remain the same. Michael Perelman, for example, shows that the content and economic meaning of capital aggregates can change considerably even within one decade or so. For example, the changing stratification of physical capital assets in the total capital stock, in terms of their age, exerts an independent influence on the productivity and profitability of enterprises.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Oceania, particularly the Outer Party members, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way telescreens {{so that they}} may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E

500|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the [...] "external" [...] cardinalate was revived during the Great Western Schism, but in another form and for other reasons. Popes from the rival obediences gave the cardinalitial dignities to the churchmen serving European monarchs (Crown-cardinals) without calling them to the Roman Curia, in order to assure {{the support of the}} monarchs. These cardinals continued to reside in their countries. Additionally, the curial cardinals in 13th century started to cumulate a great number of the benefices, {{from the time of the}} Schism including also the episcopal sees. After the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the cardinals occupying external bishoprics were generally obliged to reside in them. Today, the majority of the cardinals are simultaneously diocesan archbishops or bishops, and they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> jurisdiction over their titular churches at Rome.|$|E

500|$|In July 1938, White {{represented}} Australia at an inter-governmental {{conference on}} Jewish refugees held at Évian, France, {{to discuss the}} growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories. [...] He expressed remorse after listening to stories from refugees during the conference, but ultimately hedged his offer of support, saying that, [...] "As we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration". [...] Australia {{would go on to}} accept 15,000 refugees over three years. White's reaction to the Australian government's support for the Munich Agreement was to diarise: [...] "I think we should hang our heads that we did not stand up to the bully of Europe... It may yet mean peace but at what price?" [...] He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war, including the introduction of conscription. On 8November 1938, he resigned his portfolio, having discovered that Joseph Lyons had established an inner cabinet from which he was excluded. Lyons' response in parliament to White's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP. White stood for the UAP's leadership after Lyons' death the following year but was eliminated early in the balloting, and Robert Menzies eventually became leader.|$|E

[...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs is that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once {{you get used to}} Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E
