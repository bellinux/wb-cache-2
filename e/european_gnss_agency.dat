40|$|There is a {{continuous}} and increasing demand for solutions, both software and hardware-based, that {{are able to}} productively handle underground utilities geospatial data. Innovative approaches that are based {{on the use of the}} European GNSS, Galileo and EGNOS, sensor technologies and LBS, are able to monitor, document and manage utility infrastructures’ data with an intuitive 3 D augmented visualisation and navigation/positioning technology. A software and hardware-based system called LARA, currently under develop- ment through a H 2020 co-funded project, aims at meeting that demand. The concept of LARA is to integrate the different innovative components of existing technologies in order to design and develop an integrated navigation/positioning and information system which coordinates GNSS, AR, 3 D GIS and geodatabases on a mobile platform for monitoring, documenting and managing utility infrastruc- tures on-site. The LARA system will guide utility field workers to locate the working area by helping them see beneath the ground, rendering the complexity of the 3 D models of the underground grid such as water, gas and electricity.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of advanced driver assistant system (ADAS) is to disburden the driver in complex traffic situations, thereby mainly increasing {{the safety of}} the driver and other road users and reducing the number of accidents. Automotive Urban Assist in particular aims to significantly reduce the number of urban road accidents and consequently the number of injured and killed people in road traffic. The better the ADAS perceives the environment as it would be perceived by the driver, the better the system can evaluate the situation and react appropriately. The static situation consists of the number of lanes, the driving direction, the existence of traffic lights, etc. This can be provided in form of attributed maps, which have to have sufficient accuracy in order to clearly identify lanes or the position of stop-lines. The dynamic situation, thus the oncoming traffic, the status of the traffic light, or the own position, has to be determined in real-time. The int eraction of various sensors is needed in order to acquire all necessary information. Thereby, a certain level of redundancy increases the level of integrity. Satellite navigation receivers are increasingly used as an additional sensor within different kinds of ADAS. Accuracy, availability, but above all reliability and integrity are important performance measures which have to be met by GNSS receivers in order to find their way into ADAS. The GNSS sensor provides the absolute position, velocity, and time reference for the integrated system, which is additionally connected to the existing on-board electronics and diagnostics. The GNSS sensor, moreover, is at the moment the only mean to relate the static situation stored in maps with the dynamic situation perceived. This makes implementing GNSS in ADAS interesting and essential.

40|$|Ionospheric scintillations are {{fluctuations}} in the phase and amplitude of the signals from GNSS satellites occurring when they cross regions of electron density irregularities in the ionosphere. Such disturbances can cause serious degradation on GNSS system performance, including integrity, accuracy and availability. The two indices internationally adopted to characterize ionospheric scintillations are: the amplitude scintillation index, S 4, which is the standard deviation of the received power normalized by its mean value, and the phase scintillation index, σΦ, which is the standard deviation of the de-trended carrier phase. At low latitudes scintillations occur very frequently and can be intense. This is because the low latitudes show a characteristic feature of the plasma density, known as the equatorial anomaly, EA, for which a plasma density enhancement is produced and seen as crests {{on either side of}} the magnetic equator. It is a region in which the electron density is considerably high and inhomogeneous, producing ionospheric irregularities causing scintillations. The upcoming solar maximum, which is expected to reach its peak around May 2013, occurs at a time when our reliance on high-precision GNSS (such as GPS, GLONASS and the forthcoming GALILEO) has reached unprecedented proportions. Understanding and monitoring of scintillations are essential, so that warnings and forecast information can be made available to GNSS end users, either for global system or local augmentation network administrators in order to guarantee the necessary levels of accuracy, integrity and availability of high precision and/or safety-of-life applications. Especially when facing severe geospatial perturbations, receiver-level mitigations are also needed to minimize adverse effects on satellite signals tracking availability and accuracy. In this context, the challenge of the CIGALA (Concept for Ionospheric scintillation mitiGAtion for professional GNSS in Latin America) project, co-funded by the <b>European</b> <b>GNSS</b> <b>Agency</b> (GSA) through the European 7 th Framework Program, is to understand the causes of ionospheric disturbances and model their effects in order to develop novel counter-measure techniques to be implemented in professional multi-frequency GNSS receivers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} mapKITE, a new mobile, {{simultaneous}} terrestrial and aerial, geodata collection and post-processing method. On one side, the method combines a terrestrial mobile mapping system (TMMS) with an unmanned aerial mapping one, both equipped with remote sensing payloads (at least, a nadir-looking visible-band {{camera in the}} UA) by means of which aerial and terrestrial geodata are acquired simultaneously. This tandem geodata acquisition system {{is based on a}} terrestrial vehicle (TV) and on an unmanned aircraft (UA) linked by a 'virtual tether', that is, a mechanism based on the real-time supply of UA waypoints by the TV. By means of the TV-to-UA tether, the UA follows the TV keeping a specific relative TV-to-UA spatial configuration enabling the simultaneous operation of both systems to obtain highly redundant and complementary geodata. On the other side, mapKITE presents a novel concept for geodata post-processing favoured by the rich geometrical aspects derived from the mapKITE tandem simultaneous operation. The approach followed for sensor orientation and calibration of the aerial images captured by the UA inherits the principles of Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO) and adds the pointing-and-scaling photogrammetric measurement of a distinctive element observed in every UA image, which is a coded target mounted {{on the roof of the}} TV. By means of the TV navigation system, the orientation of the TV coded target is performed and used in the post-processing UA image orientation approach as a Kinematic Ground Control Point (KGCP). The geometric strength of a mapKITE ISO network is therefore high as it counts with the traditional tie point image measurements, static ground control points, kinematic aerial control and the new point-and-scale measurements of the KGCPs. With such a geometry, reliable system and sensor orientation and calibration and eventual further reduction of the number of traditional ground control points is feasible. The different technical concepts, challenges and breakthroughs behind mapKITE are presented in this paper, such as the TV-to-UA virtual tether and the use of KGCP measurements for UA sensor orientation. In addition, the use in mapKITE of new European GNSS signals such as the Galileo E 5 AltBOC is discussed.

40|$|Ionospheric scintillations {{are known}} to be rather {{challenging}} in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers. The scintillation effects include rapid variations in signal phase and amplitude, which may hinder the receiver to acquire and track the signal and may cause a loss of lock at GNSS receiver. This thesis focuses on the scintillation effects on the <b>European</b> <b>GNSS</b> namely, Galileo. Abrupt phase variations during transmission cause deep power fades called canonical fading, half cycle slips and frequency unlock. Phase locked loop designs that are currently available helps in reducing the scintillation effects to some extent, though this is complicated when scintillation is severe. This thesis focuses on investigating some of the scintillation effects on Galileo signal during acquisition. The considered performance criteria are the detection performance and the root mean square error at the receiver. For implementing this task, this thesis uses two toolboxes, namely Cornell Scintillation toolbox for generating synthetic scintillation time histories and TUT MBOC tracking model for simulating and studying the scintillation effects at the receiver. Cornell Scintillation toolbox generates synthetic amplitude and phase time histories based on two input parameters namely, scintillation intensity and decorrelation time that show how rapidly the signal amplitude and phase change. TUT MBOC acquisition and tracking simulator generates Galileo E 1 signal that undergoes MBOC modulation and it is transmitted through multipath Nakagami-m fading channels. The thesis work focused on merging the scintillation time histories generated by Cornell scintillation toolbox with the TUT MBOC acquisition tracking algorithm, by adding the scintillation to fading channel. By calculating the Line of Sight (LOS) phase delay, the acquisition of the received signal is performed with and without scintillations.

In the frame of this project several tasks have been achieved, in particular the deployment of a network of scintillation receivers (Novatel + Septentrio + GISMO) mainly at low and high latitudes, the development of a real time Central Archiving and Processing Facility (CAPF) and the development of dedicated processors to generate user oriented outputs for TEC, scintillation, and space weather issues. This project, in its new phase started in 2014, is moving forward with an improved and updated scope, addressing in addition to general ionospheric monitoring, the generation of dedicated products and reports to EGNOS system evolution, international collaboration in related ionospheric topics including feasibility studies in Africa. The main new features are: an upgraded data archiving system providing improved accessibility, the integration of data from SAGAIE network from French Space Agency, CNES and the exploitation of its data for new products, new station deployment in regions of interest (mainly in West and Central Africa and in high latitudes in Europe), and the upgrade and development of new products allowing better analysis of geophysical conditions during periods of compromised system performance and service. As an example, the Along Arc TEC Rate (AATR index) is computed routinely, as it {{has proven to be a}} clear indicator of ionospheric activity that degrades SBAS system performance. In addition, Monitor already produces VTEC maps (obtained using various techniques and algorithms), several space weather indicators including solar flare detection, ROTI maps, indices related to the quality of measurements and scintillation analysis tools.

Several case studies will highlight significant EGNOS events for this purpose.

Indeed, thanks to the accuracy of the ionospheric corrections provided, WARTK users have available in real-time an extra constraint per satellite between the carrier phase ambiguities, which helps solve them quickly. Once such ambiguities have been solved, the GNSS user obtains navigation accurate to within 20 cm at the 95 th percentile (about 10 cm RMS). Moreover, this precise positioning is achieved in a few minutes (with two frequency signals) or in a single epoch, after initial convergence of the tropospheric delay (with three frequency signals), even up to hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest reference station. While previous WARTK research has been devoted to implementing the concept and assessing its feasibility, considering in particular the accuracy achievable, the work reported in this paper focused on consolidating the results by analyzing a large and representative data set, and on deeper analysis of the integrity issue. It was carried out {{in the context of the}} Multi-constellation Regional System (MRS) project, within the <b>European</b> Space <b>Agency</b> <b>GNSS</b> Evolution Programme, with the aim of designing a high accuracy service for GPS and/or Galileo. Three months of actual data, from more than 25 permanent GPS stations in Europe, have been processed (some of them as a roving user), for high-, mid- and low-solar cycle conditions (in 2002, 2004 and 2006 respectively). In addition, several ionospheric storms occurred during the selected periods, with Dst values reaching up to − 150 nT. Results based on these data show that user domain integrity was maintained for baselines of up to 400 km. At the 95 th percentile, the daily horizontal and vertical position errors were 20 and 30 cm, respectively, and the corresponding protection levels were about 1 and 2 m. The convergence time was around 5 minutes with actual GPS constellation data. The benefits of using a multi-constellation system were also studied, with simulated GPS and three-frequency Galileo data, showing that it is possible to reduce the convergence time to a few seconds.
