25|$|Any {{habitual}} pattern {{which is}} interrupted unexpectedly will cause sudden and light trance. The handshake {{is a particularly}} good pattern to interrupt because the formality of a handshake is a widely understood set of social rules. Since <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> it would be impolite {{to comment on the}} quality of a handshake, regardless of how strange it may be, the subject is obliged to embark on an inner search (known as a transderivational search, a universal and compelling type of trance) to identify the meaning or purpose of the subverted pattern.|$|E
25|$|Salma de la Navidad, {{a friend}} of Willow's, is having problems: her brother Nicky has {{disappeared}} and {{is believed to be}} joining a local Sunnydale gang called the Latin Cobras. Salma's also got a black shadowy nothingness that Buffy can sense but can barely fight. Meanwhile, in LA, Angel is tied down by a case where his client is wrongfully accused of murder by crooked cops while Cordelia discovers a pack of pre-teens who revere vampires and have been promised eternal life by a vampire. Buffy's work takes her to LA along with Willow to the de la Navidad household where the same black shadow continues to attack Salma. When Salma suddenly disappears as does Kayley (one of the vampire lovers) <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> something is up. After an explosion of oil fields, caused by Nicky, in Sunnydale, Riley rushes to LA where himself, Buffy and Angel have to work together to solve the disappearances and to calm down the gang warfare going on in LA.|$|E

500|$|On 1 December, Benfica won {{its first}} league match {{in their new}} stadium, beating Rio Ave by 2–0. After the match, Camacho defended his team to the press by saying [...] "Eusébio's team is gone." [...] A week later, the team {{defeated}} Paços de Ferreira away, with João Pereira scoring two goals. Because Porto had lost points, Benfica were now only six points {{from the top of}} the league. On the 13th, Benfica won their fifth match in a row, beating Braga at home. After the game, Camacho angrily refuted any idea that Benfica did not play accordingly to expectations: [...] "A poor performance? That's not what I saw. In football there are two teams. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that,</b> against Benfica, all teams give their best, and we suffer that in the first half, because Braga played like every other team here. It is like the story of the bottle, for the optimist it is half full; for the pessimist, it is half empty." [...] On the same day, they were drawn with Rosenborg in the upcoming round of the UEFA Cup. The following Wednesday, Benfica progressed through the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, with Luisão scoring a single goal in an away win against Académica. The final game of the month came on the 21st, with a 3–0 win to Estrela da Amadora. Two goals within the first ten minutes allowed the team to comfortably manage the remaining time. Camacho later said that Benfica could have scored six or seven goals. This was the team's seventh win in a row, the longest streak of consecutive wins in Camacho's time at Benfica.|$|E
500|$|Gens {{himself has}} been called [...] "one of the most {{controversial}} Jewish ghetto leaders". Chaim Lazar, a member of the FPO, wrote of Gens that [...] "It may be charged that his course was harmful, but <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> he was never a traitor. All that he did during his tenure as Chief of the Ghetto was for his people". Yitzhak Arad, in his history of the Vilnius Ghetto, says that Gens [...] "erred in his fundamental conception– that the German administration regarded the existence of the ghetto and its inhabitants vital for economic reasons" [...] and that [...] "the policy laid down by Jacob Gens {{was the only one that}} afforded hope and some prospect of survival". Vadim Altskan, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that [...] "...Holocaust historiography treated people such as... Jacob Gens... as instruments of destruction in the hands of the Nazi killing machine.... Applied retrospectively, these charges for the most part are judgmental and add very little to our understanding of the events. Neither Jewish functionaries nor 'ordinary' Jews had any practical or psychological experience in dealing with the grim reality of the Nazi occupation, because never before in their long history of persecution had the Jews experienced an assault of such magnitude and careful design." [...] Regarding the charge of collaborating with the Germans, Dawidowicz opined, [...] "to say that [...] 'cooperated' or 'collaborated' with the Germans is semantic confusion and historical misrepresentation". The Israeli Zionist poet Nathan Alterman investigated the history of the Vilnius Ghetto, including interviewing survivors such as Abba Kovner, and stated [...] "Had I been in the ghetto, I would have been on the side of the Judenrat." ...|$|E

500|$|Hitchens writes [...] "the biggest fake miracle {{staged in}} human history was {{the claim that the}} Soviet Union was a new {{civilisation}} of equality, peace, love, truth, science and progress. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> it was a prison, a slum, a return to primitive barbarism, a kingdom of lies where scientists and doctors feared offending the secret police, and that its elite were corrupt and lived in secret luxury". He then cites Walter Duranty's denying the existence of the great Ukrainian famine, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb's [...] acceptance that the 1937 Moscow show trials were [...] "genuine criminal prosecutions". Hitchens then examines Lenin's suppression of religion in the Soviet Union, which included making the teaching of religion to children punishable by the death penalty and the creation of an antireligious organisation of Soviet workers. Hitchens begins Chapter 13 by quoting William Henry Chamberlin: [...] "In Russia, the world is witnessing the first effort to destroy completely any belief in supernatural interpretation of life", and then examines some consequences of this, including intolerance of religion, terror, and the persecution of priests and bishops at the Solovetsky concentration camp. Hitchens asserts that in the Soviet Union [...] "the regime's institutional loathing for the teaching of religion, and its desire to eradicate it, survived every doctrinal detour and swerve". In the final chapter, Hitchens analyses a number of his brother's arguments, and contends that [...] "the coincidence in instinct, taste, and thought between my brother and the Bolsheviks and their sympathisers is striking and undeniable". He then records how his brother nominated the [...] "apostle of revolutionary terror" [...] Leon Trotsky for an edition of the BBC radio series Great Lives; praised Trotsky for his [...] "moral courage"; and declared that one of Lenin's great achievements was [...] "to create a secular Russia". Hitchens speculates that his brother remained sympathetic towards Bolshevism and is still hostile towards the things it extirpated, including monarchy, tradition, and faith. He ends the chapter by claiming a form of militant secularism is becoming established in Britain, and that [...] "The Rage Against God is loose".|$|E
2500|$|Antonioni {{wrote that}} the film was [...] "expressed through images in which I hope to show not the birth of an {{erroneous}} sentiment, but rather {{the way in which}} we go astray in our sentiments. Because as I have said, our moral values are old. Our myths and conventions are old. And <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> they are indeed old and outmoded. Yet we respect them." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{be part of}} the Mafia {{is highly}} {{desirable}} for many street criminals. [...] Mafiosi receive a great deal of respect, for <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> to offend a mafioso is to risk lethal retribution from him or his colleagues. [...] Mafiosi have an easier time getting away with crimes, negotiating deals, and demanding privileges. [...] A full member also gains more freedom to participate in certain rackets which the Mafia controls (particularly protection racketeering).|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Fanning caused {{controversy}} when {{he chose}} to become a judge on television talent show You're a Star, to choose that year's act to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. He explained his decision: It’s indefensible. I just can’t defend this at all. It’s Eurovision for God’s sake. It’s all shite, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that.</b> But I just don't care. I'm doing it for a laugh. Of course I'm going to get people slagging me off, but I'm used to all that. [...] I just thought, why not do it?" [...] he says. [...] "I've done everything else at this stage, including the Mercury Music Prize, IMRO Showcases and battle of the bands contests {{up and down the}} country. When I did 2TV from 1995 until 2000 I presided over the worst five years in 50 years of pop music history. It was all Boyzone videos and I'd slag them all to death.

2500|$|In 2001, {{the film}} was paid homage again in [...] "Charmed Noir", a seventh-season episode of Charmed. In it, two {{siblings}} at Magic School write an immersive novel in which all characters are seeking the [...] "Burmese Falcon". The boys become inadvertently trapped in the novel for decades, though time basically stands still for them. Paige Matthews, played by Rose McGowan, and an associate become trapped in the book as well many years after the boys do. Matthews asks {{one of the boys}} if the Burmese Falcon is [...] "Like the Maltese Falcon?" [...] in an attempt to understand the situation in which she finds herself. The boy replies that <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the Maltese Falcon was a fake, and that the Burmese Falcon is the genuine article.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. However, she pointed out that [...] "I’m having trouble with Merida’s entry into OUAT season five because I’m just not that invested in the character. Not that she isn’t a plucky little heroine—oh God, she’s plucky!—but because her own backstory and mythology doesn’t offer is a lot. Snow is now a terrible character, but her story was always rich with possibilities: the apple, the mriror, the queen, the hunter, even the dwarves. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> story, even if they don’t know they know it. But if you didn’t check out Brave in the theater a few summers ago—which you probably wouldn’t do unless you were a small child or had a small child yourself— you would {{have no idea where}} there are bears running around all over the place this episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|Croke Park's stadium {{director}} Peter McKenna questioned why Louth manager Peter Fitzpatrick {{had walked}} onto the pitch to ask the referee about the decision. Gaelic Players Association (GPA) chief executive Dessie Farrell said: [...] "What went on last Sunday was a PR disaster for us all". The National Referees Committee gave a negative response {{to the idea of}} goal-line technology being used in future. Retired referee John Bannon said [...] "No one deserves to be attacked, either verbally or physically, especially in Croke Park. [...] This attitude still remains part of the GAA's culture, it has never been rooted out". Tyrone County Board (from where the referee originated) sympathised with the Sludden but said the crowd's reaction was [...] "unbelievable". Liam O'Neill, a candidate for the GAA presidency in 2012, later said: [...] "Quite simply, there should have been a re-fixture for that game. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that.</b> Everyone knows a wrong was perpetrated".|$|E
2500|$|For many decades, Brixton {{has had a}} {{reputation}} for cannabis use and the BBC has quoted a local resident as saying [...] "People have always smoked cannabis in Brixton – <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that,</b> people have walked down the street smoking spliffs for years." [...] This reputation was amplified by the [...] "softly softly" [...] police approach to cannabis that was piloted in Brixton in 2001 to 2005. Concerns were raised about [...] "drug tourism" [...] to the area. The [...] "softly-softly" [...] pilot occurred {{in the context of a}} wider debate in Britain about the classification of cannabis. Despite the pilot being stopped and replaced by a [...] "no deal" [...] policy, the Metropolitan Police was in favour of a reclassification of cannabis from class B to class C. Cannabis was officially reclassified in Britain from a class B down to a class C drug in early 2004. In January 2009 the UK government reclassified cannabis back to a class B drug.|$|E

5000|$|Running the {{committee}} was seen as politically risky for Kerry, and one that his advisors recommended he not do.

25|$|Naturally, in America <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> from 1846 to 1861 a {{free trade}} system prevailed, and that Representative Morrill carried his {{protectionist}} tariff through Congress only in 1861, after the rebellion had already broken out.

2500|$|During {{his speech}} in Vienna on 1 March 2013 at a United Nations event, Turkish Prime {{minister}} Recep Tayyip Erdoğan devoted to {{dialogue between the}} West and Islam, decrying the rising racism in Europe {{and the fact that}} many Muslims [...] "who live in countries other than their own" [...] often face harsh discrimination. Erdoğan described Zionism as [...] "a crime against humanity" [...] saying, [...] "It is necessary that we must consider—just like Zionism, or anti-Semitism, or fascism—Islamophobia." [...] In an interview to the Euronews, Shimon Peres argued that Erdoğan's statements are based on ignorance and they raise the flames of hatred. On March 20, Erdoğan began an official visit to Denmark with an effort to clarify his remarks he made on February 27 at a UN conference in Vienna referring to Zionism as a crime against humanity. [...] "Let no one misunderstand what I said. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> my criticism [...] focuses on some critical issues. It's directed especially toward Israeli policies on Gaza," [...] Erdoğan {{said in an interview with}} Politiken, a Danish newspaper. Erdoğan claimed February comments were not anti-Semitic but rather a criticism of Israel's policies.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|Tsarnaev was {{the subject}} of a cover story for an August 2013 issue of Rolling Stone {{entitled}} [...] "The Bomber: How a Popular, Promising Student Was Failed by His Family, Fell into Radical Islam and Became a Monster." [...] The magazine drew large amounts of criticism for the flattering photo of Tsarnaev used for the issue's cover. Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote that the cover [...] "rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment". Massachusetts State Police sergeant Sean Murphy stated that [...] "glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine." [...] The New York Times used the same photo on their front page in May 2013, but did not draw criticism. Rolling Stone columnist Matt Taibbi criticized those who took offense at the cover, arguing that their offense-taking was the result of their associating Rolling Stone with glamor instead of news, stating that The New York Times did not draw the criticism that Rolling Stone did, [...] "because everyone knows the Times is a news organization. Not <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> about Rolling Stone... because many people out there understandably do not know that Rolling Stone is also a hard-news publication." ...|$|E
