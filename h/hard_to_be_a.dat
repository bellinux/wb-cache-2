5|$|Jean-Claude Mézières {{himself has}} worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for {{director}} Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René Barjavel's novel La Nuit des temps (The Ice People). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> God for director Peter Fleischmann. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières' concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in Mézières Extras.|$|E
5|$|In October 1985, Mézières was {{contacted}} by the German director Peter Fleischmann who proposed to adapt Russians Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's 1964 novel <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> God into a film. This {{was to be the}} first major German-Soviet co-production. Mézières travelled to Moscow to join the production team and also to Uzbekistan where it was proposed to shoot the film. Travelling from there to Munich, he produced several concept drawings and paintings over a three-month period before the project was suspended due to funding difficulties. At this point Mézières left the production and returned to France. Filming was eventually scheduled to begin in April 1986 in Kiev and Mézières re-joined the production, creating storyboards for some scenes. However, at this time the Chernobyl disaster occurred only 100km from Kiev and production was again halted. The film was eventually finished in 1989, but Mézières' concepts were barely used. Again, many of Mézières' designs were later published in Les Extras de Mézières.|$|E

25|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{was started}} by Ivan Yefremov's utopian novel Andromeda Nebula (1957). He was soon followed by brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, who explored darker themes and social satire in their Noon Universe novels, such as <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> God (1964) and Prisoners of Power (1969), {{as well as in}} their science fantasy trilogy Monday Begins on Saturday (1964). A good share of Soviet science fiction was aimed at children. Probably the best known was Kir Bulychov, who created Alisa Selezneva (1965-2003), a children's space adventure series about a teenage girl from the future.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s Germany {{produced}} {{a number of}} critically acclaimed high-budget science fiction and horror films. Metropolis by director Fritz Lang is credited {{as one of the}} most influential science fiction films ever made.

In the second half of the 20th century, East Germany also became a major science fiction film producer, often in a collaboration with fellow Eastern Bloc countries.

25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E

Harry Maslin and Carlos Alomar have claimed that they never recorded the song during the Cherokee sessions, while Tony Visconti believes that the song most likely consisted of overdubs to a track originally cut at Olympic and Island Studios during the Diamond Dogs sessions, with Aynsley Dunbar on drums, Herbie Flowers on bass and Mike Garson on keyboards. The song would later be re-released on The Best of David Bowie 1974/1979.|$|E

People {{magazine}} called the video [...] "humptastic", referring to Simpson's progressive sexual image from her previous videos, while an editor for The Irish Independent wrote that Simpson looked [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] in the video. Billboards Chuck Taylor also reviewed the video positively, writing the video will [...] "add to the allure" [...] of Simpson becoming a [...] "sex-symbol". Similarly, Melissa Ruggeri of The Richmond Times-Dispatch also gave a positive review, writing {{that the term}} [...] "Irresistible" [...] fitted the video. However, Siobhan Grogan of NME magazine wrote that Simpson has no apprehension [...] "about 'forgetting' most of her clothes for the video". Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News criticized Simpson's ungraceful performance on the video, which was echoed by Jon Bream and Chris Riemenschneider of The Star Tribune who felt Simpson was trying too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] in the video. The video reached number two on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL) countdown, and number seventeen on MuchMusic Canada's Top 30 Countdown. In the So So Def remix music video, which featured additional direction from Cameron Casey and followed the same plot as the unmixed version, scenes of Lil' Bow Wow and Dupri rapping are intercut with scenes of Simpson performing the song. The So So Def remix version of the video premiered on BET's 106 & Park in July 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Falling coconut {{injuries}} were {{featured in the}} American television series Gilligan's Island. [...] A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut {{hit him in the}} nose. [...] Actor Bob Denver explained the success of the series as follows: [...] "Little kids seem to love it. [...] It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut." [...] When Denver died, the show's creator Sherwood Schwartz said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: [...] "A lot of people don't think it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> actor where all you have <b>to</b> do <b>is</b> react <b>to</b> <b>a</b> falling coconut." [...] In the film Cast Away, the stranded character played by Tom Hanks is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound.|$|R

2500|$|Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 3.4/5 rating in 1991. UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that [...] "this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, {{but most of all}} simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Nintendo game.

40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{enemy of}} diversity. Most Americans {{recognize}} diversity {{as one of}} the nation’s proudest attributes. Beyond that, however, there is confusion over the term’s meaning. No matter how often people say the word, or how strongly they believe in it, they continue to ignore the way diversity has become an all-embracing concept. The term “diversity” has become a code word that fails to define precisely what it allegedly exalts and what exactly <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished by those who extol its virtues. The elasticity of the term “diversity” has masked many kinds of questionable conduct. Administrators have been invoking “diversity” without openly acknowledging that diversity has become “untethered from integration” to the point of becoming “integration’s rival. ” Whatever the Supreme Court decides about the data regarding the effects of diversity on students’ academic performance, it <b>is</b> not likely <b>to</b> satisfy all of our college administrators, faculty, and students...|$|R
