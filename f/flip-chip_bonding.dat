40|$|For {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) ultrasound imaging, {{connecting elements}} of a two-dimensional (2 D) transducer array to the imaging system's front-end electronics is a challenge {{because of the large}} number of array elements and the small element size. To compactly connect the transducer array with electronics, we <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bond</b> a 2 D 16 x 16 -element capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array to a custom-designed integrated circuit (IC). Through-wafer interconnects are used to connect the CMUT elements on the top side of the array with <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bond</b> pads on the back side. The IC provides a 25 -V pulser and a transimpedance preamplifier to each element of the array. For each of three characterized devices, the element yield is excellent (99 to 100 % of the elements are functional). Center frequencies range from 2. 6 MHz to 5. 1 MHz. For pulse-echo operation, the average - 6 -dB fractional bandwidth is as high as 125 %. Transmit pressures normalized to the face of the transducer are as high as 339 kPa and input-referred receiver noise is typically 1. 2 to 2. 1 mPa/root Hz.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} {{high energy}} physics experiments, silicon detectors {{are essential for}} recording the trajectory of new particles generated by multiple simultaneous collisions. Modern particle tracking systems may feature 100 million channels, or pixels, which need to be individually connected to read-out chains. Silicon pixel detectors are typically connected to readout chips by <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bonding</b> using solder bumps. High-quality electro-mechanical flip-chip interconnects minimizes the number of dead read-out channels in the particle tracking system. Furthermore, the detector modules must endure handling during installation and withstand heat generation and cooling during operation. Silicon pixel detector modules were constructed by <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bonding</b> 16 readout chips to a single sensor.

40|$|LEDs are {{subjected}} to environments with high moisture in many applications. In this paper, the experiments reveal photometric and colorimetric degradation at high humidity. Corresponding spectral power analysis and parameter extraction indicate that the <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bonded</b> LED samples show accelerated chip failure compared to the conventionally bonded samples. The chip-related failure induces greater heat accumulation, which correlates {{with the increase in}} heating power observed in the package. However, the temperature rise and thermal resistance for the <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bonded</b> LEDs do not increase substantially as compared to the conventionally bonded LEDs. This is because the junction temperature can be reduced with a flip-chip die-bonding configuration where the heat generated in the LED chip is dissipated effectively onto the AlN substrate, thereby reducing the increase in temperature rise and thermal resistance. The experimental results are supported by evaluation of the derivative structure functions. In addition, as the thermal resistance of the LED package varies with different humidity levels, {{there is a need to}} specify the conditions of humidity in data sheets as LED manufacturers routinely specify a universal thermal resistance value under a fixed operating condition...|$|R

So in a standard flip-chip package the strong mechanical coupling by the solder bumps would lead to stress in the sensor chip, which is unacceptable for piezoresistive pressure sensors. To solve this problem, in the new packaging technology the chip is <b>flip-chip</b> <b>bonded</b> on compliant springs to decouple chip and package. As {{the first step of}} the packaging process an under bump metallization (UBM) is patterned on the sensor wafer. Then solder bumps are printed.

Due to the compliance of the springs, packaging stress is induced into the sensor chip. As sources of residual stress the UBM and the solder bumps on the sensor chip were identified. Different coefficients of thermal expansion of the sil icon chip, the UBM and the solder lead to plastic straining of the aluminum metallization between UBM and chip. As a consequence the measurement accuracy is limited by a temperature hysteresis. The influence of the chip geometry, e. g., the thickness of the chip or the depth of the cavity, on the hysteresis was investigated by simulation and measurements.
