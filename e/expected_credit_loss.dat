The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) finalised its International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 Financial Instruments project in July 2014.

Redressing the research gap, this study investigates whether significant influence had been exerted by interest groups on the IASB during the development of all three <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> model proposals of the IFRS 9 impairment phase. By conducting content analysis on 327 comment letters, this study did not find significant influence by any particular interest group across five out of the six key changes identified amongst the proposals (the 2009 exposure draft, 2011 supplementary document and 2013 exposure draft). Additional analysis conducted on the comment letters, the IASB expert advisory panel summary document and the two IASB outreach summary documents identified that interest group inputs had played an important role in shaping the proposed <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> models, making them more operational, less complex and productive of more comparable financial information (within and across entities) than the preceding proposals.

Limiting the trading activities accounted for by fair values may reduce the pro-cyclicality. However, it cannot eliminate the impact of fair values in a liquidity crisis.

40|$|Ambivalence in the {{regulatory}} definition of capital adequacy for credit risk has recently steered {{the financial services}} industry to collateral loan obligations (CLOs) as an important balance sheet management tool. CLOs represent a specialised form of Asset-Backed Securitisation (ABS), with investors acquiring a structured claim on the interest proceeds generated from a portfolio of bank loans {{in the form of}} tranches with different seniority. By way of modelling Merton-type risk-neutral asset returns of contingent claims on a multi-asset portfolio of corporate loans in a CLO transaction, we analyse the optimal design of loan securitisation from the perspective of credit risk in potential collateral default. We propose a pricing model that draws on a careful simulation of expected loan loss based on parametric bootstrapping through extreme value theory (EVT). The analysis illustrates the dichotomous effect of loss cascading, as the most junior tranche of CLO transactions exhibits a distinctly different default tolerance compared to the remaining tranches.

The authors' analysis considers a network of three banks, in a settlement system similar to the LVTS T 2. Although it is widely believed that closure of one bank is imminent, the exact timing of the closure - during or after the settlement cycle - is uncertain. The other two banks face an "open or close" choice regarding their BCLs to the problem participant. Based on the expected net payoff of each choice, which includes the value of network externalities, the analysis shows that, when the <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> is sufficiently low, an open-BCL pure-strategy Nash equilibrium can exist and can be Pareto efficient. This result dispels the generality of the frequent assertion that participants in the LVTS T 2 will close their BCLs to a participant that is subject to imminent closure.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> (ECL) model with supervisory rules and discusses potential implications for financial stability in the European Union. Compared to the incurred loss approach of IAS 39, the IFRS 9 ECL model incorporates earlier and larger impairment allowances and is more closely aligned with regulatory expected loss. The earlier recognition of credit losses will reduce the build-up of loss overhangs and the overstatement of regulatory capital. In addition, extended disclosure requirements are likely to contribute to more effective market discipline. Through these channels IFRS 9 might enhance financial stability. However, due to the reliance on point-in-time estimates of the main input parameters (probability of default and loss given default) IFRS 9 ECLs will increase the volatility of regulatory capital for some banks. Furthermore, the ECL model provides significant room for managerial discretion. Bank supervisors might {{play an important role in}} the implementation of IFRS 9, but too much supervisory intervention bears the risk of introducing a prudential bias into loan loss accounting that compromises the integrity of financial reporting. Overall, the potential benefits of the standard will crucially depend on its proper and consistent application across jurisdictions...|$|E

To the best of knowledge, no literature has investigated to determine the factors determining loan loss provisions on commercial banks in Malaysia. The present factors being used to determine loan loss provisions do not accurately reflect the <b>expected</b> occurrence of <b>credit</b> <b>losses.</b> As a consequence, the banks do not capture loss expectations and do not continuously reassess changes in the loss expectations as the conditions affecting their borrowers may change and in financial reporting they do not represent relevantly and faithfully their true underlying credit risk conditions.

40|$|The recent {{debate over}} the {{pro-cyclical}} effects of capital regulation has overlooked the important role that bank loan loss provisions play in the overall minimum capital regulatory framework. Inadequate assessment of <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> leads to under-provisioning and to the shortage of loan loss reserves at times of crisis. As a consequence, capital has to offset both expected and unexpected losses, aggravating {{the negative impact of}} minimum capital requirements over the economic activity during recessions.

The often unsatisfactory institutional arrangement for loan loss provisioning may be seen as an effort to mitigate an agency problems between bank stakeholders (outsiders versus insiders). We test our hypothesis over a sample of 1176 large commercial banks, 372 of which from non-G 10 countries, over the period 1988 - 1999. After controlling for different country specific macroeconomic and institutional features, we find robust evidence that the relationship between loan loss provisioning and banks' pre-provision income shows the desirable positive sign for G 10 banks. The same sign is, instead, negative for non-G 10 banks, which on average provision too little in good times and are forced to increase provisions in bad times.

40|$|During the {{financial}} crisis, the delayed recognition of credit losses on loans {{and other financial}} instruments {{was identified as a}} weakness in existing incurred loss model of impairment stated by International Accounting Standards (IAS) 39, because it is believed that this delay might generate pro-cyclical effects. In response to the recommendations of G 20, Financial Crisis Advisory Group (FCAG), and other international bodies, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has undertaken, since 2009, {{as a part of the}} project to replace IAS 39, a project (partially shared with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)) aimed at introducing an expected loss model of impairment. Within the scope of this subset project, the IASB has previously issued two exposure documents proposing models to account for expected credit losses: an exposure draft (ED) Financial Instrument: Amortized Cost and Impairment, published in November 2009, and a supplementary document (SD) Financial Instrument: Impairment, published jointly with the FASB in January 2011. However, neither of the two proposals received strong support from interested parties.

40|$|Recent {{debate about}} the {{pro-cyclical}} effects of bank capital requirements, has ignored the important role that bank loan loss provisions play in the overall framework of minimum capital regulation. It is frequently observed that under-provisioning, due to inadequate assessment of <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>losses,</b> aggravates the negative effect of minimum capital requirements during recessions, because capital must absorb both expected, and unexpected losses. Moreover, when expected losses are properly reflected in lending rates, but not in provisioning practices, fluctuations in bank earnings magnify true oscillations in bank profitability. The relative agency problems faced by different stakeholders, may help explain the prevailing, and often unsatisfactory institutional arrangements. The authors test their hypotheses {{with a sample of}} 1, 176 large commercial banks - 372 of them in non-G 10 countries - for the period 1988 - 99. After controlling for different country-specific macroeconomic, and institutional features, they find robust evidence among G 10 banks, of a positive association between loan loss provisions, and banks'pre-provision income. Such evidence is not confirmed for non-G 10 banks, which on average, provision too little in good times, and are forced to increase provisions in bad times. The econometric evidence shows that the protection of outsiders'claims - the claims of minority shareholders in common law countries, and of fiscal authorities in countries with high public debt - on bank income, has negative effects on the level of bank provisions.

40|$|After {{the release}} of the final {{accounting}} standards for impairment in July 2014 by the IASB, banks will face the next significant methodological challenge after Basel 2. In this paper, first methodological thoughts are presented, and ways how to approach underlying questions are proposed. It starts with a detailed discussion of the structural conservatism in the final standard. The exposure value iACV(c) (idealized Amortized Cost Value), as originally introduced in the Exposure Draft 2009 (ED 2009), will be interpreted as economic value under amortized cost accounting and provides the valuation benchmark under IFRS 9. Consequently, iACV(c) can be used to quantify conservatism (ie potential hidden reserves) in the actual implementation of the final standard and to separate operational side-effects caused by the local implementation from actual credit risk impacts. The second part continues with a quantification of <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> based on Impact of Risk(c) instead of traditional cost of risk measures. An objective framework is suggested which allows for improved testing of forward looking credit risk estimates during credit cycles. This framework will prove useful to mitigate overly pro-cyclical provisioning and to reduce earnings volatility. Finally, an LGD monitoring and backtesting approach, applicable under regulatory requirements and accounting standards as well, is proposed. On basis of the NPL Dashboard, part of the Impact of Risk(c) framework, specific key risk indicators are introduced that allow for a detailed assessment of collections performance versus LGD in in NPL portfolio (bucket 3).

40|$|In banking practice, rating {{transition}} matrices {{have become}} the standard approach of deriving multi-year probabilities of default (PDs) from one-year PDs, with the latter normally being available from Basel ratings. Rating transition matrices have gained in importance with the newly adopted IFRS 9 accounting standard. Here, the multi-year PDs {{can be used to}} calculate the so-called <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> (ECL) over the entire lifetime of relevant credit assets. A typical approach for estimating the rating transition matrices relies on calculating empirical rating migration counts and frequencies from rating history data. However, for small portfolios this approach often leads to zero counts and high count volatility, which makes the estimations unreliable and volatile, and can also produce counter-intuitive prediction patterns. This paper proposes a structural model which overcomes these problems. We retort to a plausible assumption of an autoregressive mean-reverting specification for the underlying ability-to-pay process. With only three parameters, this sparse process can describe well an entire typical rating transition matrix, provided the one-year PDs of the rating classes are specified (e. g. in the rating master scale). The transition probabilities produced by the structural approach are well-behaved. The approach reduces significantly the statistical degrees of freedom of the estimated transition probabilities, which makes the rating transition matrix significantly more reliable for small portfolios. The approach can be applied to data with as few as 50 observed rating transitions. Moreover, the approach can be efficiently applied for data consisting of continuous (undiscretized) PDs. In the IFRS 9 context, the approach offers an additional merit of an easy way to account for the macroeconomic adjustments, which are required by the IFRS 9 accounting standard...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{widespread}} {{turmoil in}} the banking sector has renewed the notion that improper credit risk management {{continues to be the}} catalyst for serious banking problems. The Australian banking sector emerged relatively unscathed from recent global turmoil, providing an interesting setting for research. This thesis investigates the credit risk management practice of Australian banks’ loan portfolios from a regulatory perspective by examining regulatory loan-loss provisioning, regulatory capital, and regulatory stress-testing in Australia. Findings suggest the potential for Australian banks to under-provision when faced with pressure to raise capital ratios. IRB banks, on the other hand, report regulatory provisions in line with expected loss estimates as intended under the Basel II capital framework. Australian bank supervisors are encouraged to remain vigilant when assessing bank capital adequacy by paying particular attention to the sufficiency of bank regulatory provisioning practices as a reserve against <b>expected</b> <b>credit</b> <b>losses.</b> This thesis finds Australian banks target a level of regulatory capital above the imposed regulatory minimum, with quarterly speed of adjustment coefficients of 19 and 15 per cent for total and tier 1 capital ratios, respectively. Bank risk, size and ROE are found to be significant determinants of Australian bank capital buffers and Basel II is found to have increased bank capital buffers. Findings suggest a positive relationship exists between the business cycle and Australian bank capital buffers, interpreted to be a countercyclical effect and results indicate bank-specific regulatory imposed PCRs are having their intended effect on capital ratios. An investigation into current regulatory stress-testing practice reveals that variation in the performance between banks is widely disregarded. A simulation experiment suggests that once key stress-testing variables are decomposed from mean values into their empirically fitted distributions, the increase in average banking system losses is substantial. Both the average and worst performing group of banks suffer a significantly greater magnitude of loss. Under a severe stress scenario of a 30 per cent decline in the property index and a 10 per cent default rate, failing to decompose the mean results in an underestimation of average bank losses of 1. 86 per cent of total assets. The worst performing group of banks have losses underestimated by a total of 2. 32 per cent of total assets, a substantial amount of loss with significant implications for current regulatory stress-testing practice. This thesis provides insights into the credit risk management practices of a banking sector which, in recent times, has outperformed global counterparts. The final implication of the findings of this thesis is relevant for all authorities with vested interest in the resilience of worldwide banking systems. For proper management of credit risk, regulatory provisioning, regulatory capital and regulatory stress-testing cannot be assessed in isolation, a simultaneous assessment is essential. This thesis provides an essential step in promoting a greater awareness of the interrelations between these three components in the Australian banking system...|$|R

It will depend importantly on the credit quality distribution of banks' loan portfolios and on the precise way in which they calculate expected and unexpected losses. Sensitivity analysis, including that based on a range of hypothetical distributions for banks' loan portfolios, shows the potential for a substantial increase in implied volatility. Moreover, if historical relationships are a good indicator of the future, changes in required capital and provisions for commercial and industrial, interbank, and sovereign exposures will likely be countercyclical under Basel II (i. e., capital requirements will increase during recessions).

40|$|We derive {{the exact}} loss {{distribution}} for portfolios of bonds or cor-porate loans {{when the number}} of risks grows indefinitely. We show that in many cases this distribution lies in the maximal domain of attraction of the Weibull (Type III) limit law. Knowledge of the dis-tribution and its tail behavior is important for risk management in order not to over- or underestimate the likelihood of extreme <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> for the portfolio as a whole. Conform to the credit risk literature, we assume that bond (or loan) defaults are triggered by a latent variable model involving two stochastic variables: systematic and idiosyncratic risk of the bond. It is shown that the tail behavior of these two variables translates into the tail behavior of the whole <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution. Surprisingly, even if both variables are thin-tailed, the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution can have a finite tail index. Moreover, if idiosyncratic risk exhibits heavier tails than the systematic risk factor the tail index of the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution can become extremely high, giving rise to a non-conventional shape of the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution. <b>credit</b> risk; value-at-risk; tail events; tail index. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{limiting}} {{approach to}} portfolio credit risk, we obtain analytic expressions for the tail behavior of <b>credit</b> <b>losses.</b> To capture the co-movements in defaults over time, {{we assume that}} defaults are triggered by a general, possibly non-linear, factor model involving both systematic and idiosyncratic risk factors. The model encompasses default mechanisms in popular models of portfolio credit risk, such as CreditMetrics and CreditRisk+. We show how the tail characteristics of portfolio <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> depend directly upon the factor model’s functional form and the tail properties of the model’s risk factors. In many cases the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution has a polynomial (rather than exponential) tail. This feature is robust to changes in tail characteristics of the underlying risk factors. Finally, we show that the interaction between portfolio quality and <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> tail behavior is strikingly different between the CreditMetrics and CreditRisk+ approach to modeling portfolio credit risk...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} portfolio <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distributions {{based on}} a factor model for individual exposures and establish an analytic characterization of the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution {{if the number of}} exposures tends to infinity. Using this limiting distribution, we explain how skewness and leptokurtosis of <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distributions relate to the underlying factor model and the portfolio composition. A key role is played by the R 2 of the factor model regression. Based on the limiting distribution and empirical data, it appears that the Basle 8 % rule is not an unreasonable approximation for high confidence (99. 9 %) quantiles of <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> of a typical portfolio of rated corporate bonds. The practical relevance of our results for credit risk management is investigated by checking the applicability of the limiting distribution to portfolios with a finite number of exposures. It appears that for relatively homogeneous portfolios a minimum of 300 exposures is enough, while for relatively heterogeneous portfolios a number of 800 exposures suffices to obtain an adequate approximation. Thus, our approach can be acredit risk; factor model; fat-tailed distributions; skewness; asymptotic analysis...|$|R
