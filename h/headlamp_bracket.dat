At some {{time during the}} next year it {{lost much of its}} streamlining, the nosecone being removed in favor of a conventional PRR smokebox front including the keystone numberplate placed centrally on the small smokebox door. A <b>headlamp</b> <b>bracket</b> mounted above that door also hung the locomotive's bell. The side skirting was cut back to expose pipework and fittings for easier maintenance. The skyline casing atop the boiler remained in place.The Q1 remained in service until late 1946, after which it was placed in storage. It was dismantled around 1949.|$|E

The speedometer, ammeter and light switch on the original Venoms were fitted into a steel headlamp nacelle; the optional rev counter {{had to go on}} a bracket. Later models with Thruxton forks had conventional <b>headlamp</b> <b>brackets</b> and separate instruments.|$|R
