5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its <b>highest</b> <b>possible</b> oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the <b>highest</b> <b>possible</b> state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E

5|$|During battle, players cast spells {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the <b>highest</b> <b>possible.</b> As the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.|$|E

5|$|The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, {{also known}} as The Restaurant, Restaurant Marco Pierre White and later Oak Room Marco Pierre White, was a {{restaurant}} run by chef proprietor Marco Pierre White. The restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel, London, on 14 September 1993, having previously wished to find a larger premises than his restaurant Harveys to seek a third Michelin star. In moving, the kitchen staff was {{more than doubled in}} number, and White used Pierre Koffman's La Tante Claire as a template to pursue his third star. This was awarded in the 1995 Michelin guide. White then moved the restaurant to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, London, in 1997, taking on the listed Oak Room as the main dining room. He sought a further rating of five red knives and forks in the guide, to gain the <b>highest</b> <b>possible</b> rating for the restaurant. It gained this award in the following guide.|$|E
