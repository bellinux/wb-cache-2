The {{aim of this study}} is for the first to present anupscaling procedure, where an existing farm level energyconsumption model, in combination with the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change’s guidelines, is used to calculateagricultural energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissionson the national level. Secondly, this procedure is used to simulatescenarios for conversion to organic farming in Denmark. Three scenarios for conversion to organic farming with thepresent crop yield and an expected improved future crop yieldare compared to the 1996 -situation in Denmark, whereconventional farming dominates. In all scenarios, fossil energyuse and emissions of the three major agricultural greenhousegases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are reduced. The highest reduction in the net energy use (49 - 51 %) is found ina scenario (A) with 100 % fodder self-sufficiency and reducedlivestock production, while the lowest reduction (10 - 16 %) isfound in a scenario (C), with the same animal production as in 1996. The average energy use per <b>fodder</b> <b>unit</b> in the organic cropproduction (1. 4 - 1. 5 MJ/fodder unit) and livestock production(18 - 24 MJ/livestock unit), was lower than in the 1996 -situation(2. 5 MJ/fodder unit, and 30 MJ/livestock unit). However, totalproduction was also lower in the organic scenarios, whichfurthermore had different compositions, with lower potentials forfuture bio-energy production...|$|E
40|$|Artificial {{pastures}} {{are used}} to increase carrying capacity in the wet tropics by supplying higher quality forage (energy and protein) to the animals all year long. Sowing pastures is labour-intensive so to be profitable all other possible growth limiting factors, especially minerals, should be alleviated. We studied nutrients intake (energy, protein and minerals) in cattle grazing Urochloa sp. pastures in Western DRC. Three Urochloa ruziziensis and 3 U. decumbens pastures in Kolo-Fuma (Bas-Congo, DRC) were studied. Three Ndama steers and 3 cows grazing each pasture consecutively during the short rainy and dry seasons were followed by handplucking and samples were analysed for energy, crude protein and ash to calculate energy value (<b>fodder</b> <b>units,</b> FU) and digestible crude protein content (DCP) of the diets. NIRS was used on faeces to determine dry matter (DM) intake and ICP-AES to determine mineral content of the diets. Intake levels reached 66 ± 4. 3 g kg- 1 LW 0. 75, nutritive value of forage was 0. 701 ± 0. 036 FU and 4. 78 ± 1. 04 % DCP, allowing daily weight gains > 550 g for steers and > 350 g for cows. P, Ca, Mg, K, Mn & Fe were provided above requirements by the pasture. Na, Cu and Zn were deficient, especially during the short dry season for Cu and Zn. U. ruziziensis pastures tended to provide more minerals, especially during the rainy season. A mineral supplement providing Na, Cu and Zn is required to reach the daily weight gains allowed by energy and protein supplies. The supplement could reasonably be similar for U. decumbens and U. ruziziensis pastures, but the dry season formula should provide more Cu and Zn than the rainy season formulaPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{early part}} of summer 1996 was rainy and cool, and the crop outlook was not too good. Instead, in August it was very warm and dry, {{which seems to have}} been {{favourable}} for agriculture, because the yield rose to the normal level. The cereal yield was 3. 7 bill. kg, and the total yield measured as <b>fodder</b> <b>units</b> was 5, 663 mill. f. u., which exceeds the yield of 1995 by 3 %. The cultivated area grew by almost 10 % from the previous year, which explains the increase in the total yield. The set-aside area decreased and it was only 10 % of the total arable land area. The earlier trends continued in livestock production. Milk production fell by about 1. 5 %, and about 2, 000 milk producers quit their production every year. The total of the farm quotas exceeds the national quota granted to Finland by 5 - 6 %, and the farm quotas will be cut by this amount in the beginning of April, 1997. The trade on quotas will become administered again {{in order to be able}} keep the costs of the expanding dairy farms in control. Pigmeat production grew by 3 % in 1996, and the market situation was quite good. The market prices were on the increase almost throughout the year as the meat consumption was transferred from beef to pigmeat. In Finland beef production stayed at about the same level as earlier, and the BSE disease did not influence the Finnish beef markets. The consumption of poultry meat continues to grow, and in 1996 the production increased by 18 %. There has been some increase in the foreign trade of meat. Pigmeat, in particular, is being imported and exported to an increasing extent. No major changes occurred in the consumer prices and, consequently, consumption stayed at about the same level as earlier. Like in the past few years, cheese consumption grew to some extent, and poultry meat consumption also continued to grow very strongly. Instead, there was some decrease in the egg consumption. According to a preliminary estimate, agricultural income fell by about 7 %. This was mainly caused by the decrease in the amount of aid by about FIM 1. 0 bill. Agricultural income calculated at the market price rose by FIM 0. 5 bill., mainly as a result of the increase in the amount of cereals entering the markets. The crop was good and stocks were discharged. The second year did not bring along any significant changes in the agricultural production or prices. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the future among the producers. The number of farms decreases quite rapidly, and this has aroused speculations about the collapse of agriculture especially in the more remote areas. However, no alarming changes are foreseen in the production, and investments have also been made, which indicates that there is still faith in the Finnish agriculture. vMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|R

The crop of 1997 was in {{accordance}} with the long-term trend, despite the cold early part of the summer, which delayed the sowing. After June the weather was hot and the growth was more rapid than usually. The total amount of cereals harvested was 3. 8 bill. kg, and this exceeded that of 1996 by 2. 7 %. The total yield measured as <b>fodder</b> <b>units</b> was 3 % higher than in 1996. There was some increase in both the area and the average yields. The area under set-aside decreased by almost 10 %. Milk production started to grow in 1997. The quantities produced on farms that continued their production grew considerable, because the number of milk suppliers fell by 1, 900. The average yield/cow grew by almost 200 l. In terms of the structural development the high price of milk quotas has been considered problematic, and partly administered quota trade was introduced in 1997. Pigmeat production grew by 5 %. The market prices started to rise in June. There was some increase in beef production, too, but the price of beef decreased from the previous year. Poultry meat consumption continued to grow, and the production also grew by almost 10 %. The decrease in egg production was not large enough to solve the serious market problems due to oversupply. Both agricultural imports and exports grew in 1997. Dairy products, meat, and cereals were imported more than in the previous year. Cereal imports decreased clearly, but the imports of more highly processed foods grew. There were no major changes in the consumer prices or in the consumption. Cheese consumption started to decrease slightly, which is contrary to the trend in the past few years. The consumption of eggs and pigmeat fell, too. The agricultural income in 1997 was about FIM 6. 6 bill., which is about 1 % lower than in 1996. The production volume grew, but the agricultural aid declined. The prices of production inputs rose by about 2 %, and the producer prices fell a little over 1 %. More investments were made in agriculture than for a long time. Investments were encouraged by public aid. In 1997 loans and subsidies were granted for altogether 15, 000 projects, and the cost estimates of these totaled FIM 4. 2 bill. The aid amounted to over FIM 900 mill. Investment aid was mainly directed to increasing the farm size and environmental investments. The small size of Finnish farms affects their competitiveness on the single market, and environmental aid requires considerable investments in livestock production. The year 1997 did not bring along any major changes in agricultural production or prices of the products. The future of Finnish agriculture involves a great deal of uncertainty. National aid consists of many different measures, and the decision on the continuation of many of these must be decided on in the negotiations before the end of 1999. The proposals of the Commission for a reform of the common agricultural policy are difficult for Finland, where agriculture operates in extremely adverse natural conditions. vokMTT Taloustutkimu...|$|R

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of good quality irrigation {{water is a}} severe problem in dry areas of Pakistan, which has forced growers to widely explore {{the possibility of using}} salty water for irrigation. The shortage of irrigation water has increased since last decade, it is incumbent on agriculture to maximize the use of water of all qualities. Irrigating crops in presence of saline groundwater presents unique opportunities and challenges. Some studies reported that use of saline water for irrigation is feasible,especially when saline water is blended or alternated with good quality water. A series of experiments was conducted in laboratory, glass-house and field conditions at Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam and Universiti Putra Malaysia from 2004 to 2007. Ten maize cultivars (Hicorn, Agaiti- 2002, Margalla, Akbar, Sahiwal 2002, EV- 5098, EV- 3001, EV- 1098, EV- 6098 and EV- 4001) were screened for salt- tolerance under different water qualities (EC 0. 4, 2, 4, 6 and 8 dS m- 1). Four maize cultivars were selected (EV- 1098 and Agaiti- 2002 as salt-tolerant and EV- 4001 and Akbar as most salt-sensitive) and were further tested under saline irrigation scheduling and farmyard manure levels. The cultivar screening studies showed that out of ten maize cultivars, EV- 1098 and Agaiti- 2002 were salt-tolerant and EV- 4001 Akbar were most saltsensitive. It was observed that increase in salinity of water from EC 2. 0 to 8. 0 dS m- 1 significantly affected all agronomic traits as well as soil and plant chemical properties. Maximum plumule, radical length,plumule, radical fresh weight, plumule, radical dry weight, plant height, stem girth, green leaves plant- 1, green fodder and dry fodder yield were found under application of canal water (EC 0. 40 dS m- 1) and water quality having EC 2. 0 dS m- 1. Both treatments were at par with each other. It was further observed that application of saline water beyond EC 2. 0 dS m- 1 significantly reduced all the plant parameters and minimum values were exhibited under EC 8. 0 dS m- 1. Results indicated that soil salinity increased with increasing salinity levels of irrigation water. Same trend was observed in case of soluble cations (Na+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 +), anions (Cl- and SO 42 -), sodium adsorption ratio and exchangeable sodium percentage. However, soluble K+ decreased in soil profile with increase in water salinity. Over all results further indicated an increased contents of EC, soluble cations (Na+, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +), soluble anions (HCO 3 -, Cl-, and SO 42 -), SAR and ESP at surface soil layer compared to lower layers, however, pH was more in lower soil depths. Among the cultivars, EV- 1098 and Agaiti- 2002 had good performance containing lower concentrations of Na+ and Cl- and higher K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +,resulting in higher K+/ Na+ ratio. The cultivar EV- 4001 and Akbar accumulated maximum concentration of Na+ and Cl- and minimum concentration of K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and were identified as salt-sensitive. A pot study on saline irrigation scheduling showed that application of canal water (EC 0. 18 dS m- 1) at all growth stages of maize and treatments comprising canal water application during soaking and at early whorl stage and saline water (EC 4. 0 dS m- 1) during late whorl stage were at par with each other and produced taller plants, maximum stem girth and green leaves plant- 1, green and dry fodder yield. In contrast, these plant traits decreased in the treatments where sole application of saline water was applied at all growth stages. In this irrigation scheduling study,EV- 1098 and Agaiti- 2002 were salt-tolerant with better performance compared to EV- 4001 and Akbar as salt-sensitive. The values of EC, soluble Na+, Cl-,SO 42 -, SAR and ESP in soil increased where crop received saline water throughout growing period. The soluble K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + contents in soil increased where canal water was applied from sowing to harvest. FYM reduced the negative impact of saline water on crop parameters including fodder yield. Maximum response was obtained at FYM 25 tons ha- 1, beyond this non-significant increase in the agronomic values was noted. Sole application of saline water reduced the growth and fodder yield of maize cultivars and increased salt contents in soil and caused accumulation of toxic ions (Na+ and Cl-) in plant. The salt-tolerant cultivars (EV- 1098 and Agaiti- 2002) responded better under saline condition compared to salt-sensitive (EV- 4001 and Akbar) cultivars by maintaining more concentration of K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + in plants. Regression analyses across maize cultivars, water qualities,irrigation scheduling and FYM showed positive relationships of plant height, green leaves, and K+ concentration in plant and negative relationship of dry leaves, Na+ and Claccumulation in plant with maize <b>fodder</b> yield. The <b>unit</b> increase in various traits resulted in corresponding increase in maize green fodder yield. It was concluded that EV- 1098 and Agaiti- 2002 were most salt-tolerant cultivars and EV- 4001 and Akbar were more salt-sensitive against saline irrigation water. Canal water application to maize and canal water application during soaking + early whorl stage + brackish water (EC 4. 0 dS m- 1) during late whorl stage were equally efficient where lower accumulation of toxic ions in plants were noted. The saline water could also be applied to maize at later growth stages when canal water is scarce. The adverse effects of the saline water could also be minimized by the application of canal water or incorporation of FYM at the rate of 25 - 30 tons ha- 1 in the soil...|$|R
