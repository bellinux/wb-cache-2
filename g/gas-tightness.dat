Silver-based braze compositions like Ag- 4 CuO {{are used for}} reactive air brazing of <b>gas-tightness</b> samples. During aging in air at 850 °C for 800 h all tested samples remained hermetic. However, microstructural analysis reveals the formation of voids within the brazing zones and severe changes of the interfacial oxide layers. It is shown, that due to the diffusion of chromium and manganese from the steel substrate {{the thickness of the}} reaction layers increases and the phase composition changes. Furthermore, in previous work a decrease of the bending strength of reactive air brazed YSZ-steel joints due to the microstructural changes is observed. In contrast, the aging in dual atmospheres at 850 °C causes strong degradation and the total loss of <b>gas-tightness.</b> Reducing atmospheric conditions lead to different reactions profiles of the silver based brazes in contact with the YSZ electrolyte.

40|$|The {{operating}} temperature of solid oxide fuel cells can be lowered {{by the use}} of very thin electrolyte membranes. In this work two methods were tested to deposit thin yttria-stabilised zirconia membranes onto the anode substrates of the fuel cells: the reactive DC sputtering process and the electrochemical vapour deposition (EVD). An influence of the anodes' microstructure {{on the quality of the}} electrolyte membrane was expected. Therefore the microstructure of the substrates was modified by sintering at temperatures between 1300 and 1400 C. Subsequently the porosity, pore size and electrical conductivity of the anodes were tested. Thin electrolyte membranes were deposited and the influence of the modified microstructure of the anode on microstructure, <b>gas-tightness</b> and ionic conductivity of the membranes were investigated. A following annealing step was supposed to increase the <b>gas-tightness</b> of the electrolyte membranes further. After optimising the processing parameters, several electrolyte membranes were coated with cathode films and these fuel cells were electrochemically tested. It was shown that the EVD process is not suitable for the deposition of YSZ onto the anode substrates, because of removal of the nickel oxide out of the anode due to the chloride precursors leading to the formation of volatile nickel chloride. Electrolyte membranes with a thickness of about 7 #mu#m were deposited onto the anode substrates by the sputtering process. The following annealing step increased the <b>gas-tightness</b> of the membranes as long as the annealing temperature was chosen to be not much higher than the sintering temperature of the anode itself.

40|$|A 3 D Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{model of the}} fumigation process in the Hal Ross Flour Mill of Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA, was formulated for prediction of the gas leakage rate to approximate the gas Half-loss time (HLT) during fumigation with Methyl bromide (MB) and Sulfuryl fluoride (SF). The model consisted of external and internal flow domains. The external domain was used to predict stagnation pressures generated by wind impinging on the mill’s walls. The internal domain was used to predict fumigant leakage rates in terms of HLT. Cracks on the mill’s walls represented the effective leakage areas on the internal flow domain. This modeling approach had {{been used by the}} authors (Chayaprasert and Maier) in a previous study, but it was simplified and improved in the present study. The primary simplification in the modeling approach was exclusion of the flour mill’s interior details (e. g., milling equipment), reducing the model formulation and simulation computing times. In the previous study, the <b>gas-tightness</b> of the internal flow domain was identified by varying the flow resistance coefficient of the effective leakage areas until the model yielded a HLT value that was close to the one observed from the experimental fumigant concentration data.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of layers}} of fully yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering was studied {{with regard to}} their application as thin electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). A thin layer of YSZ was deposited on top of anode substrates for SOFC. The substrate comprises the warm-pressed anode itself, which supports the complete cell, and an anode functional layer deposited by vacuum slip casting, which is in direct contact with the electrolyte. From previous experiments it is known that non-assisted reactive DC magnetron sputtering produces layers with rather high leak-rate even when depositing at high temperatures. Residual pores on the substrates' surfaces are responsible for the incomplete coverage by the thin electrolyte and are detrimental to the cell's performance. In the present paper, the effect of increasing bias power applied to the substrate is studied.

The electrolyte layers are applied by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) gas flow sputtering (GFS) process. The <b>gas-tightness</b> of the electrolyte is significantly improved when sequential oxidic and metallic thin-film multi-layers are deposited, which interrupt the columnar grain structure of single-layer electrolytes.

For this, the Outer Tracker (OT) was constructed, consisting of similar to 55, 000 straw tubes, covering in total an area of 360 m(2) of double layers. The detector is foreseen to operate under large particle rates, up to 100 kHz/cm per straw in the region closest to the beam. The front-end electronics is expected to provide the precise (0. 5 ns) drift-time measurement, at an average occupancy of 5 % and at 1 MHz trigger rate. The tracking procedure requires high-efficiency (low thresholds), {{while at the same}} time putting stringent limits on the noise level. The modular detector structure reflects on the FE electronics: 128 channels are read out by one FE Box. During installation, the dark current, the response to radioactive sources, and the <b>gas-tightness</b> of all detector units was checked and only a handful of bad channels were found. Special hardware and dedicated procedures, integrated within the experimental control system, have been designed for the detector calibration during data taking. At the time of the conference, the detector has been installed and commissioned with the help of cosmic rays events producing tracks through OT. During the first days of the LHC commissioning, the detector was operated on nominal voltage and large-multiplicity events originating at the circulating beam were recorded and studied.

40|$|Recent direct {{implementation}} of asperity theories is reinterpreted here to formulate an improved {{version of the}} Greenwood and Williamson (GW) theory with the inclusion of interaction between asperities. This is achieved by treating the contact pressures as uniformly distributed over the apparent contact area and the resulting deformation as uniform. The correction is equivalent to an increase of the effective separation of the mean planes by a quantity proportional to the nominal pressure, resulting in a reduction of the "real" area of contact and of total load for a given separation. However, the area-load relationship is unchanged. The correction effectively depends on the ratio between the nominal pressure and the elastic modulus multiplied by the ratio between {{the size of the}} nominal contact area and standard deviation of the asperity heights. For contacts much larger than the size of roughness, uniform interaction effectswould be dominant at relatively modest pressures (particularly for soft materials). This also means that the effect of interaction is unlimited. However, the only significant change is in the prediction of <b>gas-tightness,</b> it is harder to seal a large area than a small one. The modification of the theory has a significant effect on stiffness and conductance. Indeed, a parallel is drawn between this correction and the "clustering" terms of resistance in the Holm-Greenwood formulae for a cluster of circular spots. Finally, numerical contact simulations using Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (WM) surfaces show a general agreement with the improved theory but also significant scatter for low load levels. Taking into account the effect of asperity interaction, the improved GWtheory is now able to predict the numerically obtained contact response for intermediate load level...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of a thin film electrolyte layer with a thickness in the micrometer range could greatly improve current solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in terms of operating temperature and power output. Since the achievable minimal layer thickness with conventional powder coating methods is limited to similar to 5 mu m, a variety of thin film methods have been studied, but results on regular large-scale anode substrates are still lacking in the literature. In this paper, a wet coating process is presented for fabricating gas-tight 1 - 2 mu m thick 8 YSZ electrolyte layers on a regular NiO/ 8 YSZ substrate, with a rough surface, a high porosity and a large pore size. These layers were deposited {{in a similar way}} as conventional suspension based layers, but the essential difference includes the use of coating liquids (nano-dispersion, sol) with a considerably smaller particle size (85 nm, 60 nm, 35 nm, 6 nm). Successful deposition of such layers was accomplished by means of an innovative coating process, which involves the preparation of a hybrid polyvinyl alcohol/ 8 YSZ membrane by dip-coating or spin-coating and subsequently burning out the polymer part at 500 degrees C. Results from He leak tests confirmed that the sintered layers posses a very low number of defects and with values in the range 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 6) (hPa dm(3)) /(s cm(2)) the <b>gas-tightness</b> of the thin film layers is satisfactory for fuel cell operation. Moreover, preliminary results have also indicated a potential reduction of the sintering temperature from 1400 degrees C to the range 1200 - 1300 degrees C, using the presented coating process.

40|$|Ceramic {{membrane}} {{with unique}} morphology {{can be prepared}} using phase inversion and sintering technique. Dual layer lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) /alumina hollow fibre membrane {{in this study was}} prepared using this technique. The contributing parameters in the preparation of asymmetric alumina hollow fibre during fabrication process were investigated. The parameters involved in the process were the alumina/polyethersulfone (PESf) ratio, the internal coagulant temperature and the air-gap distance. Next, the suitable LSCF coating formulations were studied to obtain thin layer of LSCF. This was followed by the impregnations of catalyst prepared using sol-gel Pechini method. The characterizations were carried out for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray spectrometry (EDX), apparent porosity, gas permeability test, <b>gas-tightness</b> test, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller technique, dilatometer analysis and mechanical test. The results showed that a reduction of alumina/PESf ratio from 10 to 6 resulted in the formation of asymmetric structure. The 53 weight % of alumina (AL- 53) was selected as membrane support with 1. 68 mm, 1. 08 mm and 168 µm of outside, inside diameter and finger-like length, respectively. The AL- 53 had acceptable mechanical strength of 24 MPa and high gas permeability of 13. 87 x 10 - 4 mol m- 2 Pa- 1 s- 1. The 25 weight % of LSCF membrane sintered at 1150 oC had the lowest nitrogen gas permeability of 2. 401 x 10 - 6 mol m- 2 Pa- 1 s- 1 that was considered as gas-tight LSCF layer. The dual layer LSCF/alumina hollow fibre membrane was impregnated with 10 weight % of cerium oxide doped copper oxide catalyst. This catalyst was characterized using the SEM/EDX to ensure the catalyst was placed inside the finger-like structure of alumina membrane support. The dual layer of LSCF/alumina hollow fibre membrane was successfully produced using phase inversion and sintering technique which will be beneficial for multifunctional application...|$|E
40|$|Solid oxide {{electrolysis}} cells (SOECs) {{belong to}} the most efficient and cost-effective electrochemical devices for the energy storage application via power to gas (P 2 G) concept. Intermittent energy in form of electricity or heat from renewable sources can be stored long-termly in the magnitude of GWh level as chemical energy in H 2 and CO through the electrolysis process occurs in SOEC systems. In comparison to conventional anode-supported and electrolyte-supported full ceramic cells, metal supported cells has many advantages, such as reduced manufacturing and maintenance cost, fast start-up features, excellent mechanical, thermal and redox cycle stability, and etc. In this work, novel metal-supported cells were fabricated on robust porous ferritic steel. Nickel free composite made of La 0. 1 Sr 0. 9 TiO 3 -α (LST) and gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) was applied as fuel electrode material. 3 m thick thin-film bilayer electrolyte of GDC/yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was prepared {{by a combination of}} physical vapour deposition (PVD) and wet ceramic processing. The fuel electrode and La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) air electrode were both deposited by screen printing. The <b>gas-tightness</b> of the electrolyte was monitored by differential air leakage tests at room temperature. Half cells with low leakage rate were selected and loaded with nickel nanoparticles as catalysts into the LST-GDC backbones to improve the electrochemical performance of the fuel electrode. Cells were tested under fuel cell mode and electrolysis mode, respectively. Performance and aging characteristics during operation were analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronopotentiometry. Subsequently, the post mortem analysis was applied to facilitate the understanding of the degradation features and mechanisms specific to the electrolysis operation of the metal-supported cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{optimization}} of La 2 O 3 -containing diopside based glass-ceramics (GCs) for sealant applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Seven glass compositions were prepared by modifying the parent glass composition, Ca 0. 8 Ba 0. 1 MgAl 0. 1 La 0. 1 Si 1. 9 O 6. First five glasses were prepared {{by the addition of}} different amounts of B 2 O 3 in a systematic manner (i. e. 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 wt. %) to the parent glass composition while the remaining two glasses were derived by substituting SrO for BaO in the glasses containing 2 wt. % and 5 wt. % B 2 O 3. Structural and thermal behavior of the glasses was investigated by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), density measurements, dilatometry and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Liquid-liquid amorphous phase separation was observed in B 2 O 3 -containing glasses. Sintering and crystallization behavior, microstructure, and properties of the GCs were investigated under different heat treatment conditions (800 and 850 degrees C: 1 - 300 h). The GCs with > 5 wt. % B 2 O 3 showed an abnormal thermal expansion behavior above 600 degrees C. The chemical interaction behavior of the glasses with SOFC electrolyte and metallic interconnects, has been investigated in air atmosphere at SOFC operating temperature. Thermal shock resistance and <b>gas-tightness</b> of GC sealants in contact with 8 YSZ was evaluated in air and water. The total electrical resistance of a model cell comprising Crofer 22 APU and 8 YSZ plates joined by a CC sealant has been examined by the impedance spectroscopy. Good matching of thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) and strong, but not reactive, adhesion to electrolyte and interconnect, in conjunction with a low level of electrical conductivity, indicate that the investigated GCs are suitable candidates for further experimentation as SOFC sealants.

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{potential}} of sol–gel process to prepare cathode and electrolyte thin and thick layers on anodic NiO-YSZ supports which were also made from powders prepared by sol–gel route. YSZ and La 2 − xNiO 4 + δ, La 4 Ni 3 O 10 were synthesized as electrolyte and cathode materials for SOFC applications. For electrolyte shaping, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ, 8 % Y 2 O 3) thick films were cast onto porous NiO-YSZ composite substrates by a dip-coating process using a new suspension formulation. Part of the YSZ precursor colloidal sol was added in the suspension to ensure both homogeneity and adhesion of the electrolyte on the anodic substrate after thermal treatment at 1400 °C for 2 h. By precisely controlling the synthesis parameters, dense and gas-tight layers with thicknesses {{in the range of}} 10 – 20 μm have been obtained. <b>Gas-tightness</b> was confirmed by He permeation measurements. Concerning cathode processing, a duplex microstructured cathode consisting of both La 2 − xNiO 4 + δ ultra-thin films (few nanometers) and La 2 − xNiO 4 + δ and/or La 4 Ni 3 O 10 thick layers (few micrometers) was prepared on YSZ substrates by the dip-coating process, with the thickness being dependent {{on the nature of the}} dip-coated solution (polymeric sol or adequate suspension).
