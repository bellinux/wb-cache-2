40|$|Introduction There {{are several}} ways to give a {{semantics}} of a programming language. Each kind of semantics gives a different insight into the meaning of a language, and <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>different</b> tasks. The axiomatic approach specifies a language by means of the properties it possesses. Such a specification need not necessarily be complete. Examples of such systems are Hoare Logic [Apt 81] and Dijkstra's predicate transformers [DS 90].. Such a semantics is useful when one is still working out the details of the language, and also for highlighting important features to users. The denotational approach is to define a function from programs to their meanings. These meanings, or denotations, are mathematical values which represent the result of running the program. Such a semantics is useful for users and designers of languages. Schmidt [Sch 88] contains an excellent introduction to denotational semantics. The operational approach is to define a kind of mathematical mac...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the {{construction}} of a numerical solution of the Black–Scholes equation modeling option pricing with a discrete dividend payment. This model is a partial differential equation with two variables: the underlying asset and the time to maturity, and involves the shifted Dirac delta function centered at the dividend payment date. This generalized function is suitable for approximation by means of sequences of ordinary functions. By applying a semidiscretization technique on the asset, a numerical solution is obtained and the independence of the considered sequence in a wide class of delta defining sequences is proved. From the study of the influence of the spatial step h, it follows that the difference between the numerical solution for h and h/ 2 is O(h 2) as h⟶ 0. The proposed method <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>different</b> discrete dividend types like a dividend of present value D 0, a constant yield dividend or an arbitrary underlying asset-dependent yield dividend payment.

In this paper, Dynamic time warping (DTW) technique is utilized to recognize speaker independent Emotion recognition based on 39 MFCC features. A large audio of around 960 samples of isolated words of five different emotions are collected and recorded at 20 to 300 KHz sampling frequency. Training and test templates are generated using 39 MFCC features. In the proposed work, we have extracted the MFCC coefficients from the speech database and DTW is used to store a prototypical version of each word in the vocabulary and compute incoming emotion with each word. For the classification of emotions SVM is used. The experimental results are provided using MFCC, Delta Coefficients (# 8710;MFCC) and Delta Delta Coefficients(# 8710;# 8710;MFCC).

As the paper markets in Western Europe and North America have stabilized, the competition has tightened. Along with the development of more cost-effective processes and products, new process design methods are also required to break the old molds and create new ideas. This thesis discusses the development of a process design methodology based on simulation and optimization methods. A bi-level optimization problem and a solution procedure for it are formulated and illustrated. Computational models and simulation are used to illustrate the phenomena inside a real process and mathematical optimization is exploited to find out the best process structures and control principles for the process. Dynamic process models are used inside the bi-level optimization problem, which is assumed to be dynamic and multiobjective {{due to the nature of}} papermaking processes.
