5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
5|$|In January 1940, the U-boats opened another offensive. Some 21 Submarines sank 42 ships. All were east of 11°W, {{and thus}} {{within range of}} the Command’s aircraft. The {{situation}} worsened, {{although it was not}} disastrous until after the collapse of France. The need for long-range aircraft was identified by the first success of Coastal Command. A No. 228 Squadron Sunderland sighted a U-boat, , enable to submerge after sinking three ships. It directed Destroyers to engage it. U-55 was scuttled. Had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the Sunderland, the submarine would have escaped.|$|E

The Belgian Army {{was holding the}} German Fourteenth Army on the KW-line, along with the French 7th and British armies.

5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He {{was one of the first}} to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff City {{began their}} {{campaign}} for the 1926–27 FA Cup with a home game at Ninian Park in front of around 30,000 fans against Aston Villa. After a goalless first half, Cardiff scored twice via a header by Len Davies and a shot by Ernie Curtis. Aston Villa attempted to save the match, but were unable to score until goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff played Darlington away. Newspaper reports {{indicated that they were}} the better team, but had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the success of Darlington's defence then they would have won by greater than the two goal margin they achieved. Goals came from George McLachlan and Hughie Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Chandler, who {{was also}} {{allegedly}} at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview. In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey's story, although he placed the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in January 1947. He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came {{to his home in}} Kentucky to discuss the matter further. According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson's transfer unless he had Chandler's full support, which Chandler subsequently pledged. Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, {{there is no evidence that}} his meeting with Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Chandler's intervention.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh {{came from}} very {{different}} backgrounds. Cope {{was born into}} a wealthy and influential Quaker family based in Philadelphia. Although his father wanted his son to work as a farmer, Cope distinguished himself as a naturalist. In 1864, already a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Cope became a professor of zoology at Haverford College and joined Ferdinand Hayden on his expeditions west. In contrast, Marsh would have grown up poor, the son of a struggling family in Lockport, New York, had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the benefaction of his uncle, philanthropist George Peabody. Marsh persuaded his uncle to build the Peabody Museum of Natural History, placing Marsh as head of the museum. Combined with the inheritance he received from Peabody upon his death in 1869, Marsh was financially comfortable (although, partly because of Peabody's stern views on marriage, Marsh would remain a lifelong bachelor).|$|E

5|$|Dreaming of You {{was among}} the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, best-selling debut by a female act, and the fastest-selling U.S. album of 1995. It has since been ranked among {{the best and most}} {{important}} recordings produced during the rock and roll era. Media outlets have since ranked the recording among the best posthumous releases. When Dreaming of You peaked at number one, Tejano music entered the mainstream market. Music critics said the general population of the U.S. would not have known about Tejano or Latin music had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Dreaming of You. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 35×platinum (Latin field), for shipping 3.5 million units in the U.S. The album was eventually certified gold by Music Canada and by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON). As of January 2015, the album has sold five million copies worldwide, and remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In 1263, the {{situation}} in Bulgaria was far from stable, as Constantine was facing both the threat of his predecessor Mitso Asen's throne ambitions and a large-scale Byzantine invasion. Because Constantine was unable to assist Jacob against the advancing Byzantines, Jacob sought aid from his northern neighbour, Hungarian king Stephen V. The Hungarians drove the Byzantines out of Jacob's domain and themselves invaded Byzantine-controlled territories. Rescued from the Byzantine threat, Jacob Svetoslav submitted to Hungarian suzerainty. Stephen V placed him as the ruler of the Vidin province on the Danube River, previously governed for Hungary by the then-deceased Rostislav Mikhailovich, and allowed him to retain his lands to the south. Had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the appointment of Jacob Svetoslav as a Hungarian vassal at Vidin, Bulgaria would have re-established control over the city in 1263.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{three years}} after the {{resumption}} of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Liddell {{became one}} of many players to be offered a {{transfer}} to Colombia by agents representing Independiente Santa Fe and Club Deportivo Los Millonarios. The clubs belonged to the DIMAYOR, unrecognised by FIFA because of a dispute between the league and the domestic governing body. Restrictions in England limited the weekly wage (£12 in the season and £10 during the summer) and impeded a player's ability to transfer to another club, which caused much discontent in British football until the system was reformed in the 1960s. Liddell chose to reject the contract offer, reportedly estimated at £12,000. His wife Phyllis, whom he married in 1946, later attributed the decision to club loyalty and the recent birth of twins. He later recalled that the proposal had been tempting, acknowledging that the decision {{would have been more}} challenging had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the births. Many footballers did agree to contracts, including Alfredo Di Stefano, Neil Franklin, Charlie Mitten, and Hector Rial.|$|E
5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Galland pursued {{innovations}} {{with existing}} designs. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 aircraft was formed into several Geschwader with distinctly upgraded firepower. Called the Sturmbock (Battering ram), these machines could inflict heavy damage on unescorted bomber formations. Galland supported {{the conversion of}} units such as Jagdgeschwader 300 to the Sturmbock role. The Sturmbock were heavily armed and armoured, which meant they were un-manoeuvrable and vulnerable without protection from escorting Bf 109s. Still, the tactics quickly became widespread and {{were one of the}} few Luftwaffe success stories in 1944. Galland said after the war, that had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the Allied landing in Normandy which increased the need for lighter fighter variants, each Geschwader in the Luftwaffe would have contained a Gruppe of Sturmbock aircraft by September 1944.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{incorporation}} {{of rock and}} roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as Restless Heart, Shenandoah, Exile, Diamond Rio, Lonestar, Ricochet, and the Mavericks. According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of Country Music: The Encyclopedia, the group's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers. Prior to Alabama's unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets. Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.|$|E
