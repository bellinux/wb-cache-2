40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} myth, dreams, and historical trauma within the genre of the Asian North American female bildungsroman. In an attempt to redefine the contested genre of the ethnic bildungsroman, this study analyzes three novels by Asian American and Asian Canadian female authors: Cecilia Manguerra Brainard 2 ̆ 7 s When the Rainbow Goddess Wept (1991), Joy Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan (1981), and Lan Cao 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Monkey</b> Bridge (1997). Each of these novels is an ethnic bildungsroman that highlights the identity formation of a female protagonist {{in the midst of}} historical trauma. This study focuses on the ways in which these texts resist the conventions of the European bildungsroman through the factors of myth, dreams, and historical trauma. While Philippine folklore is the vehicle through which protagonist Yvonne matures in Brainard 2 ̆ 7 s When the Rainbow Goddess Wept, dreams and childhood tales in Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan enable protagonist Naomi to develop and reconnect with her lost mother. Similarly, in Cao 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Monkey</b> Bridge, protagonist Mai uses the Vietnamese legend of the Trung sisters to develop a transnational identity and reconnect with her mother and motherland. In all three of these novels, myths and dreams function as alternative spaces of development that interrupt the immediate trauma of the texts. Myth, dreams, and trauma are thus integral to the project of redefining the Asian North American female bildungsroman...|$|R

In my dissertation I address the changing reproductive strategies in callitrichine New World monkeys and their genetic underpinnings using a phylogenetic approach. The necessity for a resolved phylogeny is universal to any comparative genomic study. Here we have constructed a reliable phylogenetic framework from which reproductive strategy could be studied in callitrichines. First, to determine the most recent common ancestor of Anthropoid primates we took a phylogenomic approach, using the publicly available whole genome sequences of 17 mammal species. With high confidence, we determined here that Tarsier is the most recent common ancestor to Anthropoid primates. Secondly, we construct a reliable phylogenetic framework for New World monkeys. To do this, genomic sequence databases are developed and parsed for non-genic markers. The resulting phylogeny is based on 40 +kb of non-genic genomic data and contains 40 species. Finally the reproductive strategy of callitrichines was investigated. The timing and mechanism of litter size reduction in Goeldi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>monkey</b> was accessed though detection of chimerism and adaptive evolution of genes involved in reproduction.

40|$|Amygdala {{kindling}} is {{a widely}} used animal model to study network changes during mesial temporal lobe epileptogenesis. The aim {{of the current study}} was to study the effective connectivity in fully kindled macaques using electrical microstimulation during fMRI. Two rhesus monkeys were implanted with low impedance electrodes in the right amygdala. Electrical kindling consisted of daily stimulation with a 1 second, 60 Hz sine wave at the intensity of the afterdischarge threshold (500 μA <b>monkey</b> <b>S,</b> 1100 μA <b>monkey</b> K). Monkeys were considered fully kindled when they showed stable stage 4 seizures (bilateral tonicclonic movements), which was after 515 days of electrical kindling in <b>monkey</b> <b>S</b> and 477 days in monkey K. When fully kindled, the monkeys were injected with a contrast agent and scanned at a 3 T Siemens MR scanner with an 8 -channel phased-array coil under ketamine/medetomidine sedation. The fMRI protocol consisted of interleaved stimulation and no-stimulation blocks. During stimulation blocks, the amygdala was stimulated with a squared bipolar pulse (pulse width 0. 48 ms, frequency 200 Hz, duration 250 ms, intensity 800 - 1000 μA) every 2500 ms. No seizures were evoked during fMRI microstimulation. Electrical microstimulation of the kindling site in the amygdala during fMRI revealed extensive fMRI activations in cortical and subcortical structures in both <b>monkeys.</b> In <b>monkey</b> <b>S,</b> we observed strong significant activations in the ipsilateral putamen, thalamus, somatosensory cortex, early visual areas and in the contralateral cerebellum. In monkey K, the main activations were observed in the contralateral amygdala, claustrum, thalamus, superior temporal sulcus and the cerebellum. A conjunction analysis of the two monkeys (at a threshold of p< 0. 01 uncorrected for each monkey) revealed common fMRI activations in the contralateral amygdala, pallidum, thalamus and cerebellum. Therefore, the amygdala in stage 4 kindled monkeys is connected to extensive, bilateral networks of cortical and subcortical structures.

The vaccine composed of S. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a {{decrease in the number of}} S. mutans, an increase in IgG antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to LTA. When LTA was used as immunogen, there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to LTA and a slight increase in IgG antibodies to cells of S. mutans. Vaccines of L. acidophilus or L. ferrnentum gave no protection. A combined vaccine of S. mutans and L. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre to cells of S. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the <b>S.</b> mutans-immunised <b>monkeys.</b> The results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with S. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli.

Because {{of this activity}} and the finding of immune responses to S antigen in patients with uveitis, this protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis in humans. Peptide M, an 18 -amino acid component of S antigen, has previously {{been shown to be}} highly uveitopathogenic in rats and guinea pigs. We report here that peptide M is immunopathogenic in some monkeys, producing inflammatory changes in eyes and pineal glands similar to those induced by native <b>S</b> antigen. <b>Monkeys</b> with disease also developed intense immune responses to peptide M, measured by the lymphocyte proliferation assay. In addition, lymphocytes from these monkeys reacted against whole S antigen. Furthermore, lymphocytes from certain monkeys immunized with whole S antigen responded well against peptide M, thus indicating that this peptide is an immunodominant epitope in these animals. Two of the four monkeys immunized with peptide M did not develop disease. Lymphocytes from these two animals did not respond in culture against the peptide. Following immunization with the whole protein, these monkeys were capable, however, of developing cellular immunity against S antigen and one of them developed disease. The possible involvement of peptide M in the pathogenesis of uveitis in humans is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Observations on Plasmodium simium {{infections in}} Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis monkeys {{suggest that this}} host-parasite {{combination}} would be a suitable model for the testing of candidate vaccines against Plasmodium vivax. To evaluate {{the normal course of}} infections, parasitemia in 52 splenectomized <b>S.</b> boliviensis boliviensis <b>monkeys</b> infected with P. simium were analyzed. The mean maximum parasite count for 31 monkeys after injection with trophozoite-infected erythrocytes was 77, 580 /L. Twenty-one monkeys were infected via sporozoites, and prepatent periods ranged from 14 to 24 days with a median of 15 days. The mean maximum parasite count was 29, 234 /L. The mean maximum parasite count for monkeys previously infected with Old World P. vivax was 26, 337 /L versus 56, 362 /L for those previously infected with New World P. vivax, possibly suggesting a closer antigenic relationship between P. simium and the Old World parasites...|$|R
