Darba teorētiskā daļa apskata pašreizējā pētījuma metodi un iepriekšējo pētnieku darbus par šo tēmu. Izmantotā kvalitatīvā pētījuma metode ir Normana Fērklova (1992) trīsdimensionālais kritiskās diskursa analīzes modelis. Tika izpētīti 20 The Guardian un Daily Mail tiešsaistes avīžu raksti par biznesu un tika atlasīti un analizēti vairāki dzimuma stereotipu atspoguļojumi. Vēlāk no pētījuma rezultātiem varēja izvirzīt secinājumus. Var secināt, ka stereotipu izmantošana nav plaši izplatīta izvēlētajās tiešsaistes avīzēs un to atspoguļojums lielākoties balstās uz lietvārda frāzēm un metaforām, kā arī dažas darbības vārdu <b>frāzes</b> un īpašības vārdu <b>frāzes</b> ir izmantotas stereotipu veidošanā. Dzimuma un profesionālās identitātes bija atspoguļotas pamatojoties uz sabiedrībā iesakņotām dzimumu lomām. The present {{research}} seeks {{to find and}} analyse gender stereotypes in British online newspapers’ The Guardian and Daily Mail articles about business {{in order to find}} out what linguistic features construct a gender stereotype and how are the gender and professional identities represented in media discourse. The theoretical part of the paper examines the method of the {{present research}} and other researcher’s works on this topic. The qualitative research method of the present research is Norman Fairclough’s (1992) three-dimensional model of critical discourse analysis. 20 articles about business were studied and a number of gender stereotypical imagery were singled out and analysed. Afterwards, conclusions could be drawn according to the findings. It can be concluded that gender stereotyping is not widespread in the chosen online newspapers and the gender stereotypical imagery is based mostly on noun phrases and metaphors, also, several verb and adjective phrases were found used in the construction of stereotypes.

40|$|This study, {{which deals}} with code-switching and {{language}} choice in multilingual contexts, describes the use of Pidgin in creative works in English in Cameroon, with {{the focus on the}} forms that this language takes in the works, the types of characters who are made to speak this language, and the functions that this language plays in these works. The data comprise three plays and two novels, all published between 2000 and 2006 by experienced writers who have a good command of English and yet make their characters speak in Pidgin. The analysis shows that Pidgin in the corpus takes the form of individual lexemes like salaka (libation, sacrifice) and relatively short utterances like This sun fit kill man (This sun is so hot that it can kill someone.). The characters who speak Pidgin in these literary works are generally low-ranking and rural people, illiterates and other people who are hardly looked up to in the Cameroonian society. Finally, Pidgin helps writers to realise some stylistic effects such as variations on the scale of formality, with English being used when addressing a superior person and Pidgin when addressing an inferior person. Most importantly, creative writers reproduce in their works what is observed in the Cameroonian society and this can be regarded as a formal way of enhancing their readers’ plurilingual competence. Šiame darbe, kuriame tiriama kodų kaita ir kalbos pasirinkimas daugiakalbiuose kontekstuose, aprašoma maišyta vietinė ir anglų kalba – pidžinas –angliškuose kūriniuose Kamerūne, ypatingą dėmesį skiriant šios kalbos formoms, randamoms kūriniuose, ir veikėjų tipams, kurie kalba tokia kalba, bei jos funkcijoms kūriniuose. Tyrimo objektas – dvi pjesės ir trys romanai, išleisti patyrusių, puikiai anglų kalbą mokančių rašytojų, tačiau savo veikėjus verčiančių kalbėti pidžinu. Tyrimas rodo, kad pidžino atvejus šioje duomenų bazeje sudaro pavienės leksemos, pavyzdžiui, salaka (aukojami gėrimai, auka), arba sąlyginai trumpos <b>frazės,</b> kaip This sun fit kill man (Saulė tokia kaitri, kad gali ką nors pražudyti.). Veikėjai, kalbantys maišyta kalba, paprastai vaizduojami kaip žemos klasės kaimo žmonės, neraštingi asmenys ir tokie, į kuriuos kamerūniečiai paprastai nesilygiuoja. Be to, pidžinas rašytojams padeda atskleisti kai kuriuos stiliaus bruožus, pavyzdžiui, formalumo lygio pokyčius, kai anglų kalba vartojama kreipiantis į viršesnį asmenį, o pidžinu – kalbant su menkesniais už save. Svarbiausia, kad savo darbuose rašytojai atspindi Kamerūno visuomenę, taip galbūt formaliai stiprindami savo skaitytojų daugiakalbystės kompetenciją...|$|R

He started his career in Ohio as a machine tool operator in the 1940s. Using a loan from his wife, Martha, he established the Dayton Reliable Tool & Manufacturing Company, his own machine tool business in 1949.

5000|$|The {{similarly}} designed [...] "Easy-open ecology end" [...] {{was invented}} by Ermal <b>Fraze</b> and Omar Brown. Its patent application was also filed in 1975. This design, like Cudzik's, uses a separate tab attached to the upper surface as a lever to depress a scored part of the lid, which folds underneath {{the top of the}} can and {{out of the way of}} the resulting opening, thus reducing injuries and roadside litter caused by removable tabs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, whilst at {{a picnic}} with friends and family, <b>Fraze</b> decided to create an {{improved}} beverage can-opener instead of the separate [...] "church key" [...] opener - {{he had left his}} at home, so he had to use a car bumper to open the drinks. The old way of opening a can required a separate opener; <b>Fraze</b> wanted to find a solution that would eliminate the need for a one. This event {{led to the creation of}} the pull-tab opener. The first type that he created is not the in modern usage; it was dangerous for the user often causing injury. It used a lever that pierced a hole in the top of the can which produced sharp edges. Later that year, he established a mechanism known as the [...] "pull-tab" [...] can. Users are simply required to pull a removable tab to open the drink. He received U.S. patent No. 3,349,949 for invention in 1963, and subsequently sold his invention to Alcoa. By 1965, around 75% of U.S. breweries were using them. However, in the mid-1970s, pressure from environmentalists led to the development of the non-removable tabs used today. By 1980, his company was supplying can-end machinery worldwide making over $500 million in annual revenue.|$|E

5000|$|In 1959, Ermal <b>Fraze</b> {{devised a}} can-opening method {{that would come}} to {{dominate}} the canned beverage market. His invention was the [...] "pull-tab". This eliminated {{the need for a}} separate opener tool by attaching an aluminum pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted {{to the center of the}} top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the beverage flow out while air flowed in. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. <b>Fraze</b> had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab. [...] Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were also called [...] "pop-tops" [...] colloquially. In Australia these were colloquially known as [...] "ring-pull". Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them.These problems were both addressed by the invention of the [...] "push-tab". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminum blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening. An unusual feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent — a convenience that was lost with the switch from can opener to pull-tab. The [...] "push-tab" [...] was introduced into Australia in the early 1980s and was locally known as [...] "pop-tops".|$|E

50|$|Shivneri {{is known}} to be a place of Buddhist {{dominion}} from the 1st century AD. The caves, rock-cut architecture and water system indicate presence of habitation from the 1st century. Shivneri got its name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. This fort was mainly used to guard the old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. The place passed on to the hands of Bahami kings after the weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century. In 1595, Maratha chief Maloji Bhosale, the grandfather of Shivaji Maharaj, was enabled by Bahami king Bahadur Nizam Shah II and gave him the inter-alia Shivner and Chakan. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood there. Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to the goddess Shivai Devi, after whom Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was named. The English traveller <b>Fraze</b> visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible. According to his accounts the fort was well-stocked to feed thousand families for seven years. He also made a mention that the fort was then governed by a Brahmin turned Muslim. The fort was {{under the control of the}} Mughals after the Marathas and Sahu demanded it back in 1716.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{internet}} on inter-firm relationships has received little attention in the academic literature. This theory building research develops a conceptual framework about internet-facilitated relationships based on the literature and research findings from convergent interviews. The convergent {{interviews were conducted with}} CEOs and/or marketing managers of 10 Australian service companies. Results show that the internet does not appear to hinder inter-firm relationships as the internet is not being used at the expense of more traditional and personal forms of communication and has little impact on the level of trust in internet exchange partners and the dependence they have on one another at this relatively early stage of adoption. Rather, internet use is thought to be linked with improved business performance and satisfaction with the exchange partner’s performance.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{and impact of}} the Internet on the business-to-business market is widely acknowledged. However, little academic {{attention has been paid}} to the adoption of Internet-based technology in the Australian franchising sector. Thus this paper addresses the problem: ‘how and why Australian franchise organisations use Internetbased technologies in their franchise systems?’ This research uses a two-stage research design to investigate the benefits and barriers associated with adopting Internet-based technologies in Australian franchise organisations. The findings will serve as the foundation for future empirical analyses. The findings reveal that adoption of Internet technologies is still in its infancy in Australian franchise systems with the major uses of franchisor websites being providing information to consumers and as a means of attracting potential franchisees. The current study contributes to the scant literature on the use of franchisor websites and their role in network behaviour. The positive views on the Internet expressed by franchisors indicate that increasing use of Internet-based technologies will occur in the future and guarantee further research in this emerging area.

40|$|The {{relation}} of self-efficacy and assertiveness to {{the willingness of}} wom-en to engage in traditional or nontraditional career activities was studied. One hundred and twenty-two undergraduate females took the Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale (Taylor & Betz, 1983) and the Asser-tive Behavior Assessment for Women (Osborn & Harris, 1975) {{and were asked to}} rate their willingness to engage in the career-related activities of ten traditional and ten nontraditional occupations for women. Strong self-efficacy expectations and assertiveness were related to the willing-ness to engage in the career-related activities of nontraditional occupa-tions, but not traditional ones. However, regardless of level of self-efficacy or of assertiveness, women were more willing to engage in the career-related activities of traditional occupations. Implications of the results for career counseling are discussed. As increasing numbers of women enter the job market (Best, 1981) they are able to choose from a wider array of career options than their counterparts of the past. Today’s women can consider jobs that are either traditional or nontraditional for women. Traditional jobs are ones such as nurse, elemen-tary school teacher, and secretary.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 27, 000 {{children under}} the age of 20 years who live on farms and ranches are injured in farm accidents each year. This figure does not include children who visit or work on non-family farms. The total injury toll has been estimated at greater than 100, 000 annually (National Farm Medicine Center, 1996). Considering that secondary agricultural education programs have over 700, 000 students enrolled per year, what specific agricultural and farm safety topics should agricultural educators teach in order to lower the number of farm injuries experienced by youth? Many of the recommendations from earlier research completed in the profession have applicability in farm settings. For example, recom endations by Lawver and <b>Fraze</b> (1995), Swan (1993), and Miller (1995) have informed the teaching practices of teachers in agricultural mechanics laboratories about student attitudes concerning safety and the effects of exposure to magnetic fields. However, there remains a limited amount of knowledge concerning what stakeholders, other than researchers or teacher educators, desire in farm safety instruction for youth. In order to determine the content of farm safety instructional programming, one must be aware of the context of the involvement of youth in agriculture as well as the nature and magnitude of their injuries. First of all, children make up a significant portion of the work force in agriculture. Children of any age may be employed by their parent in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by their parent in accordance with Child Labor Bulletin No. 102 (Swanson, Sachs, Dahlgren, and Tinguely, 1987).

In this article, the mechanism, the technique, the implementation, and the testing of CreaStim are described. The basic principle of CreaStim is the catastrophe theory, which implies that sudden realization in the thinking process of design may lead to creativity. CreaStim tries to stimulate and 0 or impact designers’ creativity in design process using the output of it, rather than to simulate the sudden realization. The core of the CreaStim is a neural network-based imagining engine, a data repository, and its learning strategies considering psychological factors. The psychological factors, which are thought one of the key influences to creative design, are based on the questionnaires completed by designers about the existing successful designs. The repository contains not only a traditional database storing functional attributes, economic attributes, graphic description, structural description, and psychological attributes, but also methods, rule-based knowledge, and pattern-type knowledge. And it is managed by an application program called Design Template Group ~DTG! manager. Trained with 12 pieces of successful pattern designs and 528 pieces of pseudo-examples produced and evaluated by the authors, CreaStim is implemented for a PC and an evaluation poll from five designers shows that designers may most likely get some inspiration from the produced patterns and some of them can even be adopted as the design alternatives directly.

40|$|English as an {{analytic}} language particularly poor in inflections {{and relatively}} poor in derivational suffixes does not often mark word classes by specific morphemes. On the contrary, {{one form of}} a word {{can be used in}} several grammatical functions, and an identical word form can have several meanings in several word classes. The frequent occurrence of conversion between word classes thus allows one form, often the base or simplest one, to perform several roles, and, at the same time, makes identification of its grammatically and semantically defined word class difficult, especially in multiword phrases functioning as a whole. The most frequent type of a noun phrase, Attr+N phrase, can thus be realised in several ways, with different word classes performing the function of syntactic attribute. This paper looks into a less frequent subtype of this phrase in English, one which uses semantically (de) verbal attribute, and tries to establish rules governing the choice between the two main options, using either the base form or a derived one (e. g., call centre vs. writing paper). Shedding light on this issue has practical application in mastering appropriate formation as well as correct understanding of English multiword phrases or terms (mostly nominal), which is an important skill in a non-native environment (especially in EAP) where English is used as a lingua franca. Angličtina jako analytický jazyk, který je velmi chudý na gramatické koncovky a nedisponuje ani mnoha odvozovacími příponami, často nenaznačuje slovní druh specifickými morfémy. Naopak, jedna forma slova může být užita v několika gramatických funkcích a identický tvar slova může mít několik významů v různých slovních druzích. Častý výskyt kconverze mezi slovními druhy tedy umožňuje, aby jeden tvar slova, často ten základní, zastával několik rolí, a současně tak komplikuje identifikaci jeho gramatické a sémantické funkce, a to zejména ve víceslovných frázích. Nejčastější typ jmenné <b>fráze,</b> Attr+N, tak může být tvořena několika způsoby, přičemž syntaktický atribut je realizován různými slovními druhy. Tento text se zabývá méně častým podtypem této <b>fráze</b> v angličtině, která používá sémanticky (de) verbální atribut, a snaží se definovat pravidla, jež řídí výběr ze dvou hlavních možností, a to ze základního, anebo z odvozeného (sufixovaného) tvaru (např. call centre vs. writing paper). Osvětlení tohoto problému má praktické využití při zvládnutí náležité slovotvorby stejně jako pro správné pochopení anglických víceslovných frází či termínů (většinou jmenných), což je důležitá dovednost v prostředí, kde se angličtina používá jako tzv. lingua franca.
