60|$|THE chief {{object in}} this chapter is to show how powerfully the salts of ammonia act on the leaves of Drosera, and more {{especially}} to show what an extraordinarily small quantity suffices to excite inflection. I shall, therefore, be compelled to enter into full details. <b>Doubly</b> <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> was always used; and for the more delicate experiments, water which had been prepared with the utmost possible care was given me by Professor Frankland. The graduated measures were tested, and found as accurate as such measures can be. The salts were carefully weighed, and in all the more delicate experiments, by Borda's double method. But extreme accuracy would have been superfluous, as the leaves differ greatly in irritability, according to age, condition, and constitution. Even the tentacles on the same leaf differ in irritability to a marked degree. My experiments were tried in the following several ways.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{experiments were}} tried {{during the summer}} of 1873, by placing the leaves, each in a separate watch-glass and pouring over it thirty minims (1.775 ml.) of the solution; other leaves being treated in exactly the same manner with the <b>doubly</b> <b>distilled</b> <b>water</b> used in making the solutions. The trials above given were made several years before, and when I read over my notes, I could not believe in the results; so I resolved to begin again with moderately strong solutions. Six leaves were first immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the nitrate to 8750 of water (1 gr. to 20 oz.), so that each received 1/320 of a grain (.2025 mg.). Before 30 m. had elapsed, four of these leaves were immensely, and two of them moderately, inflected. The glands were rendered of a dark red. The four corresponding leaves in water were not at all affected until 6 hrs. had elapsed, and then only the short tentacles on the borders of the disc; and their inflection, as previously explained, is never of any significance.|$|E

40|$|Ribosomal {{preparations}} {{obtained from}} Salmonella typhimurium by differential centrifugation and {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) treatment of the bacillary lysate {{were found to be}} immunogenic in F 1 hybrid (C 3 H/HeJ × DBA/ 2 J) and albino Swiss mice, as determined by progressive host survival. The immunity obtained was independent of the need for adjuvant and dependent on the dosage of immunogen given. Immunizations with the ribosomal preparations induced an immune response comparable to that obtained by vaccination with living organisms and significantly greater than that obtained by immunization with heat-killed salmonellae, purified lipopolysaccharide, or crude and SDS-treated endotoxin preparations. No effect on the immunogenicity of the ribosomal fraction was observed by enzymatic treatment with trypsin, Pronase, deoxyribonuclease, and pancreatic ribonuclease. Linear sucrose density gradient resolution of the preparations showed that the immunogenicity of the ribosomal fraction was not unique to any one of its subcomponents. Ethyl alcohol-precipitated, crude ribonucleic acid preparations obtained from the ribosomal and sucrose density-resolved ribosomal preparations were found to induce an immune response comparable to that obtained by immunization with the entire ribosomal fraction. Dialysis in <b>doubly</b> <b>distilled</b> demineralized <b>water</b> slightly reduced the immunogenicity of the preparation; however, comparable dialysis in 10 − 4 m MgCl 2 -phosphate buffer did not.
