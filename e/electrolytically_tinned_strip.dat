40|$|Cementation of tin on copper in acid chloride-thiourea {{solutions}} {{leads to}} the formation of porous layers with a thickness dependent on the immersion time. The process occurs via Sn(II) -Cu(I) mechanism. Chemical <b>stripping</b> of <b>tin</b> was carried out in alkaline and acid solutions in the presence of oxidizing agents. It resulted in the dissolution of metallic tin, but refractory Cu 3 Sn phase remained on the copper surface. Electrochemical <b>tin</b> <b>stripping</b> allows complete <b>tin</b> removal from the copper substrate, but porosity and complex phase composition of the tin coating do not allow monitoring the process in unambiguous way...|$|R

40|$|The Sn/Sn(II) {{couple is}} {{studied in the}} room {{temperature}} ionic liquids N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide, [C(4) mpyrr][N(CN) (2) ] and N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [C(4) mpyrr][NTf(2) ] using cyclic voltammetry. The Sn(II) species is introduced into each of the ionic liquids by dissolving either SnCl(2) or Sn(CF(3) SO(3)) (2). The diffusion coefficient of the Sn(II) species produced is found to vary with the ionic liquid, partly reflecting {{the difference in the}} viscosity of the two liquids, but also to vary with the Sn(II) salts used, indicating that different Sn(II) species may be present. The mechanism for the <b>stripping</b> of deposited <b>tin</b> is found to change with potential and also vary with the Sn(II) salt/ionic liquid combination used. In [C(4) mpyrr][N(CN) (2) ] the mechanism for the <b>tin</b> <b>stripping</b> process is broadly similar for both of the Sn(II) salts used indicating that the morphology of the tin deposit is similar and that the stripping mechanism is largely independent of the Sn(II) salt anion. In [C(4) mpyrr][NTf(2) ] a large difference was seen in the voltammetry of the different Sn(II) salts. Tafel analysis is used to show that the mechanism of the oxidation of Sn is sensitive to the solvent, the salt and the potential. The rate determining step was found to vary between the first electron transfer, the second electron transfer and a step likely involving reactions of a Sn(+) intermediate...|$|R
40|$|Electronics is an {{important}} industry in the UK, as there are many home-grown manufacturing companies {{in the areas of}} optics, electronics and micro-systems. As a consequence of the growth in this industry, there has been an increase in the discharges from manufacturing. A process that could reclaim the metals contained in these wastes is desirable because of the increasing costs of raw materials and environmental compliance. The aim of this project was to develop a systematic method to determine the feasibility of metal recovery from aqueous solutions. Waste <b>tin</b> <b>stripping</b> solution was chosen as a case study. This waste arises from a stage in the manufacture of printed circuit boards when a protective <b>tin</b> layer is <b>stripped</b> from the copper pattern. The solution is mainly nitric acid, but also contains suspension agents, ferric salts and inhibitors. After use it also contains suspended tin oxide and dissolved copper. It has been suggested that the tin and copper could be recovered from this waste by electrodeposition. Initially the thermodynamics of the system were studied, followed by experiments to verify the theoretical work. Pourbaix diagrams were constructed to determine when the metals would be in the solid or liquid phase depending on the concentration of metal and anion, pH and system potential. This information was then compared to separation processes to determine or confirm the recovery route. This study showed that the dissolved copper and suspended tin oxide could be separated by filtration if the pH was maintained between - 0. 4 and 2. 4. The dissolved copper could then be removed by electrodeposition. After the metal recovery route has been established, the individual stages are studied in more detail. In this project the feasibility of copper recovery from the stripping waste was examined. Copper deposition occurs concurrently with nitrate, ferric and hydrogen reductions. Using a parallel plate electrochemical reactor, the copper concentration was reduced by approximately 30 %, at a current efficiency of 70 %.

50|$|The German bombers were afforded some {{protection}} {{in the form of}} the new, mid-VHF band FuG 216 Neptun radar system, usable both as an airborne intercept system (as a replacement for the post-July 1944 compromised Lichtenstein SN-2 system) and as a tail-warning radar, which could detect approaching RAF night fighters from the rear. To confuse British radars further various medium bomber types were equipped with Kettenhund radar jammers, specifically carried in the Ju 88, which had some effect in jamming the SCR-268 long-wave gun laying radar used by anti-aircraft artillery but was ineffective in countering microwave-frequency radars. German bombers also used Düppel (chaff) techniques to confound British ground radar as they approached the British coast. The <b>tin</b> foil <b>strips</b> swamped the radar screens and masked the true height, direction and speed of approaching bombers.|$|R

40|$|A {{method was}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} antimony, copper, lead and tin in white metal with anion exchange column. 　After 0. 15 g of sample had been dissolved in aqua regia,the obtained solution was treated to remove any nitrogen oxides and made up to 250 ml exactly with 1 N HCl solution. 　 25 ml of the solution was poured into the anion exchange column(Dowex 1 -X 4, 6. 0 g), which had been conditioned with 1 N HCl solution. Copper and antimony were eluted with 100 ml of 1 N HCl solution, while lead and tin were retained on the column. The eluate was concentrated to about one-fourth of its original volume in order that its HCl concentration was made 4 N. The concentrated solution was poured into the another column(Dowex 1 -X 4, 8. 0 g), which had been conditioned with 4 N HCl solution. Copper was eluted with 100 ml of 4 N HCl solution and then antimony was done with 200 ml of 4 N HCl solution.

40|$|<b>Tin</b> electrocoated steel <b>strip,</b> also {{referred}} to as Flandres foil, is largely used for manufacturing food containers. Tinplates must have good corrosion resistance, workability, weldability, as well as a bright appearance. The woodgrain defect, a not yet fully understood defect that occurs on tinplates and accounts for their high scrap rate, consists of alternate bands of bright/dull reflectivity and resembles longitudinally cut wood. Observations of the woodgrain defect by scanning electron microscopy showed that the molten tin spreads irregularly during both the melting and solidification stages. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the metallic tin tended to crystallize in the (200) direction for coupons with and without the woodgrain defect. Nevertheless, the preferential orientation degree decreased for coupons with the woodgrain defect. The rocking curves, also known as omega-scan, showed that the tin grains were uniformly aligned parallel to the strip surface for coupons with no defects, whereas for tinplates with woodgrain, the tin grains were not uniformly oriented, probably due to the misalignment of the grains in relation to the surface.

40|$|World steel trade {{becomes more}} {{competitive}} {{every day and}} new high international quality standards and productivity levels can only be achieved by applying the latest computational technologies. Data driven analysis of complex processes is necessary in many industrial applications where analytical modeling is not possible. This paper presents the deployment of KDD technology in one real industrial problem: {{the development of new}} tinplate quality diagnostic models. The electrodeposition of <b>tin</b> on steel <b>strips</b> is the most critical stage of a complex process that involves a great amount of variables and operating conditions. Its optimization is not only a great commercial and economic challenge but also a compulsion due to the social impact of the tinplate product-more than 90 % of the production is used for food packaging. The necessary certification with standards, like ISO 9000, requires the use of diagnostic models to minimize the costs and the environmental impact. This aim has been achieved following the multi-stage DM methodology CRISP-DM and a novel application of pro-active maintenance methods, as FMEA, for the identification of the specific process anomalies. Three DM tools have been used {{for the development of the}} models. The final results include two ANN tinplate quality diagnostic models, that provide the estimated quality of the final product just seconds after its production and only based on the process data. The results have much better performance than the classical Faraday’s models widely used for the estimation...|$|R
