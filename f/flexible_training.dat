40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Flexible</b> <b>training</b> {{options are}} sought by an {{increasing}} number of Australasian surgical trainees. Reasons include increased participation of women in the surgical workforce, postgraduate training and changing attitudes to family responsibilities. Despite endorsement of <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Board in General Surgery, part-time (PT) training in General Surgery in Australia and New Zealand is not well established. A permanent ‘stand-alone’ PT training position was established at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2007 under the Surgical Education and Training Program. This position offered 12 months of General Surgical training on a 0. 5 full-time (FT) equivalent basis with pro rata emergency and on-call commitments and was accredited for 6 months of General Surgical training. This paper reviews the PT training experience in South Australia. METHODS De-identified logbook data were obtained from the South Australian Regional Subcommittee of the Board in General Surgery with consent of each of the trainees. Totals of operative cases were compared against matched FT trainees working on the same unit. RESULTS Overall, PT trainees achieved comparable operative caseloads compared with their FT colleagues. All trainees included in this review have subsequently passed the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Fellowship Examination in General Surgery and returned to FT workforce positions. CONCLUSION This paper presents two validated models of PT training. Training, resource and regulatory requirements and individual and institutional barriers to <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> are substantial. Successful PT models offer positive and beneficial training alternatives for General Surgical trainees and contribute to workforce flexibility.

40|$|AbstractDomain-specific {{computer-aided}} {{analysis of}} technical systems has become well-established. Nominal and {{worst case scenario}} behavior of systems can be modelled sufficiently, however, still lacking the ability of simulating the behavior of technical systems as a whole, combining single-domain subsystems. Therefore, unpredictable failure can occur, which displays the demand for computer-aided system analysis. To counteract the foresaid, a concept has been proposed, which enables sufficient designing and implementing a highly flexible model landscape. It serves the process from comprehending a technical system's specifications and functions towards an executable model structure, using the Modelica-based modelling software SimulationX. Since its future application remains to be tested in the aftermath, the concept will exemplarily be applied on a <b>flexible</b> <b>train</b> simulator...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of traffic information {{is important in}} many applications in relation to Intelligent Transport systems (ITS), since it reduces the uncertainty of future traffic states and improves traffic mobility. There {{is a lot of}} research done in the field of traffic information predictions such as speed, flow and travel time. The most important research was done in the domain of cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS). The goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce the novel cooperation behaviour profile prediction through the example of <b>flexible</b> Road <b>Trains</b> useful road cooperation parameter, which contributes to the improvement of traffic mobility in Intelligent Transportation Systems. This paper presents an approach towards the control and cooperation behaviour modelling of vehicles in the <b>flexible</b> Road <b>Train</b> based on hybrid automaton and neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) {{prediction of}} cooperation profile of the <b>flexible</b> Road <b>Train.</b> Hybrid automaton takes into account complex dynamics of each vehicle as well as discrete cooperation approach. The ANFIS is a particular class of the ANN family with attractive estimation and learning potentials. In order to provide statistical analysis, RMSE (root mean square error), coefficient of determination (R 2) and Pearson coefficient (r), were utilized. The study results suggest that ANFIS would be an efficient soft computing methodology, which could offer precise predictions of cooperative interactions between vehicles in Road Train, which is useful for prediction mobility in Intelligent Transport systems...|$|R
