25|$|Mercy Medical Center {{is home to}} the Leonard P. Nelson <b>Family</b> <b>Cancer</b> Treatment Center (est. 1996), {{providing}} oncology {{services in}} the region for the past seventeen years to an area of a 100-mile radius. Patients receive treatment {{for a wide variety of}} cancers including breast, gynecologic, head and neck, lung and prostate. Mercy Medical Center broke ground 24 August 2012 on an expanded cancer treatment facility. Improvements include the installation of a highly specialized linear accelerator to increase precision radiation therapy treatment delivery with decreased patient treatment time. The grand opening was 7 October 2013.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, Seattle-based Sisters of Providence Health System, {{which owns}} St. Joseph in Burbank, renamed the {{hospital}} Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. The medical center has several centers on campus with specialized disciplines. Cancer, cardiology, mammogram, hospice and children's services {{are some of}} the specialty centers. The newest addition to the medical center's offerings is the Roy and Patricia Disney <b>Family</b> <b>Cancer</b> Center, which opened in February 2010. The cancer center features four stories of the latest in high-tech equipment to treat cancer patients and provide wellness services. The center, estimated to cost in excess of $36 million, was built with money from the family of Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt Disney. Roy E. Disney died in December 2009 of stomach cancer.|$|E

If that argument is good, then {{it would be a good}} argument not to banish the flies and the cockroaches from hospitals because they have been there so long that the patients have got used to them and they feel a tenderness for them on account of the associations. Why, it is like preserving a cancer in a family because it is a <b>family</b> <b>cancer,</b> and we are bound to it by the test of affection and reverence and old, mouldy antiquity.|$|E

40|$|Genetic endowments play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} production of health. At birth individuals have different capacities to be healthy, largely due to genetic dispositions. Whether or not individuals realize this health depends on their choice of health behaviours. Previous research has linked negative factors beyond the individual's control, which include genetic endowments, to both poor health and poor health behaviours. The health economics literature proposes that behaviours and genetic (or family health) endowments can be either substitutes or complements in the production of health. The goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate the behavioural consequences of changes in knowledge about one's genetic endowment. Using two waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Followup Study, I find that for smokers, smoking intensity substitutes for newly diagnosed smoking-related <b>family</b> <b>cancers,</b> while smoking intensity is complementary to newly diagnosed non-smoking-related <b>family</b> <b>cancers.</b> I find no evidence for the hypothesized relationships with respect to alcohol consumption among drinkers. These results have implications for the growing field of genetic testing and test development. These results also reinforce current practices of ascertaining family health histories in the context of medical history taking. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
