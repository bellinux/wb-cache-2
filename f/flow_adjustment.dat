40|$|Abstract. The layered {{recovery}} {{technology has}} been applied to the heterogeneous multi-layer standstone oilfields for many years. However, as these standstone oilfields have been entering into the ultra-high water cut period, the conventional layered water injection technology has too long test and adjustment period and heavy workload and cannot determine the reservoir condition. To solve this problem, this paper proposes and develops an intelligent multi-layer water injection technology suitable for the ultra-high water cut period based on the synchronous dynamic test and adjustment idea. The whole <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> process has no any intervention and the synchronous dynamic <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> of each layer finishes by the digital clock calibration thereby avoiding interlayer interference. This technology also can obtain data by the redisplay of computer. The experimental results show that this technology not only improves water injection effect and reduces the field workload, but also provides the basis of data analysis for implementation and adjustment of meticulous oil development plan. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{splitting}} rate model {{proposed by}} Smith and Mounce (2011) establishes a traffic evolution process on a link-node network representation, which overcomes {{the difficulties in}} applying traditional path-based models and provides the ease of implementing controls at nodes. While their model offers a new method for modeling traffic evolution, it contains an ad-hoc step of <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> to preserve the flow conservation. This <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> step leads to difficulties in analyzing the system properties. This paper proposes a generalized flow splitting model for day-to-day traffic assignment based {{on the concept of}} splitting flow at nodes. The proposed model preserves the flow conservation endogenously by introducing the inflow variable into the formulation. The generalized formulation provides the ease to construct a variety of day-to-day traffic assignment models, and serves as a framework for analyzing the models’ properties, such as the invariance property and the preservation of the Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity. Specifically, a proportional-adjustment model and a projection-type model are developed based on the proposed generalized formulation. A numerical example demonstrates the ease of implementing the proposed generalized model, as well as its convergence to user equilibrium...|$|E

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} inviscid DENTON code is used {{to analyze}} flow through a radial-inflow turbine rotor. Experimental data from the rotor are compared with analytical results obtained by using the code. The experimental data available for comparison are the radial distributions of circumferentially averaged values of absolute flow angle and total pressure downstream of the rotor exit. The computed rotor-exit flow angles are generally underturned relative to the experimental values, which reflect the boundary-layer separation at the trailing edge {{and the development of}} wakes downstream of the rotor. The experimental rotor is designed for a higher-than-optimum work factor of 1. 126 resulting in a nonoptimum positive incidence and causing a region of rapid <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> and large velocity gradients. For this experimental rotor, the computed radial distribution of rotor-exit to turbine-inlet total pressure ratios are underpredicted due to the errors in the finite-difference approximations in the regions of rapid <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and due to using the relatively coarser grids {{in the middle of the}} blade region where the flow passage is highly three-dimensional. Additional results obtained from the three-dimensional inviscid computation are also presented, but without comparison due to the lack of experimental data. These include quasi-secondary velocity vectors on cross-channel surfaces, velocity components on the meridional and blade-to-blade surfaces, and blade surface loading diagrams. Computed results show the evolution of a passage vortex and large streamline deviations from the computational streamwise grid lines.

40|$|The {{transport}} of fine sediment and organic matter {{plays an important}} role in the nutrient dynamics of shallow aquatic systems, and the fate of these particles is closely linked to vegetation. We describe the mean and turbulent flow near circular patches of synthetic vegetation and examine how the spatial distribution of flow is connected to the spatial distribution of suspended sediment deposition. Patches of rigid, emergent, and flexible, submerged vegetation were considered, with two different stem densities. For the rigid emergent vegetation, <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> was primarily two-dimensional, with flow deflected in the horizontal plane. Horizontal shear layers produced a von Kármán vortex street. Flow through the patch shifted the vortex street downstream, resulting in a region directly downstream of the patch in which both the mean and turbulent velocities were diminished. Net deposition was enhanced within this region. In contrast, for the flexible, submerged vegetation, <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> was three-dimensional, with shear layers formed in the vertical and horizontal planes. Because of strong vertical circulation, turbulent kinetic energy was elevated directly downstream of the patch. Consistent with this, deposition was not enhanced at any point in the wake. This comparison suggests that morphological feedbacks differ between submerged and emergent vegetation. Further, enhanced deposition occurred only in regions where both turbulent and mean velocities were reduced, relative to the open channel. Reduced deposition (indicating enhanced resuspension) occurred in regions of high turbulence kinetic energy, regardless of local mean velocity. These observations highlight the importance of turbulence in controlling deposition. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (grant EAR 0738352) National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the transition from}} open channel flow to flow over submerged vegetation using velocity measurements collected with acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV). Submerged canopies were constructed from arrays of rigid circular cylinders of height h in water of depth H. Both the canopy density, described by the frontal area per volume (a), and degree of submergence (H/h) were varied. <b>Flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> occurs in three stages. First, velocity begins to decelerate upstream of the canopy, due to a high-pressure region generated at the canopy leading edge, and continues to decelerate within the canopy, due to canopy drag. Rapid flow deceleration within the canopy creates strong vertical flux out through {{the top of the}} canopy that extends over a length proportional to the canopy drag length scale, (CDa) − 1, with CD being the canopy drag coefficient. Second, a mixing layer develops at the canopy interface, with the stress {{at the top of the}} canopy initially increasing, but eventually reaching a constant value. At this point, the flow within the canopy is fully developed. The length scale for mixing-layer development is related to canopy drag (CDa) and the depth ratio (H/h). In the third stage, the boundary layer above the mixing layer adjusts to the channel boundary conditions. A model is developed to predict the adjustment of vertically averaged velocity within the canopy. Measurements confirm that the <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> is not dependent on canopy length.

40|$|Infrared {{thermography}} is a {{non-invasive technique}} that measures mid to long-wave infrared radiation emanating from all objects and converts this to temperature. As an imaging technique, {{the value of}} modern infrared thermography {{is its ability to}} produce a digitized image or high speed video rendering a thermal map of the scene in false colour. Since temperature is an important environmental parameter influencing animal physiology and metabolic heat production an energetically expensive process, measuring temperature and energy exchange in animals is critical to understanding physiology, especially under field conditions. As a non-contact approach, infrared thermography provides a non-invasive complement to physiological data gathering. One caveat, however, is that only surface temperatures are measured, which guides much research to those thermal events occurring at the skin and insulating regions of the body.
