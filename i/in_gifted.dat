25|$|La Guardia was a domineering {{leader who}} verged on authoritarian but whose reform {{politics}} were carefully tailored {{to address the}} sentiments of his diverse constituency. He defeated a corrupt Democratic machine, presided during a depression and a world war, made the city the model for New Deal welfare and public works programs, and championed immigrants and ethnic minorities. He succeeded {{with the support of}} a sympathetic president. He secured his place in history as a tough-minded reform mayor who helped clean out corruption, brought <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> experts, and fixed upon the city a broad sense of responsibility for its own citizens. His administration engaged new groups that had been kept out of the political system, gave New York its modern infrastructure, and raised expectations of new levels of urban possibility.|$|E

2500|$|Based on data {{collected}} in 1921–22, Terman concluded that gifted children suffered no more health problems than normal for their age, save {{a little more}} myopia than average. [...] He {{also found that the}} children were usually social, were well-adjusted, did better in school, and were even taller than average. A follow-up performed in 1923–1924 found that the children had maintained their high IQs and were still above average overall as a group. Data collected in the 1920s also including a pioneering effort to implement above-level testing on a large scale, a practice that is widespread <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> education today.|$|E
5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants <b>in</b> school <b>gifted</b> education programs. <b>In</b> practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion <b>in</b> school <b>gifted</b> programs.|$|R

2500|$|Gifted {{students}} are {{pulled out of}} a heterogeneous classroom to spend {{a portion of their}} time in a gifted class. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum. [...] The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced <b>in</b> <b>Gifted</b> pull-out programs deals with the study of Logic, and its application to fields ranging from Philosophy to Mathematics. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and outside of class. In some elementary classes such as math, students divide classes based on level: highest (gifted), median and lowest.|$|E

Boris is a [...] "say {{it like it is}} or say nothing at all" [...] sort of guy.

2500|$|In 2010, Gifted, a {{novel by}} New Zealand {{academic}} and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans, was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The story is a fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his Takapuna property in 1955–56 – an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campion's film, An Angel At My Table (1990). In 2013, Evans' novel was adapted for the stage, premiering at the Christchurch Arts Festival on 22 August 2013, followed by extended tour of New Zealand's north and south islands. While garnering positive critical reviews, the promotion and staging of the production drew fierce criticism from Frame's literary executor and niece, Pamela Gordon, who maintained it [...] "was designed to demean Frame." [...] Gordon, who has also criticised Campion's film for inaccuracies in its portrayal of Frame, asserted that Evans' theatrical adaptation presented an unfaithful view of her famous relative. Festival organiser Philip Tremewan, defended the play, while director Conrad Newport maintained that Gordon was [...] "overprotective of [...] legacy." [...] Evans generally avoided the controversy, stating, [...] "I have publicised her work and popularised it for two to three generations of students. <b>In</b> <b>Gifted,</b> the play and novel, you only {{have to look at the}} title to see what my attitude is. I really don't think I have anything to apologise for." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} three {{aspects of the}} clustering strategy used by participants: the differences of clustering strategy between intellectually gifted and average children; the relationship between clustering strategy and recall performance <b>in</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> and average children; and the differences in recall performance on collaborative recall task of intellectually gifted and average children. Thirty-eight intellectually gifted and 44 intellectually average children were recruited, and their collaborative and individual recall performances were tested. The results showed that intellectually gifted children had better clustering strategy than their peers when adjusted ratio of clustering scores were calculated (p <. 01); clustering strategy positively correlated with recall performance in intellectually average children (p <. 05), while no such correlation was found <b>in</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> children (p =. 95); there was no collaborative inhibition <b>in</b> the <b>gifted</b> group (p =. 82). These findings partly resolve the conflicts in individual research and expand on the conclusions regarding collaborative memory. </p...|$|R
6000|$|Not {{altogether}} so; but {{indeed the}} Vocal piety seemed conclusively to have retired (or excursed?) into that mossy hermitage, above Little Langdale. The Unvocal piety, with the uncomplaining sorrow, of Man, {{may have a}} somewhat wider range, for aught we know: but history disregards those items; and of firmly proclaimed and sweetly canorous religion, there really seemed at that juncture none to be reckoned upon, east of Ingleborough, or north of Criffel. Only under Furness Fells, or by Bolton Priory, it seems we can still write Ecclesiastical Sonnets, stanzas on the force of Prayer, Odes to Duty, and complimentary addresses to the Deity upon His endurance for adoration. Far otherwise, over yonder, by Spezzia Bay, and Ravenna Pineta, and in ravines of Hartz. There, the softest voices speak the wildest words; and Keats discourses of Endymion, Shelley of Demogorgon, Goethe of Lucifer, and Burger of the Resurrection of Death unto Death--while even Puritan Scotland and Episcopal Anglia produce for us only these three minstrels of doubtful tone, who show but small respect for the [...] "unco guid," [...] put but limited faith <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> Gilfillan, and translate with unflinching frankness the Morgante Maggiore.[74] ...|$|E
