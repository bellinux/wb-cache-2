40|$|The {{infrared}} array {{referred to}} as Big Mac (for Marshall Array Camera), was designed for ground based astronomical observations in the wavelength range 5 to 35 microns. It contains 20 discrete gallium-doped germanium bolometer detectors at a temperature of 1. 4 K. Each bolometer is irradiated by a square field mirror constituting a single pixel of the array. The mirrors are arranged contiguously in four columns and five rows, thus defining the array configuration. Big Mac utilized cold reimaging optics and an up looking dewar. The total Big Mac system also contains a telescope <b>interface</b> <b>tube</b> for mounting the dewar and a computer for data acquisition and processing. Initial astronomical observations at a major infrared observatory indicate that Big Mac performance is excellent, having achieved the design specifications and making this instrument an outstanding tool for astrophysics...|$|E
40|$|With {{the arrival}} of highly {{accurate}} multi-port pressure measurement systems, conditions that previously did not affect overall system accuracy must now be scrutinized closely. Errors caused by elevation differences between pressure sensing elements and model pressure taps can be quantified and corrected. With multi-port pressure measurement systems, the sensing elements are connected to pressure taps that may be many feet away. The measurement system may be at a different elevation than the pressure taps due to laboratory space or test article constraints. This difference produces a pressure gradient that is inversely proportional to height within the <b>interface</b> <b>tube.</b> The pressure {{at the bottom of}} the tube will be higher than the pressure at the top due to the weight of the tube's column of air. Tubes with higher pressures will exhibit larger absolute errors due to the higher air density. The above effect is well documented but has generally been taken into account with large elevations only. With error analysis techniques, the loss in accuracy from elevation can be easily quantified. Correction factors can be applied to maintain the high accuracies of new pressure measurement systems...|$|E

The bubble displaces a viscous, nonwetting uid, creating a thin film between its <b>interface</b> and the <b>tube</b> walls.

However, once intermolecular interactions are important, the interface is perturbed out of its steady state and either (i) the perturbation grows suficiently before reaching the rear meniscus of the bubble such that rupture occurs; or (ii) the perturbation remains small due to weak intermolecular forces until it leaves the bubble interface through the rear meniscus. We obtain, both numerically and asymptotically, the time-scale over which rupture occurs, and thus, we find a critical capillary number, depending on the bubble length and the strength of the intermolecular forces, below which the film is predicted to rupture...|$|R

This work points out that mineral particles associated with Pompeii worm (A. pompejana and A. caudata) tubes constitute useful markers for evaluating the chemical characteristics of their micro-environment. The minerals associated with these worm tubes were analysed on samples recovered from an experimental alvinellid colony, at different locations in the vent fluid-seawater <b>interface.</b> Inhabited <b>tubes</b> from the most upper and lower parts of the colony were analysed by light and electron microscopies, X-ray microanalysis and X-ray diffraction.

A similar gradient in proportions of minerals was observed at a decimeter scale from the lower to {{the upper part of}} the colony. The marcasitc/pyrite ratio of iron disulphides also displays a steep decrease along the few millimeters adjacent to the external tube surface. The occurrence of these gradients indicates that the microenvironment within the tube differs from that outside the tube, and suggests that the tube wall acts as an efficient barrier to the external environment.

Likewise, {{our understanding of the}} ethological interpretation of the trace fossil has evolved from gregarious headdown deposit feeders to filter feeders, until it recently was shown that the tracemaker probably was a funnel feeder. Although several ichnospecies were recently synonymized into one ichnospecies, Schaubcylindrichnus coronus, variability in the number of tubes per sheaf and abundance of nested tubes, i. e., tubes that break up older tubes, were observed between different settings. These differences were studied in close detail at Miocene outcrops in Japan and Taiwan where the trace fossil occurs copiously and therefore allows the intraspecific morphological variability to be addressed. Around 2000 specimens from Japan and Taiwan were studied. The results show a distinct tendency for higher tube numbers in the offshore facies where sediments are characterized by higher silt/mud content, suggesting that S. coronus with higher tube numbers were constructed in a calm environment allowing longer dwelling periods.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) are envisioned as ideal filaments for next-generation nanocomposites due {{to their}} high strength-to-weight ratios. However, while individual nanotubes are strong, <b>interfaces</b> between <b>tubes</b> cannot bear significant load due to the weak van der Waals forces that govern their behavior. Premature interfacial failure could thus counteract the inherent strength of carbon nanotubes and, in turn, prevent CNT-based composites from achieving optimal mechanical performance. To increase the load bearing capacity of these interfaces, interlayer crosslinking schemes have been proposed using chemical functionalization. For instance, introduction of hydrogen bonds or additional van der Waals bonds between tubes could improve load transfer between CNTs. While introducing chemical groups on CNT surfaces may enhance intermolecular interactions at these interfaces, a means of quantitatively evaluating changes in interlayer adhesion {{as a result of}} to these treatments needs to be defined. In addition, as sizes of CNTs will inherently vary within a composite, it is important that such energy measurements be normalized irrespective of tube dimensions. Here we report an experimental peeling technique {{that can be used to}} measure the adhesion energy between multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene. Peeling tests conducted in situ a scanning electron microscope allow direct visualization of the nanoscale peeling process which, in turn, enables adhesion energy to be estimated through classical fracture analysis. The applicability of this analysis is validated by finite element simulations with boundary conditions derived from experiments. The effective contact width between tubes and graphene is estimated via atomistic simulations, providing a means to normalize interaction energy per unit area. The surface energies of bare MWCNT-graphene interfaces found in this study compare favorably with theoretical and experimental values reported for graphite.

40|$|We have {{discovered}} a previously unidentified thermal explosion mode using the Los Alamos deflagration cylinder test (DFCT). The DFCT is a “pipe bomb”-style test similar to the detonation cylinder test (DTCT), which {{has been used for}} many years to calibrate detonation product equations of state. The shot is heated in an oven to a uniform test temperature. The pre-heated high explosive (HE) is triggered by a hot wire initiator on one end. The tube is back-illuminated by a bright light source, and its combustion-driven deformation and subsequent break-up are observed by a high-speed framing camera. Like the DTCT, the DFCT tube wall motion provides the primary diagnostic. A variety of reactive responses are possible, including quasi-steady deflagration and deflagration-to-detonation transition. This paper focuses on the behavior of the HMX-based explosive PBX 9501 at 155 C. Under this condition burning appeared to occur only at the HE/tube <b>interface,</b> causing the <b>tube</b> to peel away from the HE core. Peel-off propagated as a wave that traveled along the tube at ∼ 500 m/s. This failure mode resulted in vigorous case venting, but the response was otherwise benign. We derive a steady peel-off-wave model that reproduces the essential observed features for realistic PBX 9501 parameter values...|$|R
