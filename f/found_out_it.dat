25|$|Osbourne {{experienced}} tremors {{for some}} years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In May 2005, he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne {{will have to take}} daily medication {{for the rest of his}} life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they say. At the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.|$|E

500|$|After {{experiencing}} headaches {{upon his}} arrival to America, N'Diaye saw {{a doctor and}} {{it was discovered that}} he was suffering from a golf ball-sized tumor in his pituitary gland, which had caused his excessive growth and was threatening his vision. Afterwards, he recalled the moment, [...] "For me, it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t know what a tumor was. Once I <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> <b>it</b> was tough to hear I had one." [...] The condition was treated in the Hoag Memorial Hospital following several charitable donations from around the area. A married couple who lived in Huntington Beach, California, a city close to N'Diaye's future school, offered to become his guardians to ease his commute for medical treatment.|$|E
500|$|Riding {{the train}} were Ralph Budd, Edward G. Budd, H. L. Hamilton, {{president}} of the Winton Motor Company (at that time {{a part of the}} new General Motors Electro-Motive Division), a number of reporters, some Burlington employees, members of the public, and Zeph, a burro that was contributed by a Colorado newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News, as a mascot for the train. The newspaper had described Zeph to the railroad as a [...] "Rocky Mountain canary" [...] so the train's crew had originally planned only enough space for a birdcage; when they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was not a bird, the railroad hastily built a pen in the baggage section and bought some hay for it. When asked about the burro, Ralph Budd replied [...] "why not? One more jackass on this trip won't make a difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E

500|$|The writers {{also use}} the {{newsgroup}} to test how observant the fans are. In the seventh-season episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI", the writer of segment Homer3, David S. Cohen, deliberately inserted a false equation into the background of one scene. The equation that appears is 178212 + 184112 = 192212. Although a false statement, {{it appears to be}} true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision. If it were true, it would disprove Fermat's last theorem, which had just been proven when this episode first aired. Cohen generated this [...] "Fermat near-miss" [...] with a computer program. After the episode aired, Cohen lurked on the newsgroup to see the response; at first there was astonishment when users tested it, but later there was despair when they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was only accurate to eight decimal places when expressed in scientific notation.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as {{she said when she}} received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard his story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] to her than the Legion of Honour.|$|E
500|$|Titled Return to the Planet of the Apes, {{the project}} was put on fast track and almost entered pre-production. Rick Baker was hired to design the {{prosthetic}} makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score. Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role. [...] "I can't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt knowing that I, Adam Rifkin, {{was going to be}} resurrecting the Planet of the Apes. It all seemed too good to be true. I soon <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was." [...] Days before the film was to commence pre-production, new studio executives arrived at Fox, which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio. Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts. The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a Renaissance. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci-type character they had written for him. However, the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall's involvement in the series, and Jackson turned his attention back to Heavenly Creatures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story was}} created by Adams, who wrote the game's script with Michael Bywater and Neil Richards. Additional {{dialogue}} was written by D.A. Barham. [...] Adams's inspiration for the game, particularly the objective of upgrading from third to first-class, came from an experience with airline ticketing personnel, where {{he was told he}} would be given an upgrade from economy-class tickets upon arriving for his flight, but <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> had not been arranged upon arrival; he said the idea is {{based on the premise that}} [...] "everyone wants a free upgrade in life". Adams had devised a story concept to add an additional gameplay element where players would be able to enter the ship's data system as a [...] "full realtime, flyable environment" [...] and control how information flows through the vessel, but the idea was abandoned because, according to Adams, it was [...] "a bridge too far".|$|E

According to Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Steele: [...] "Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck -- I later <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head." [...] Corporal Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's death, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, [...] "What about the Lusitania, you bastard!" [...] An alternative account says that the Germans who boarded Nicosian were killed by the freighter's engine room staff; this report apparently came from the officer in command of the muleteers.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her marriage to Nick, Sharon became insecure and felt like she had to have a child so that Nick would stay tied to her. During this period, Nick hired Sharon's best friend from Madison Grace Turner (Josie Davis) to work at his father's company Newman Enterprises. Sharon became pregnant by deliberately skipping her contraceptive pills, which she confessed to Nikki. Nick asked Sharon to have an abortion. [...] Without his permission, she arranged to have an abortion to save her marriage. However, at the last minute, Nick realized he was wrong and stopped it from happening. Grace's old boyfriend Tony Viscardi (Nick Scotti) arrived in town but she resisted him because she began having fantasies about Nick. Their firstborn baby son Noah Christian Newman was born prematurely on March 3, 1997 after Sharon fell. Noah became ill and nearly died. Believing he would eventually die, Grace (now played by Jennifer Gareis) and Tony tracked down Sharon's long lost eight-year-old daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes) and brought her to town, believing it would help Sharon get through Noah's death. However, once Noah survived, Grace kept Cassie so she could raise her as her own, as her [...] "pet". She did this despite knowing very well Sharon was definitely Cassie's biological mother. [...] Nick became drunk one night after partying with his college friends, the same night Sharon was sick with a cold and Grace was babysitting Noah. Nick entered the nursery and had sex with Grace who he believed was Sharon, leaving him guilt-ridden after he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> wasn't.|$|E

2500|$|Singer Mike Patton {{was known}} {{to have had a}} bad {{relationship}} with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis, beginning when Kiedis saw Patton performing with Faith No More and accused him of imitating his style. California was scheduled to be released on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Kiedis had Mr. Bungle removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe; as the headlining act at the festivals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear. According to the band members themselves, Kiedis had never met or spoken to anyone involved with Mr. Bungle aside from Mike Patton. Patton explained to The A.V.
