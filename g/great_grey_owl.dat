5|$|Manitoba's bird {{diversity}} {{is enhanced by}} its position on two major migration routes, with 392 confirmed identified species; 287 of these nesting within the province. These include the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl,</b> the province's official bird, and the endangered peregrine falcon.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl,</b> willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl</b> and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} large size, <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owls</b> have few natural predators. Great horned owls, various small carnivores, and black bears have been {{documented}} preying on young, but such predators rarely threaten adults, and owls {{have been known to}} fend off animals as large as black bears when defending their nests. The only known predator of adult <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owls</b> is the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), which occasionally preys on the former in parts of Europe.|$|R
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl</b> are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the forest}} around the reservoir, there are black-billed magpies, common ravens, Brewer's blackbirds, {{northern}} flickers, rock doves, and mourning doves {{as well as}} downy woodpecker. Several owl species are found near the reservoir. [...] These include the great horned owl, <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl,</b> barn owl, and screech owl.

50|$|Although <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owls</b> {{are seldom}} preyed upon, nestlings and juveniles may {{fall prey to}} bears, fishers, and large hawks, {{especially}} Northern goshawks; while adults may fall prey to Bubo owls, golden eagles and lynxes.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{than these}} two species, {{a large share}} of the {{raptorial}} prey for eagle-owls is made up of other owls. Given that all European owls are to some extent nocturnal, they may be encountered and killed upon detection by the Eurasian eagle-owl. In Europe, it has killed every other species of owl, from the tiny pygmy owl and scops owl to the large [...] <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl</b> and the [...] snowy owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the only raptor that has been known to prey on snowy owl on [...] multiple occasions. However, the threat Eurasian eagle-owls poses to other raptors can be exaggerated. Occasionally, with adequate mammal prey populations, they can nest as close as a few dozen meters of other raptors and never harass them. When nesting in the same groves as the [...] long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus) in southeastern Bulgaria, Eurasian eagle-owls did not predate the buzzards at any point. Long-legged buzzards have been killed however in Kazakhstan. Even in those occasional cases where they pick off one or several raptors, they do not effect the overall population, unless the raptorial prey is already heavily diminished due to some other (often human-based) cause. For example, despite both being a known predator both, they did not significantly depress numbers of either northern goshawks or tawny owls in southern Finland. One study showed that many raptors engage in spatial avoidance during potential encounters with Eurasian eagle-owls and while the predation by eagle-owls did decrease raptor population densities, they seldom caused declines in breeding success or altered habitat occupancy.|$|E

50|$|This lack of {{territorial}} aggressiveness makes the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>owl</b> {{difficult to find}} in the field.
