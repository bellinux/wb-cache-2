25|$|SQL Native Client is {{the native}} client side data access library for Microsoft SQL Server, version 2005 onwards. It {{natively}} implements {{support for the}} SQL Server features including the Tabular Data Stream implementation, support for mirrored SQL Server databases, full support for all data types supported by SQL Server, asynchronous operations, query notifications, encryption support, as well as receiving multiple result sets in a single database session. SQL Native Client is used under the hood by SQL Server plug-ins for other data access technologies, including ADO or OLE DB. The SQL Native Client can also be directly used, bypassing the <b>generic</b> <b>data</b> access layers.|$|E

30|$|The {{three sets}} of {{experiments}} presented herein were designed {{with the intent to}} evaluate MAM built with the four node split policies regarding both querying and mining complex datasets. Our intention was to discuss node splitting policies that could be employed to build access methods for <b>generic</b> metric <b>data</b> spaces. This feature guided the selection of the baseline approaches employed in the experiments. The results obtained with our policies were compared with the former ones proposed for <b>generic</b> metric <b>data</b> spaces, which are MinMax, MST, and Random (see Table 1). All the policies evaluated were implemented within the same platform, using the C++ language into the Arboretum MAM library in order to obtain a fair comparison [24].|$|R

Given an extensible list of classes, this allows the classification of any individual thing and to specify part-whole relations for any individual object. By standardisation of an extensible list of relation types, a <b>generic</b> <b>data</b> model enables the expression of an unlimited number of kinds of facts and will approach the capabilities of natural languages.Conventional data models, on the other hand, have a fixed and limited domain scope, because the instantiation (usage) of such a model only allows expressions of kinds of facts that are predefined in the model.|$|E
