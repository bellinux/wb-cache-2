This paper argues that Mises rejected the Taylor-Lange <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> proposal as irrelevant. Mises (1949) pointed to competition in financial markets as the only relevant <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> process. The <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> process in financial markets directs capital investment towards the most urgent consumer demands, and also tests the ability of entrepreneurs to speculate. Lange and Taylor overlooked the fact that Mises dismissed their <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> method {{at the outset of}} the debate, and postwar scholars of the calculation debate have underemphasized the role of financial markets in the Mises-Hayek paradigm...|$|R

50|$|Bogosort, a {{conceptual}} sorting algorithm (that is extremely inefficient and impractical), {{can be viewed}} as a <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> approach to sorting a list. However, typical simple examples of bogosort do not track which orders of the list have been tried and may try the same order any number of times, which violates one of the basic principles of <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> <b>Trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> is actually more efficient and practical than bogosort; unlike bogosort, it is guaranteed to halt in finite time on a finite list, and might even be a reasonable way to sort extremely short lists under some conditionsJumping spiders of the genus Portia use <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> to find new tactics against unfamiliar prey or in unusual situations, and remember the new tactics.

5000|$|The question, as always, {{is one of}} {{proportion}} (How much of each strategy?) and relevance (What kinds of dangers deserve the different strategies?), and ultimately, given uncertainty, of bias (When in doubt, which strategy should receive priority?). ... <b>Trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> is a device for courting small dangers {{in order to avoid}} or lessen the damage from big ones. Sequential trials by dispersed decision makers reduce the size of that unknown world to bite-sized, and hence manageable, chunks. An advantage of <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error,</b> therefore, is that it renders visible hitherto unforeseen errors. Because it is a discovery process that discloses latent errors so we can learn how to deal with them, <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> also lowers risk by reducing the scope of unforeseen dangers. <b>Trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> samples the world of as yet unknown risks; by learning to cope with risks that become evident as the result of small-scale <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error,</b> we develop skills for dealing with whatever may come our way from the world of unknown risks.|$|R

40|$|Aim: New {{competencies}} may {{be learned}} through active experience (learning by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error)</b> or observation of others’ experiences (learning by observation). Observing another person performing a complex action accelerates the observer’s {{acquisition of the}} same action and limits the time consuming process of learning by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the ability to learn by observation <b>and</b> by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> in Williams syndrome (WS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), in order to facilitate interventions that develop the acquisition of new cognitive and motor abilities in the presence of intellectual disabilities. Method: The performance of twenty-four WS individuals (mean mental age 6. 03 y ± 0. 02) and twenty-four PWS individuals (mean mental age 6. 04 y ± 0. 03) was compared with that of twenty-eight typically developing (TD) children matched for mental age and gender on tasks of learning of a visuo-motor sequence by observation or by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> The participants learned the sequence either by performing the task after in an observational training (observing an actor detecting the sequence) or by actually performing the task by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> Results: The syndromic groups showed specular learning profiles. Indeed, PWS individuals were impaired in learning the sequence by observation and they were as efficient as TD children in detecting the sequence by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> In contrast, WS individuals were able in learning the sequence by observation and they were impaired to learn the sequence by <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> in comparison to TD children. Conclusion: The present results have important implications for developing specific programs to facilitate the acquisition of new cognitive and motor competencies allowing better social integration and development of self-efficacy and self-confidence in individuals with intellectual disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Though {{there are}} {{numerous}} tuning methods available for PID controller, {{most of the time}} the controller is tuned using <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> method. The <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> based tuning of PID controller leads to deterioration in control performance. One of the solution of <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> based tuning is to either find the optimal tuning parameters using any of the tuning rule or find the optimal tuning parameters using any of the optimization algorithms. There are several evolutionary and swarm intelligence based optimization techniques available in literature. This paper finds the optimal tuning parameter using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and implements the results in a heat exchanger control problem to validate the results.

50|$|Simple {{inductive}} Turing {{machines are}} equivalent to other models of computation. More advanced inductive Turing machines {{are much more}} powerful. It is proved (Burgin, 2005) that limiting partial recursive functions, <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> predicates, general Turing machines, and simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent models of computation. However, simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines give direct constructions of computing automata, which are thoroughly grounded in physical machines. In contrast, <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> predicates, limiting recursive functions and limiting partial recursive functions present syntactic systems of symbols with formal rules for their manipulation. Simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines are related to limiting partial recursive functions <b>and</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> predicates as Turing machines are related to partial recursive functions and lambda-calculus.|$|R
