5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have differed {{in the size of the}} neural spine.|$|E
5|$|Finally, it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{the sail}} or hump {{combined}} these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, {{being used to}} cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E

5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him {{for the rest of his}} life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E

25|$|Sumerian cities {{during the}} Uruk period were {{probably}} theocratic and {{were most likely}} headed by a priest-king (ensi), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women.

25|$|Remarks: The purple apex, the {{numerous}} wavy brown flammulations that are partially {{interrupted by a}} yellow peripheral color band, and the solid shell are characteristic. This variety is similar to sultanus, but has only partial interruption of the stripes by the color band and has the purple apex.

25|$|Alford {{takes as}} his {{starting}} point {{the golden rule}} that the pharaoh had {{to be buried in}} the earth, i.e. at ground level or below, and this leads him to conclude that Khufu was interred in an ingeniously concealed cave whose entrance is today sealed up in the so-called Well Shaft adjacent to a known cave called the Grotto.

25|$|The word wicket is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.|$|E

2500|$|Academic George Sieg {{expressed}} doubts regarding Myatt being Long, {{writing that}} he considered it to be [...] "implausible and untenable based {{on the extent of}} variance in writing style, personality, and tone" [...] between Myatt and Long's writings.

25|$|Between 1768 and 1769, French traders from Mauritius in Fort Dauphin sold 10,000 guns, 50 tons of gunpowder, 120,000 {{lead shot}} bullets, 300,000 gunflints, 24,000 knives and 10,000 small mirrors. They {{were most likely}} {{purchased}} through bartering both India Rubber and slaves. At {{this point in time}} a slave could be purchased in some parts of Madagascar for 2–3 muskets. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> at least some of these guns were traded by Antanosy with the Tandroy for cattle which the Antanosy then traded with Europeans. Arms retained by the Antanosy were later used in their unsuccessful defense of Anosy from the Imerina army which came south in the early 1800s.|$|E
25|$|NELL2 is a tissue-specific {{protein in}} the nervous system. It {{contains}} EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeat domain and its gene expression is regulated by estrogen. NELL2 {{is also known}} to play a neuroprotective role rat hippocampus neurons. When NELL2 synthesis is blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of antisense (AS) NELL2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into neonatal male rat brains (postnatal day0-day5), the size of SDN-POA is decreased. Since volume of SDN {{is related to the}} level of testosterone, it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the volume is finally due to the neuroprotective effect of estradiol which is produced from testosterone by aromatase. So the result that NELL2 blockage reduces the size of SDN-POA suggests that it probably has neuroprotective effect on SDN-POA.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland the {{commencement}} of the Iron Age around 600 BC is generally believed {{to coincide with the}} first appearance in this country of Celtic-speaking peoples. There is little archaeological evidence to support the theory of a large-scale Celtic invasion (or series of invasions), but it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> small groups of migrants, highly skilled in the art of war and armed with superior iron weaponry, were powerful enough to gain a foothold in the island and eventually succeeded in subjugating or absorbing the pre-Celtic natives; in the 12th century of the Common Era small bands of heavily armed Anglo-Normans did just this, so there is no conceivable reason why it could not also have happened in the pre-Christian era.|$|E
