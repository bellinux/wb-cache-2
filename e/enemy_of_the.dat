5|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a {{military}} expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tipu Sultan, a Muslim <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British in India.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E
5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Hungary {{at the beginning}} of 1290. On this occasion, Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom, also urged him to come, since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated LadislausIV with the assistance of Ivan Kőszegi. Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, an <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him. Hahót sent Andrew to Vienna, where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognized Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they stood by and followed the relations between Finland and Germany, the main <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allies, which hoped to override Lenin's regime and get Russia back into the war against the Germans. As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened it, in order to get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The <b>Enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, German anti-Semitic theorist Alfred Rosenberg in {{his primary}} {{contribution}} to Nazi theory on Zionism, Der Staatsfeindliche Zionismus ("Zionism, the <b>Enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State"), accused German Zionists {{of working for}} a German defeat and supporting Britain and {{the implementation of the}} Balfour Declaration, in a version of the stab-in-the-back myth. Adolf Hitler took a similar approach in some of his speeches from 1920 onwards.|$|E

5|$|In 2503, Mohandar {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Hierarchy to discuss Zamara, a missing preserver. There were none on Shakuras. A terran female, Rosemary Dahl, attended the meeting, along with Vartanil (a survivor from Aiur) and Executor Selendis; she was subject to protoss anti-female bias (due to their experiences with Sarah Kerrigan). Among the topics of conversation covered were Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon and old <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Khalai. During the meeting, Mohandar deferred to the judgment of Hierarch Artanis.|$|E

5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. The revelation that Allen {{would be an}} <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News were impressed with Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted {{to see more of}} that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, Charles IV of Luxembourg {{was elected}} emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In {{consequence}} of an alliance between {{his father and}} Pope Clement VI, the relentless <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor Louis IV, Charles was chosen Roman king in opposition to Louis {{by some of the}} princes at Rhens. He had previously promised to be subservient to Clement, he confirmed the papacy in the possession of wide territories, promised to annul the acts of Louis against Clement, to take no part in Italian affairs, and to defend and protect the church.|$|E
