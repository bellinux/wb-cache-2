25|$|Paul Edmond <b>Flato</b> {{was born}} in 1900 in Shiner, Texas, son of {{prominent}} Texas cattleman Rudolph, and Julia Burow <b>Flato,</b> a German immigrant. He died on July 17, 1999 having returned to Texas late in life, and received full column obituary in the New York Times. He {{was said to have}} become interested in jewelry at the age of ten, watching nomadic Gypsies make silver-wire items for sale. He grew up in a town founded by his westward pioneering great-grandparents, earlier German immigrants who purchased Mexican land. After attending the University of Texas at Austin, he moved to New York City in the early 1920s to start medical school. But due to his father's financial issues at the time, he instead became a watch salesman.|$|E
5000|$|He {{resigned}} {{from the government and}} moved to San Francisco about mid-July 1945. He is mentioned in Venona project transcript #588 of April 29, 1944. <b>Flato's</b> complicity in espionage was corroborated by information exhumed from the NKVD archives in the 1990s. He was {{also a member of the}} [...] "Sound" [...] and [...] "Myrna" [...] groups. His codename in the Gorsky memo is [...] "Bob".

Considered the first celebrity jeweler, he was well known for {{important}} jewelry, and as an early proponent of whimsical pieces. His long list of movie star clients included Greta Garbo, Mae West, Rita Hayworth, Joan Crawford, Doris Duke, Ginger Rogers, Carmen Miranda, Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn, and Gloria Vanderbilt—many of whom wore his pieces on screen.|$|E

2500|$|While {{in federal}} custody in the US, Browder never {{revealed}} {{his status as}} an agent recruiter. He was never prosecuted for espionage. Venona decrypt #588 April 29, 1944, from the KGB New York office states, [...] "for {{more than a year}} Zubilin (station chief) and I tried {{to get in touch with}} Victor Perlo and Charles <b>Flato.</b> For some reason Browder did not come to the meeting and just decided to put Bentley in touch with the whole group. All occupy responsible positions in Washington, D.C." [...] Soviet intelligence thought highly of Browder's recruitment work: in a 1946 OGPU memorandum, Browder was personally credited with hiring eighteen intelligence agents for the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brothers}} each studied {{applied mathematics}} in Paris, but then began careers in television, hosting several popular programs {{on science and}} science fiction. [...] The first of these, Temps X (Time X), ran from 1979 to 1989. In 1991 the Bogdanovs published a book, Dieu et la Science (God and Science), drawn from interviews with the philosopher Jean Guitton. [...] It became a French bestseller. This book provoked a dispute of its own when University of Virginia astronomy professor Trinh Xuan Thuan accused the Bogdanovs of plagiarizing his 1988 book The Secret Melody: And Man Created the Universe. [...] After a legal battle in France, Thuan and the Bogdanovs settled out of court, and the Bogdanovs later denied all wrongdoing. Thuan suggests that the plagiarism suit pressed the brothers to obtain doctorates as fast as possible, since (according to Thuan) the back cover of the book claimed that the Bogdanovs held doctorates when they did not. In 1993, the brothers began work toward doctorates, first working under the mathematical physicist Moshé <b>Flato</b> of the University of Burgundy. <b>Flato</b> died in 1998, and his colleague Daniel Sternheimer (of CNRS) took over the job of supervising the Bogdanovs. According to Sternheimer, the twins viewed themselves as [...] "the Einstein brothers" [...] and had a propensity to voice vague, [...] "impressionistic" [...] statements; he considered guiding their efforts [...] "like teaching My Fair Lady to speak with an Oxford accent." [...] As he told The Chronicle of Higher Education, Sternheimer did not consider himself an expert in all the topics Grichka Bogdanov included in his thesis, but judged that those portions within his specialty were Ph.D.-quality work.|$|E
