2500|$|The prayer [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{has some}} difficulties. The Greek version adds a rubric before it: [...] "Here he names the dead". What can the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{have to do}} with the dead? The Antiochene Liturgy, in which several {{parallel}} passages to the modern Canon have already been noticed, has a parallel to the second half of this prayer too, and that parallel occurs in its commemoration of the dead. There, following a prayer that the dead may rest [...] "in the land of the living, in thy kingdom [...] [...] [...] in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", etc., is found this continuation: [...] "And keep for us in peace, O Lord, a Christian, well-pleasing and sinless end to our lives, gathering us under the feet of thy Elect, when Thou willest and as Thou willest, only without shame and offence; through thy only begotten Son our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ." [...] We notice here the reference to the elect (in electorum tuorum <b>grege),</b> the prayer that we may be kept [...] "in peace" [...] (in tuâ pace disponas), the allusion to the [...] "end of our lives" [...] (diesque nostros) and the unusual [...] "Per Christum Dominum nostrum", making a break in the middle of the Eucharistic prayer. The Syrian form with its plain reference to death ("the end of our lives") seems more clearly to be a continuation of a prayer for the faithful departed. But in the Roman form too is found such a reference in the words about hell (ab æterna damnatione) and heaven (in electorum tuorum <b>grege).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Drews then {{proposes to}} divide the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] into two {{separate}} parts. The second half, beginning at the words [...] "diesque nostros", would have originally {{been the end of}} the Commemoration of the Dead and would form a reduplication of the [...] "Nobis quoque peccatoribus", where the same idea occurs ("partem aliquam et societatem donare digneris cum tuis sanctis Apostolis er Martyribus" [...] being an echo of [...] "in electorum tuorum iubeas <b>grege</b> numerari"). This second half, then, would belong to the Intercession after the Consecration, and would originally fall together with the [...] "Nobis quoque". In any case, even in the present arrangement of the Canon the [...] "Nobis quoque" [...] following the [...] "Commemoratio pro defunctis" [...] shows that at Rome as in other liturgies the idea of adding a prayer for ourselves, that we too may find a peaceful and blessed death followed by a share in the company of the saints, after our prayer for the faithful departed was accepted as natural.|$|E

60|$|Now {{there came}} to her one day at luncheon time,--on the day {{succeeding}} that on which Miss French had promised to sacrifice her chignon,--a certain Mrs. Clifford from Budleigh Salterton, to whom she was much attached. Perhaps the distance of Budleigh Salterton from Exeter added somewhat to this affection, so that Mrs. Clifford was almost closer to our friend's heart even than Mrs. MacHugh, who lived just {{at the other end}} of the cathedral. And in truth Mrs. Clifford was a woman more serious in her mode of thought than Mrs. MacHugh, and one who had more in common with Miss Stanbury than that other lady. Mrs. Clifford had been a Miss Noel of Doddiscombe Leigh, and she and Miss Stanbury had been engaged to be married at the same time,--each to a man of fortune. One match had been completed in the ordinary course of matches. What had been the course of the other we already know. But the friendship had been maintained on very close terms. Mrs. MacHugh was a Gallio at heart, anxious chiefly to remove from herself,--and from her friends also,--all the troubles of life, and make things smooth and easy. She was one who disregarded great questions; who cared little or nothing what people said of her; who considered nothing worth the trouble of a fight;--Epicuri de <b>grege</b> porca. But there was nothing swinish about Mrs. Clifford of Budleigh Salterton. She took life thoroughly in earnest. She was a Tory who sorrowed heartily for her country, believing that it was being brought to ruin by the counsels of evil men. She prayed daily to be delivered from dissenters, radicals, and wolves in sheep's clothing,--by which latter bad name she meant especially a certain leading politician of the day who had, with the cunning of the devil, tempted and perverted the virtue of her own political friends. And she was one who thought that the slightest breath of scandal on a young woman's name should be stopped at once. An antique, pure-minded, anxious, self-sacrificing matron was Mrs. Clifford, and very dear to the heart of Miss Stanbury.|$|E

Language is a tool to communicate wherever we are, we should be able to put language in place. When we communicate we must control every word that we say that the language does not make people confused especially when we are in the school environment. Many people who think language is the easy thing, but when we learn more about the language we will find several factors why some people can only be silent when we asked. Although silence is much sense, especially in the school, when the teacher gives his students a question, they just keep quiet especially in learning English. They could only smile and smile therefore before we communicate with them should we need to know, master and memorize vocabulary words that we commonly use to talk in their daily lives.
