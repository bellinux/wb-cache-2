50|$|In the mid 20th century, {{there was}} {{innovation}} in production and sales. Mechanical <b>kneaders</b> and mixers were introduced {{at the beginning}} of this century. Up through 1940s, most bakeries displayed and sold their products in glass cases, requiring customers to ask counter workers to put together their order. In the 1950s, baker Antonio Ordóñez Ríos decided to do away with the glass in the cases and allow customers to choose their own breads and place them on a tray to be counted and charged by staff. This is the system used in most bakeries in Mexico today.|$|E
40|$|Modification of {{rheological}} properties of wheat flour dough by addition of different additives (amino acids, e. g. L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, inactivated dry yeast, L-tyrosine) {{was investigated in}} this study. The dough was mixed {{with the use of}} knife and spiral <b>kneaders.</b> It was observed that different technology of mixing and the addition of individual amino acids influence rheology of the prepared dough in different way. Results obtained by oscillation rheometry showed the influence of different additives on the dough rheology. Significant softening of the dough with addition of L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate was observed. The effect of inactivated dry yeast and L-tyrosine on dough rheology was much weaker. Knowledge of theological properties is very important because it enables standardization of flour mixture preparation and development of wheat dough with required properties...|$|E

The main process parameters were measured including: rotational speed of screw, pulp consistency of entrance and exit, pressure and temperature of pulp. The {{results showed that the}} main action of high-shear fiber <b>kneader</b> on fibers was promoted the relative displacement of exterior and interior fibers, rather than the cutting fibers. After the treatment by the high-shear fiber <b>kneader</b> under high consistency pulp, the shives could be reduced by 95 %. The fiber morphology was obviously different from the control samples.

40|$|AbstractIn {{traditional}} dough kneading machines the ingredients, e. g. flour, water, {{salt and}} yeast are filled into a cylindrical vessel and mixed {{by means of}} a rotating spiral. In order to assure consistent dough quality while environmental conditions and flour characteristics vary, an experienced baker needs to 1) manually set the rotational speed as well as the time for kneading and 2) continuously monitor the kneading process. The overall goal of this work is to develop an intelligent kneading machine that autonomously decides how to set the speed and when to stop kneading. This machine assists the bakers work and allows for more efficient use of <b>kneaders</b> as part of autonomous production systems. We describe the design of intelligent information processing algorithms that were implemented in a technology demonstrator and validated with the expertise of professional bakers. While focusing on the control software, the underlying concepts are explained and relevant results are shown. In particular, reliable detection of phase-shifts and model-based prediction of dough properties was achieved...|$|E

40|$|Simple {{blending}} {{and dynamic}} vulcanisation of EPDM/PE blends using the resol/SnCl 2 system was studied in an extruder using {{a series of}} sampling devices. The melting of the PE pellets occurs {{just in front of}} and in the first kneading zone. Upon complete melting of the PE phase, the EPDM/PE blends reach very quickly their final morphology. Crosslinking of the EPDM phase to high levels occurs already when the PE phase is not yet fully molten. The higher the EPDM content, the higher the viscous dissipation, the higher the melt temperature and, consequently, the higher the crosslinking rate. For the EPDM/PE (50 / 50; w/w) TPV a transition from continuous via co-continuous to fully dispersed EPDMis observed, which is driven by crosslinking. Although the degree of crosslinking of the EPDMrubber is very high, this does not prevent phase inversion of the blend. The EPDM/PE interface is rather blurred, because PE crystalline lamellae are growing into the EPDM domains, probably because of the high compatibility between PE and EPDM (60 wt% of ethene). This study shows that dynamic vulcanisation in extruders proceeds quite differently from that in batch <b>kneaders,</b> where melting, mixing and crosslinking are separated in time. In extruders mass and heat transport, melting of the thermoplastic, morphology development (including dispersion and phase inversion), distribution and dissolution of (crosslinking) chemicals and crosslinking of the rubber do not occur as independent phenomena, but mutually and/or continuously interact...|$|E

40|$|Extrusion {{processes}} and especially processes of PVC extrusion {{are based on}} the supply of mechanical energy. The use of mechanical energy results in a great wear of the production plant and material load. In this report, the development of microwave assisted extrusion processes is described. This development is based on polyvinylchloride and is proceeded at the Fraunhofer Institute of Chemical Technology (Pfinztal, Federal Republic of Germany). The advantages of the use of microwaves are: independence of thermal conduction, fastly controllable energization, improvement of the ecology and economy of processes. By means of microwave calorimetry, different PVC powders are characterized rapidly and exactly. Different mixtures of PVC powders with additives are investigated with regard to their heating up by means of microwaves at a frequency of 2. 5 GHz. Great differences in the group of lubricants and in the systems of stabilisators are manifested. Dry fillers absorb very small amounts of water. The composition of the mixtures do not influence the adsorption behavior of the mixtures. The use of microwave technique in order to heat up unpolar plastics requires highly microwave active additives. The authors have discovered additives and base chemicals which can be used for the activation of unpolar plastics by microwave absorption. A microwave assisted plastification of PVC in a laboratory is achieved for the first time by means of a microwave assisted measuring <b>kneader.</b> By modification of the <b>kneader</b> chamber of the measuring <b>kneader,</b> one part of the energy which is used for the plastification is supplied by microwaves. The efficiency of the microwaves is greater than 90 %. The microwave coupling shows a very good stability of high-frequency tuning against external influences by interference.
