25|$|The initial near-complete MPEG-1 {{standard}} (parts 1, 2 and 3) was {{publicly available}} on 6 December 1991 as ISO CD 11172. In most countries, patents cannot be filed after prior art {{has been made}} public, and patents expire 20 years after the initial <b>filing</b> <b>date,</b> which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries.

25|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{international}} treaty procedures, {{such as the}} procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) , that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, {{the principles of the}} convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original <b>filing</b> <b>date.</b> Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.|$|E

40|$|Creating a <b>file</b> <b>date</b> {{for each}} input file, when {{one does not}} exist in the file, becomes a tedious task as the number of files grows. Different methods can be used, such as reading in all the files at once, using a file counter, the Job File Control Block (JFCB), and {{implementing}} macros. The key was to find a solution that reduces both the programmer’s time and CPU time. When all methods were compared to reading in each file in its own data step, the file counter and JFCB both increased CPU time, but decreased the amount of hard coding necessary, while using a macro decreased the amount of hard coding and CPU time. This made the macro the most efficient solution when looking at both the programmer’s time and CPU time. This method can be used if the <b>file</b> <b>date</b> is anywhere in the filename. When the need arises to do analysis based on the <b>file</b> <b>date</b> of the <b>file,</b> it can be time consuming to hard code the <b>file</b> <b>date</b> in for each file. This is especially true when the analysis is needed covering multiple years on a file that is submitted every month. There are different techniques available to accomplish this task without having to hard code the <b>file</b> <b>date.</b> One of the techniques, the Job File Control Block, is specific to working on the mainframe.

2500|$|A patent {{does not}} give a right to make or use or sell an invention. Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, {{offering}} for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the <b>filing</b> <b>date</b> subject to the payment of maintenance fees. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor [...] "a right to try to exclude by asserting the patent in court", for many granted patents {{turn out to be}} invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court. A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.|$|E
50|$|To {{obtain a}} <b>filing</b> <b>date,</b> the {{documents}} filed {{must comply with}} the regulations of the patent office {{in which it was}} filed.

However, since no subject matter can be added to an application after the <b>filing</b> <b>date,</b> it is important that an application disclose all material relevant to the application at the time of filing. If the requirements for the award of a <b>filing</b> <b>date</b> are not met, the patent office notifies the applicant of the deficiencies. Depending upon the law of the patent office in question, correction may be possible without moving the <b>filing</b> <b>date,</b> or the application may be awarded a <b>filing</b> <b>date</b> adjusted to the date on which the requirements are completed.|$|E
