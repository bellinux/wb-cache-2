5|$|Although {{the results}} of Noether's first epoch were {{impressive}} and useful, her fame as a mathematician rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third <b>epochs,</b> as noted by Hermann Weyl and B. L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.|$|E
5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} Eocene to Oligocene <b>epochs,</b> first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance. (They are now {{thought to be}} related to hippopotamus and pigs). Three models were made, forming a small herd.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil is {{also known}} for his history of the {{universe}} in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical <b>epoch,</b> (2) the life <b>epoch,</b> (3) the human/brain <b>epoch,</b> (4) the technology <b>epoch,</b> (5) the artificial intelligence <b>epoch,</b> and (6) the universal colonization <b>epoch.</b> Going from one <b>epoch</b> to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each <b>epoch</b> takes a shorter time, which means the whole {{history of the universe}} is one giant Singularity event.|$|R
50|$|The Unix time {{number is}} zero at the Unix <b>epoch,</b> and {{increases}} by exactly 86,400 per day since the <b>epoch.</b> Thus 2004-09-16T00:00:00Z, 12,677 {{days after the}} <b>epoch,</b> {{is represented by the}} Unix time number 12,677 × 86,400 = 1095292800. This can be extended backwards from the <b>epoch</b> too, using negative numbers; thus 1957-10-04T00:00:00Z, 4,472 days before the <b>epoch,</b> is represented by the Unix time number −4,472 × 86,400 = −386380800.|$|R

5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene <b>epochs.</b> These <b>epochs</b> had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E
5|$|In the Miocene and Pliocene <b>epochs</b> further uplift {{and erosion}} {{occurred}} in the Highlands. Plant and animal types developed into their modern forms. Scotland lay in its present position on the globe. As the Miocene progressed, temperatures dropped and remained similar to today's.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{not known}} in the fossil record on Madagascar until the Pleistocene and Holocene <b>epochs.</b> Consequently, {{little is known about}} the {{evolution}} of ruffed lemurs, let alone the entire lemur clade, which comprises the endemic primate population of the island.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>epoch</b> CÐ &minus;43.2683 was 10(&minus;43.2683) seconds, which {{represents}} the Planck time since the big bang (Time Zero).

5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton <b>epochs.</b> Together, these <b>epochs</b> encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They {{were built in the}} Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing <b>epochs</b> of construction.|$|E
5|$|In his 1778 work <b>Epochs</b> of Nature Georges Buffon {{referred}} to fossils, {{in particular the}} discovery of fossils of tropical species such as elephants and rhinoceros in northern Europe, as evidence for {{the theory that the}} earth had started out much warmer than it currently was and had been gradually cooling.|$|E

60|$|For the rest, {{it was an}} <b>epoch</b> of {{reaction}} from the Age of Chivalry: an <b>epoch</b> of unbounded luxury, of the cult and worship of the beautiful externally; an <b>epoch</b> that set no store by any inward virtue, by truth or honour; an <b>epoch</b> that laid it down as a maxim that no inconvenient engagement should be kept if opportunity offered to evade it.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we study a special type of task {{scheduling}} {{referred to as}} <b>epoch</b> scheduling in a distributed server (processor) system. With this policy, processor queues are rearranged {{only at the end}} of predefined intervals. The time interval between successive queue rearrangements is called an <b>epoch.</b> The objective is to examine if <b>epoch</b> scheduling can perform close to STF method and achieve fairer service than that of STF. A simulation model is used to address performance issues associated with <b>epoch</b> scheduling. Simulated results indicate that <b>epoch</b> scheduling is a good method to use...|$|R
5|$|Lapworth {{also had}} a {{prominent}} {{role to play in}} the fame of Dob's Linn, a small gorge in the Scottish Borders, which contains the 'golden spike' (i.e. the official international boundary or stratotype) between the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Lapworth's work in this area, especially his examination of the complex stratigraphy of the Silurian rocks by comparing fossil graptolites, was crucial in to the early understanding of these <b>epochs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Histoire Naturelle, {{which was}} meant to address the whole of natural history, {{actually}} covers only minerals, birds, and the quadrupeds among animals. It is accompanied by some discourses and a theory of the earth by way of introduction, and by supplements including an elegantly written account of the <b>epochs</b> of nature.|$|E
5|$|The fault, {{which is}} aligned eastwest, is {{connected}} to the northsouth trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed monoclines, anticlines, and synclines, all of which suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era, when strike-slip faulting took place nearby. The fault runs along an ancient Precambrian terrane boundary. It was active mainly in the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian <b>epochs</b> around 300 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|There is an <b>epoch</b> {{for each}} {{version of the}} Chinese calendar, which is called Lìyuán (...)

[...] And tracing back to a perfect day, such as that day with the magical star sign, there's a supreme <b>epoch</b> (...) [...] The continuous year based on the supreme <b>epoch</b> is shàngyuán jīnián (...) [...] More and more factors were added into the supreme <b>epoch,</b> and the shàngyuán jīnián became a huge number. So, the supreme <b>epoch</b> and shàngyuán jīnián were neglected from the Shòushí calendar.|$|R

5|$|The giant ground sloth Megatherium is {{from the}} Pliocene to Pleistocene <b>epochs</b> in South America, where Charles Darwin had {{excavated}} some fossils in 1835. The model was built hugging a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model's arm. The arm was replaced and later the tree died. This model {{used to be in}} the children's zoo which has now been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene <b>epochs.</b> In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|In these <b>epochs,</b> she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E
50|$|Philip {{disagrees with}} the {{majority}} view that the Pleistocene <b>epoch</b> has ended.

5|$|James Croll (1821–90) {{developed}} {{a theory of}} climate change based on changes in the Earth's orbit. Born near Perth, he was self-educated and his interest in science led to his becoming appointed as a janitor in the museum at the Andersonian College and Museum, Glasgow in 1859. His 1864 paper On the Physical Cause of the Changes of Climate during Glacial <b>Epochs</b> led to {{a position in the}} Edinburgh office of the Geological Survey of Scotland, as keeper of maps and correspondence, where Sir Archibald Geikie, encouraged his research. He was eventually to become a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical <b>epochs.</b> It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E
5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene <b>epochs</b> in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{as they were in}} a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold: first to {{document}} the gender differences in Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) according to two <b>epoch</b> systems (5 vs. 60 s) in preschoolers, and, second to document the differences in physical activity (PA) patterns according to two different <b>epoch</b> choices. The sample comprised 59 preschoolers (31 girls) aged 2 - 5 years old. PA was assessed by accelerometer during school hours. The time spent in MVPA was significantly higher (p <. 001) when a 5 -s <b>epoch</b> was considered compared to the 60 -s <b>epoch,</b> regardless gender. Further, it was found a difference of ? 17 min difference between the 2 <b>epoch</b> systems for MVPA.
