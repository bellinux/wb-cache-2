40|$|Element {{concentrations}} in selected fish species from different trophic levels were analyzed. The following fish species were analyzed: common nase (Chondrostoma nasus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), <b>freshwater</b> <b>bream</b> (Abramis brama), barbel (Barbus barbus), Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio),chub (Squalius cephalus), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and northern pike (Esox lucius). Fish {{were collected from}} the Međuvršje Reservoir (West Morava River Basin, western Serbia) during 2012, and samples of liver, muscle and gills were analyzed for As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The liver and gills had the highest measured element concentrations, with Cu, Zn, Fe and Sr being the most prominent. The bioaccumulation of metals was species-specific, with the accumulation exhibiting the following trends: Prussian carp > northern pike > <b>freshwater</b> <b>bream</b> > European perch > chub > common nase > barbell > roach > wels catfish; Li>Pb>Zn>Cu>Fe>Ba>Mn>Sr>Cr>As>Mo>Ni>B, in all examined species; for Co, Cd and Hg, the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was 0. Results of this study point to the tissue-specific differences in element concentrations, and to distinct differences between fish species regarding the accumulation patterns: common nase, with the highest accumulation observed in the liver, and Prussian carp, with the highest accumulation observed in the gills.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} several Australian Aboriginal myths (or sacred histories) {{from the}} Georgina River Basin region of Central Australia that concern the Triodia grasses {{known locally as}} spinifex (or aywerte). The sacred song lines of this Dreaming connect or relate to the Red Kangaroo, Wild Bee, <b>Freshwater</b> <b>Bream,</b> and Black-Headed Python totems joining distant groups in the arid interior of Australia. These sacred histories provide an epistemological foundation to the regional intellectual property over traditional spinifex technologies utilized for architectural, material and medicinal functions. The paper explores the contemporary re-vitalization of this knowledge in collaborative research partnership between a group of traditional tribal owners (the Indjilandji, Wakaya and Bularnu peoples) {{and a team of}} scientific researchers from the University of Queensland (including the author) ...|$|R

40|$|Biomonitoring {{from water}} of the River Danube and Srebarna Lake was {{performed}} using freshwater fish and their parasites and parasite communities as bioindicators. During 2013, 78 specimens of <b>freshwater</b> <b>bream</b> (Abramis brama (L., 1758) were examined with standard techniques for parasites. Three species of parasites (Gyrodactylus elegans Nordmann, 1832, Diplozoon paradoxum Nordmann, 1832 and Pomphorhynchus tereticollis (Rudilphi, 1809)) were fixed. The analysis of the dominant structure of the found taxa {{was presented to the}} level of the component communities. New parasite and host records were determined. All fixed parasite species are core for the parasite communities of examined fish. Concentration of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu) in fish (muscle, liver, intestine and bones), endohelminth species Pomphorhynchus tereticollis as bioindicators and bottom sediments were analyzed. Bioindicator significance of parasite species was studied. For an ecological evaluation of the situation of the analyzed freshwater ecosystems, principal biotic indices were fixed...|$|R

30|$|Silver perch, Bidyanus bidyanus (Mitchell, 1838), {{endemic to}} the Murray-Darling river system in New South Wales, {{is a native}} Australian {{freshwater}} fish, belonging to the Teraponidae family (Merrick and Schmida 1984). Also known as <b>freshwater</b> <b>bream,</b> silver bream and grunter, the silver perch occupies the northern and western rivers and {{upper reaches of the}} Murray-Darling river system (Rowland 1995). It is an important freshwater aquaculture species intensively cultured in Australia with production around 500 metric tons per year (Rowland 2009). It has also been cultured in China, Taiwan and Israel (Allan and Rowland 2002). Limited information on its morphogenesis and larval ontogeny originating from wild broodfish has been reported by Lake (1967 b), but no detailed information has been published about domesticated broodfish. Since the life cycle of the silver perch can be closed in captivity (Rowland 2004), it is important to assess the ontogeny and morphogenesis of larvae from the domesticated broodfish and compare it with the larvae from the wild broodfish.|$|R
40|$|The Danube River in the {{vicinity}} of the city of Belgrade receives large amounts of untreated or poorly treated communal and industrial waste waters. The aim of this study was to assess elemental accumulation patterns in a number of economically important fish species in this area that belong to different trophic levels. Concentrations of 17 elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr and Zn) were assessed in liver, muscle, gills and gonads of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), <b>freshwater</b> <b>bream</b> (Abramis brama), white bream (Blicca bjoerkna), common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and wels catfish (Silurus glanis) from the Danube River in Serbia by the use of ICP-OES. Silver carp specimens were differentiated from the other four species by high concentrations of Al and Fe in the liver. Common carp specimens were differentiated by high concentrations of Zn in gills, muscle and liver. Distribution of elements among different tissues had a consistent pattern among the species. Concentrations of Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu and Fe in muscle were at acceptable levels for human consumption, while concentrations of Fe and Zn were above maximum acceptable concentrations in liver and gonads...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The study {{examined}} the concentration of total mercury and correlation coefficients between fish size or FCF (condition factor) {{and the content of}} Hg in muscle tissue of six <b>freshwater</b> fish: <b>bream</b> (Abramis brama L.), roach (Rutilus rutilus L.), whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.), vendace (Coregonus albula L.), perch (Perca fluviatilis L.), and pike (Esox lucius L.). Material and Methods: The fish were caught from the Lake Pluszne located in the Olsztyn Lake District (Poland). Mercury was analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry using Milestone DMA- 80 (with dual-cell). Results: The content of the element in the muscles of the examined fish was as follows: pike (0. 197 mg/kg) ≈ perch (0. 173 mg/kg) > vendace (0. 114 mg/kg) ≈ roach (0. 095 mg/kg) and roach ≈ whitefish (0. 065 mg/kg), and whitefish ≈ bream (0. 042 mg/kg) (p ≤ 0. 05). In all cases, the content of mercury correlated positively with the body weight and total length of the fish. Only the correlation coefficients between mercury concentration and weight or length of bream were slightly higher (0. 979 and 0. 977 respectively, p ≤ 0. 001). The length and weight relationship of the fish was also determined. Conclusion: The results showed that the levels of mercury were lower than the maximum acceptable limit established by the Commission Regulation (EC) No 629 / 2008 of 2 July 2008. Thus, they are safe from consumer health point of view...|$|R
5000|$|Gonarezhou National Park, {{encompassing}} an area {{of about}} 5000 km2, in southeastern Zimbabwe is in a remote region along the Mozambique border and is the second largest such park in the country; the first largest park is the Hwange National Park. ‘Gonarezhou’ in Shona means [...] "elephant's tusk" [...] (which the herbalists used to store their medicines) and it also means [...] "place of many elephants." [...] The park’s habitat consists of baobabs, scrub lands and sandstone cliffs in the lowveld region. The park is very large, in rugged terrain, and hence remains unaffected by human interference. The park is within the ambit of the transboundary part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Gonarezhou with the Kruger National Park in South Africa and the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique. Animals move freely between the three sanctuaries. The park's rich wild life consists of 500 species of birds, 147 species of mammals, more than 116 species of reptiles, 34 species of frogs and 49 species of fish. The park's rivers and pools have some unique species of aqua fauna such as the Zambezi shark, <b>freshwater</b> goby, black <b>bream</b> and the turquoise killifish.|$|R
