40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of operating parameters such as liquid flow rate, <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> and capillary diameter as well as the influence of the physical properties of the liquid, in particular viscosity, on the generation of monodisperse microbubbles in a circular cross section T-junction device. Aqueous glycerol solutions with viscosities ranging from 1 - to 100 mPa s were used in the experiments. The bubble diameter generated was studied for systematically varied combinations of <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> liquid flow rate, and liquid viscosity with a fixed capillary inner diameter of 150 μm for the liquid and gas inlet channels as well as the outlet channel. In addition, the effect of channel geometry on bubble size was studied using capillaries with inner diameters of first 100 and then 200 μm. In all the experiments the distance between the coaxial capillaries at the junction was set to be 200 μm. All the microbubbles produced in this study were highly monodisperse (polydispersity index < 1 %) and it was found, as expected, that bubble formation and size were influenced by the ratio of liquid to gas flow rate, capillary size, and liquid viscosity. The experimental data were then compared with empirical scaling laws derived for rectangular cross-section junctions. In contrast with these previous studies, which have found bubble size to be dependent on either the flow rate ratio (the squeezing regime) or capillary number (the dripping regime), in this experimental study bubble size was found to depend on both capillary number and flow ratio. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

Air and water superficial velocities were 0. 018 - 0. 791 m/s and 0. 042 - 0. 757 m/s, respectively. Three-dimensional modeling was performed with {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) software FLUENT and the volume of fluid (VOF) model. Slug flow (snapping/breaking/jetting) and stratified flow were observed experimentally. Numerically predicted void fraction followed a linear relationship with the homogeneous void fraction, while experimental values depended on the superficial velocity ratio U-C/U-L. Higher experimental velocity slip caused by <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> build-up and oscillation caused deviation from numerical predictions.

We compared the well-known Y-jet atomizer with the less known, “outside in liquid” (OIL), configuration of the effervescent atomizer. The required liquid viscosity was achieved by using the water-maltodextrin solutions of different concentrations.

40|$|A {{high speed}} digital {{analysis}} technique {{has been used}} to study the atomisation plume of a superheated sample of Ni–Al in a close coupled gas atomiser. The atomisation, incorporating a generic melt nozzle and die design was captured using a Kodak high speed digital analyser at a frame rate of 18 k frames per second. The resulting 65 536 frames were then analysed using a specially designed routine, which calculates values of optical brightness and position of the intensity maximum for all frames and performs Fourier analysis on the sequence. The data produced from this analysis show that the plume, pulses at low frequencies (< 25 Hz) and precesses at higher frequencies (∼ 360 Hz) around the atomiser's centreline. To aid investigation into the origins of this precession and other phenomena it was decided to conduct further experiments using an analogue system.

40|$|PEMFC due {{to their}} high energy density, low {{operating}} temperature and high efficiency {{are considered to be}} very suitable for vehicle propulsion. In such applications, fuel cells could encounter operating conditions which are severe to the materials involved. Fuel cell testing shall as close as possible reflect conditions encountered in real life. To enable a fair comparative assessment of the performance of MEA under operating conditions foreseen in future automotive applications, a set of representative operating conditions in addition with a test methodology is proposed. The aim of a unified set of harmonised operating conditions is to comparatively test and evaluate the performance of different MEAs in single cells. The current document {{is the result of a}} cumulative effort of industry and research organisations participating in FCH-JU funded projects for automotive applications, in establishing a harmonised test protocol for assessing PEMFC performance and durability at a single cell level. This document presents a set of reference operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, humidification, gas flow and composition at the fuel and oxidant inlet representative for future automotive applications. It also defines boundaries of these conditions within which the cell is expected to operate. While not specifying single cell design details, cell operation in counter flow is mandatory for comparative assessment. A methodology is established to examining the relative influence that the individual operating parameters exert on the MEA performance in single cell configuration once the cell is subjected to the more challenging boundary conditions defined in this document which are also called as stressor conditions. In addition to operating conditions, the most likely stressor conditions for single cell testing could be identified as follows: Load cycling, Mechanical effects, Fuel Air contaminants (impurities), and Environmental Conditions. In this document the focus is on stressors related to Operating Conditions and Load Cycling. Deviations from the automotive reference Operating Conditions may result in changes to both cell performance and durability. In principle the influence of each stressor on cell performance could be studied individually. However, since a number of stressors are inter-linked, (changing the value of one stressor could inevitably change the value of another), the stressor tests have been grouped into four families of Stressors, namely: Cell Temperature Stressor Tests, Reactants Gas Inlet Humidification Stressor Tests, Reactants <b>Gas</b> <b>Inlet</b> <b>Pressure</b> Stressor Tests, Oxidant Stoichiometry Stressor Tests. The aim of these tests is to study the effect of each stressor on the the cell voltage at three different current densities representative of activation, ohmic polarization and mass transfer regimes as a function of each stressor condition. The successful operation of a fuel cell depends not only on its performance but also on its durability. Fuel cell durability is evaluated through endurance testing by applying a repetitive load profile to the cell and measuring performance degradation in terms of cell voltage decrease as function of operating hours. To assess the cell degradation rate a dynamic load cycle for endurance testing is proposed. The Fuel Cell Dynamic Load Cycle is used in this document and is derived from the New European Driving Cycle modified for fuel cell applications. In addition to the definition of representative reference and stressor operating conditions, the document also provides a rationale for their selection. The use of sound science-based, industry-endorsed test methodologies and protocols enables true comparison of MEAs originating from different sources either commercial or developed within different projects. It also enables evaluating the rate of progress achieved towards reaching agreed technology performance targets. JRC. F. 2 -Energy Conversion and Storage Technologie...|$|E

For the rotor blades the external heat-transfer rates appear to have been between those predicted from cascade and earlier turbine test data.

In {{light of the}} fact that pump behavior is known to change significantly under these conditions, a new closed-loop test facility has been designed and constructed to allow for testing of twin-screw pumps at high gas volume fractions. With minimal modification, the test facility can accommodate high pressure flows and oil-based liquids for testing. The closed-loop test facility supplies air and water to the inlet of an MR- 200 twin-screw pump of which the performance characteristics are desired. The flow of air and water can be regulated to give the desired <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> outlet pressure, and gas volume fraction. The resulting mixture is driven to the test pump by its inlet suction. It then passes through the pump to a gravity separator, where it is separated into discrete liquid and <b>gas</b> phases. <b>Inlet</b> <b>pressures</b> up to seventy-five psig can be used, and with minimal modification, up to three-hundred psig.

The fundamental difficulty of pattern matching comes from peak pattern distortions that are caused by differences in data acquisition conditions. This paper investigates peak pattern variations related to varying oven temperature ramp rate and <b>inlet</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> and evaluates two types of affine transformations for matching peak patterns. The experimental results suggest that, over the experimental ranges, the changes in temperature ramp rate generate non-linear pattern variations and changes in gas pressure generate nearly linear pattern variations. The results indicate the affine transformations can largely remove the pattern variations {{and can be used}} for applications such as pattern matching and normalizing retention times to retention indices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} MEMS {{technology}} {{to design and}} fabricate a micro-bubble generator by a piezoelectric actuator. Coupled with a nickel nozzle plate, an annular piezoelectric ceramic was utilized as the primary structure of the generator. In operations, the piezoelectric element deforms transversely under an electric field applied across the thickness of the generator. The surface of the nozzle plate can expand or contract because of the induction of radial strain, resulting in the whole structure to bend, and successively transport oxygen micro-bubbles into the blood flow for enhancing the oxygen content in blood. In the tests, a high magnification microscope and a high speed CCD camera were employed to photograph the time evolution of meniscus shape of gaseous bubbles dispensed from the micro-bubble generator for flow visualization. This investigation thus explored the bubble formation process including the influences of <b>inlet</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> along with driving voltage and resonance frequency on the formed bubble extent...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of a PEM fuel cell is investigated experimentally. Some parameters such as input oxygen temperature, input hydrogen temperature, cell temperature, input pressure, oxygen flow rate and hydrogen flow rate affect {{the performance}} of the cell. A series of experiments are carried out to investigate the influence of the above parameters on the polarization curve under the normal conditions. A PEM fuel cell with 25 cm 2 active area and Nafion 117 membrane for the anode and cathode is employed as a membrane electrode assembly. The results show that increase in the operating temperature of the cell and <b>inlet</b> <b>gases</b> and <b>pressure</b> can enhance the cell performance. Also the results show that when the oxygen flow rate is at 0. 9 L/min and the hydrogen flow rate is at 0. 5 L/min {{the performance of}} the cell increases...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} engine system {{simulation}} using thermodynamics and chemical kinetic models {{to investigate the}} performance and efficiency of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines for stationary applications. It includes the development of software as well as models for engine, turbocharger, intercooler, inlet and exhaust manifolds, wastegate valve, inlet air humidifier, inlet air heater and more. The engine model can be classified as a one-zone, zero-dimensional and includes sub-models for in-cylinder heat transfer, exhaust port heat transfer, heat release and the valve flow process. The turbocharger model is developed in steps {{and is based on}} a polynomial fit to experimental compressor and turbine performance data. Inlet and exhaust manifolds are treated as well-mixed volumes. A simplified model for the humidifier is adopted in order to simulate a humid air motor (HAM) concept. The whole engine system is zero dimensional and the different system components are linked by means of mean values for mass flow, temperatures, pressures and gas composition. The NASA-polynomials are used for calculating thermal and transport properties. The extended Zeldovich mechanism is used as an indicator of significant NO formation. The models are validated through comparisons with experiments on mainly diesel and HCCI engines, both cycle and system results. HCCI engine cycle simulations are made, showing the influence of various engine parameters e. g. compression ratio, engine speed, air-fuel ratio, exhaust <b>gas</b> recycling, <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> and valve timing. Mainly natural gas and landfill gas are studied. The self-stabilizing feature of HCCI ignition timing is investigated using chemical kinetics. HCCI engine system simulations are made, both with (to find ignition timing) and without chemical kinetics, investigating turbocharging and the influence of turbine size. The HCCI - HAM concept is investigated and compared to simpler systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} applied {{thermodynamics}} principles {{to evaluate the}} reliability of 390 [*]m 3 /hr natural gas processing plant. The thermodynamics equations were utilized in the evaluation, characterization, and numerical simulation of key process parameters in natural gas liquid extraction plant. The results obtained show the comparison of the coefficient of performance, compression ratio, isentropic work, actual work, electrical power requirements, cooling water consumption in intercoolers, compressor power output, compressor capacity, and isentropic, volumetric, and mechanical efficiency of the two-stage refrigeration unit with a flash gas economizer and these were compared with the designed specifications. The second law of thermodynamics was applied in analyzing the refrigeration unit and the result shows that exergetic losses or lost work due to irreversibility falls within operating limit that is less than 1. 0 %. Similarly, the performance of expansion turbine (expander) parameters was monitored and the results indicate a considerable decrease in turbine efficiencies as the <b>inlet</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> increases resulting in an increased power output of the turbine leading to a higher liquefaction rate...|$|R
