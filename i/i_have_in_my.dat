500|$|According to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] {{is about}} [...] "all the rings of {{communication}} around the world. All the rings of pollution, {{and all the}} radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize {{all the things we}} don't see, Earth could look like some kind of fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> headâ€“ surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, Perry {{began work}} on her fourth album, Prism. She told Billboard, [...] "I know exactly the record I want to make next. I know the artwork, the {{coloring}} and the tone" [...] and [...] "I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head becomes a reality." [...] Although she told L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have [...] "darker elements" [...] in Prism {{following the end of}} her marriage, Perry revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. She commented [...] "I felt very prismatic", which inspired the album's name. [...] "Roar" [...] was released as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013. It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Unconditionally" [...] was released as the second single from Prism on October 16, 2013, and peaked at number 14 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would {{be a little bit more}} of an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 1978, Irv Rubin, {{chairman}} of the JDL, said about the planned American Nazi Party march in Skokie, Illinois: [...] "We are offering $500, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand, to {{any member of the}} community [...] who kills, maims or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi party." [...] Rubin was charged with solicitation of murder but was acquitted in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Fancy {{pictures}} seldom sell & {{they generally}} {{take more time}} than views so I have determined to paint one of the latter. [...] I have already commenced a view from Mt.

2500|$|Fronto {{never became}} Marcus' {{full-time}} teacher, and continued {{his career as}} an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes. Fronto had been retained as defense counsel by Tiberius Claudius Demostratus, a prominent Athenian. Herodes Atticus was chief prosecutor. Because of Herodes' fraught relationship {{with the city of}} Athens, the defense's strategy would probably include attacks on his character. Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with [...] "advice", then as a [...] "favor", not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows. Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), but allowed that Marcus might be correct, and agreed that the case should not be made into a spectacle. He nonetheless affirmed his intent {{to make use of the}} material available: [...] "I warn you that I won't even use in a disproportionate way the opportunity that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> case, for the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death." [...] Marcus was satisfied with Fronto's response.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> enough <b>in</b> this {{discourse}} fully to satisfy all my curiosity, and sufficiently to heighten my desire {{of making the}} farther discoveries which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> thoughts.|$|R
