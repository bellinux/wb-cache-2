5|$|Krøyer {{had visited}} the atelier where Marie was {{studying}} on several occasions, but {{the first of his}} works in which she appears is A Duet, painted in Heinrich Hirschsprung's Copenhagen home in 1887 where she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> model for him.

5|$|Though Obama {{indicated}} in January 2010 that a consensus {{had not been}} made about whether she would campaign, speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the International Bowl following their victory over then-undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Although in past years the MAC champion <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the Motor City Bowl, Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than Detroit, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to Division I-A and joining the MAC in 1999.|$|E

He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> become the Liberal candidate for Cambridge in 1911, but he refused because he had no income; he did, however, help his employer George Cadbury, Jr. get elected as a Liberal Councillor in Birmingham and helped start a branch of the National League of Young Liberals in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> Havana by British {{world music}} {{producer}} Nick Gold of World Circuit Records {{to record a}} session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it transpired that the musicians from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.|$|E
5|$|Weisberger {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> make cameo appearances as themselves in the film {{that they would be}} banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E

Toscanini <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> conduct the last of these, but he told the promoters that Monteux was his dearest colleague and the best conductor for Falstaff.|$|E
5|$|Edward <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, {{the home}} of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, {{a friend of the}} prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E
5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E

5|$|The two princes {{had been}} in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani, the only {{daughter}} of Lekë Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. In 1445, the Albanian princes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the wedding of Skanderbeg's younger sister, Mamica, who was being married to Muzaka Thopia. Irene entered the wedding and hostilities began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him, but Zaharia, who was drunk, saw this, and assaulted Dukagjini. Some princes attempted to stop the fight, but only more people became involved. Several people died or got injured before peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any physical damage, but after the event Dukagjini was morally humiliated.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 9November, about 150 councillors {{gathered}} for a two-day meeting in Stuttgart. A majority of the councillors entrusted {{the leaders of the}} SPD and USPD political parties, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the meeting, with the establishment of a provisional government in Württemberg. The Spartacist Albert Schreiner, then chairman of a soldier council, initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government, which for the time being shared power with the councils. However, he resigned already a few days later, after disputes about the future course of the government. While the Spartacists considered as their ideal aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year's October Revolution in Russia, the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a parliamentary democracy and early elections in Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Italy, Baker became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged Italian thrillers, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, Baker <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in Her Harem (1967). This was followed with the horror films The Sweet Body of Deborah (1968) and The Devil Has Seven Faces (1971). Baker also starred in So Sweet... So Perverse (1969), Paranoia (1969), A Quiet Place to Kill (1970), and Il coltello di ghiaccio (Knife of Ice) (1972), all horror films directed by Italian filmmaker Umberto Lenzi.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} the NFL draft, lasting six hours, eight minutes. One of the big stories of the draft was the fall of Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn. Quinn had been {{projected}} as a potential first overall pick in early mock drafts and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> attend the draft in person, but he wasn't selected until the 22nd pick in the first round by the Cleveland Browns, who acquired the pick in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys. Louisiana State University quarterback JaMarcus Russell was selected first overall by the Oakland Raiders after he had replaced Quinn as the projected first selection among most analysts following his performance in the 2007 Sugar Bowl against Quinn and Notre Dame. Russell is considered by many as one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history, and Quinn also had a largely unsuccessful pro career.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the bulk}} of the revolt took place in and around the {{legislature}} over the issue of social credit and government fiscal policy, Aberhart was also under attack on other fronts. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, set for May1937 in London, and planned to go. Douglas, challenged by Hargrave for the leadership of the social credit movement and under attack by some of his own followers for his lack of cooperation with the world's first social credit government, offered to host Aberhart, and a member of Douglas's social credit secretariat was planning a speaking tour for Aberhart. In the same speech in which he threatened to bring down the government on the supply motion, Blue attacked the trip as an extravagance that depression-ridden Alberta could ill afford. Faced with a political insurgency at home, Aberhart reluctantly decided at the end of March to cancel his trip, inaccurately claiming that he had never definitely decided to go.|$|E
