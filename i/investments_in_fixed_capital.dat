40|$|The article {{describes}} characteristics and trends of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> of the Northern regions. It singles out phases of rapid pre-crisis growth, crisis, post-crisis growth and stagnation. Stagnation and decline {{in recent years}} are caused by completed major investment projects, reduced own funds of enterprises, limited availability of investment resources and increased capital outflow. The article reveals that the growth of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> of the North in the post-crisis period {{is provided by the}} regions, carrying out major <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> oil and gas pipeline transport, oil extraction, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. The changes in the sectoral structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> of the Northern regions are barely visible; the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the traded sector is still high, especially in mining, due to the Northern regions’ specialization in the extractive industries. The share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the public sector and social services remains low. The specific structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> has changed: the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> buildings (excluding housing) and structures has increased greatly; the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles has decreased due to insufficient <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> mining enterprises and financial shortages in manufacturing.

40|$|In their {{relations}} with the external world, banks face two basic kinds of infor-mation problems: ascertaining the creditworthiness of those to whom they loan their funds, and convincing those from whom they obtain funds of their own creditworthiness. This essay uses the historical experience of banks in nineteenth-century New England to explore the interaction between these two kinds of information problems and the policies bankers adopted in granting loans. I argue that as credit markets grew increasingly large and impersonal {{over the course of}} the century, bankers found it more and more difficult to evaluate the financial standing of potential borrowers and also to inform de-positors and investors about their own performance.

40|$|Transportation, as {{the service}} of moving {{commodities}} between places, plays a unique role in a fully competitive capitalist space-economy. The commodity of transportation is consumed {{as a part of}} virtually every economic transaction, linking the production and consumption of a commodity; demand for transportation is derived from spatial configurations rather than being fixed by socially necessary techniques and real wages; and the circulation time taken in transportation is a deduction from capitalists' profits. The impact of circulation time on profits may be calculated precisely. The derived nature of the demand for transportation adds a level of uncertainty to the impact of cost-reducing technical change on profit rates. Given this, cost-reducing and time-reducing technical change in the transportation commodity {{is one of the few}} ways of ensuring an increased rate of profit for capitalists, ceteris paribus.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to gauge the impact of the {{production}} of knowledge on the accumulation of fixed capital in Brazil. The hypothesis is that investment in R&D causes investment in fixed capital in Brazilian industrial firms. The empirical estimates rest on an IPEA database for information on firms and the workers linked to these firms during the period 1996 - 2003 and on the National Innovation Survey (PINTEC) for information on technological development. In the article, various estimates are made using three empirical procedures. First, the firms that grew most and invested most are described. Second, econometric models relating R&D expenditures, technological innovation and the accumulation of fixed capital are estimated. A model having five equations and a structure similar to that of CDM models is estimated. The system employs instrumental variables to correct for endogeneity and solves the selection problem by including a firm-survival equation. Third, the causal relations between R&D and investment in fixed capital are sought through contrafactual analysis and a difference model. The results support the initial hypothesis, indicating that investments in R&D lead to an average 17 % increase in <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> among Brazilian firms. firm growth, knowledge production, R&D, innovation, simultaneous equation models...|$|E

40|$|The current {{economic}} situation in rural territories {{is characterized by}} many challenges to their sustainable development. The level {{and quality of life}} in rural areas, underdevelopment of social infrastructure, the environmental situation significantly contributes to the depopulation of the rural territories. In this regard, {{it is very important to}} research and discuss the possible decision of problems of development of rural settlements. The actions of the state on formation of the complex of normative-legal documents regulating state policy in the field of rural development are aimed at ensuring the management of these areas by federal authorities which leads to some extent to resource dependence on it, and reduces the motivation of regional and municipal management to the formation of effective policy of rural development. The management of the regions chooses its directions of developing rural areas, without taking into account the prevailing socio-economic situation at the municipal level and features of development of rural settlements, which reduces the effectiveness of the management of the territory. As an example the authors have evaluated the level of rural areas development in Orel Region and proposed a classification of areas at regional level.

40|$|Recently, {{the field}} of {{comparative}} political economy has turned to the Chinese economy. Coherent interpretation of the drivers and fundamental institutions of China’s economic system had been frustrated by the coexistence of, on the one hand, continuously developing capitalist institutions and a burgeoning market economy, and on the other, the persisting and proliferating authoritarian system of economic administration. Therefore, commonplace dichotomous frameworks of capitalism/ socialism, or coordinated/market economies are but of little avail. Building on concepts from regulation theory, this thesis argues that the current system is one wherein state and market institutions support a distinctively industrialist orientation. The Leninist apparatus of bureaucratic controls has come to instill a dynamic wherein economic performance begets political influence, and political stature commands control of capital. Financial markets complement industrial demands for capital, while the ostensibly ‘liberalist’ reorganization {{of the public sector}} and welfare system have attenuated the financial pressures on enterprise exerted by labor. As a result of the common interest of political actors and industrialists in the continuous expansion of productive capital, growth has occurred predominantly through <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital.</b> Stringent limitations exist which undermine achievement of long-term sustainability of the current state-industrialist nexus. Lack of compensatory mechanisms for disenfranchised constituents and the dearth of indigenous innovation are pertinent problems, and moreover, mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, without a continuous increase in relative surplus value (i. e. output per worker) a more egalitarian distribution of income seems unlikely, while on the other, the lack of individual purchasing power subverts intentions to transition towards a model of growth premised on domestic consumption. Indeed, exceptions exist (for example within the telecommunications industry, but ultimately growth in upstream sectors requires commensurate growth in downstream industries. The Chinese ‘variety of capitalism’ is indeed an idiosyncratic one, but seems to have exhausted its potential...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{economic}} development tools used by practitioners to facilitate growth on regional and municipal level. One of such tools is a strategic planning process. It helps local governments to set goals and priorities for community development and to coordinate activities in different areas of community life. It also helps to establish partnership among stakeholders and interest groups. This enables communities to mobilize public and private resources, to consolidate efforts of various groups and, by these means, to streamline economic development. Despite a large number of applications, {{there is a lack of}} rigorous evaluation results. This lack is related to two major difficulties: 1) The planning procedure differs greatly in the implementation details from case to case. That makes the comparison complicated (if at all possible). 2) The decision to start the planning process in most cases is thought to be predetermined by growth outcomes. Cities that are more likely to benefit from the planning are more likely to get involved into the process. Thus, it is almost impossible to tell if planning causes growth or economic growth leads to planning. The project "Local Economic Development in Ukraine" (LED) allows overcoming the above mentioned difficulties. This project is implemented by the USAID in 76 Ukrainian cities starting in 2004. The project helps local governments to initiate and to implement a process of strategic planning. It is done consistently using the same procedure in all participating cities that were initially chosen by the project administration. This paper evaluates the effect of LED using data of Ukrainian State Statistics Bureau on minor administrative units (cities and rural districts) for the period of 2003 - 2008. The analysis reveals that communities that have started a strategic planning with the LED are able to increase the number of businesses per capita, the amount of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital,</b> and the number of jobs per capita in a short run. It also has affected the unemployment rate in a longer run...|$|E
40|$|The uneven {{distribution}} {{of economic activity}} in Russia promotes the differentiation of its constituent entities by level of development. Regions are independent participants of economic relations, and they often act as competitors rather than partners. Agglomeration effects arise in more successful regions {{and contribute to the}} concentration of resources, manufacturing enterprises, service providers, skilled workers, and scientific and technological knowledge. The aim of the study, the results of which are reflected in the paper, is to identify the factors and assess their impact on the concentration (dispersion) of economic activity on the basis of Russia’s regions. The paper describes the benefits of agglomeration processes from the standpoint of economic geography, allocation theory and international trade theory. The concentration of economic activity in Russia’s regions is estimated by the Herfindahl–Hirschman index of industrial production taking into consideration the volume of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> and the number of people employed in the economy in Russia’s regions in 1990 – 2013. It is determined that fixed capital investments have the propensity to concentrate, but react strongly to economic crises. Labor resources, by contrast, are distributed relatively evenly, and their concentration in certain regions is increasing steadily. The article considers key factors such as wage growth, distance to large cities, direct foreign investment, road network density, the degree of development of the services sector in the region. The factor model is constructed using the least squares method. The authors conclude that the growth of wages in the region (relative to national average) has a negative effect on the concentration of economic activity. There is a positive correlation between the growth of direct foreign investment and the density of hard surface roads. The development of services has the greatest positive impact on agglomeration processes in Russia’s regions. The paper confirms the point of the new economic geography concerning the negative impact that the region’s remoteness from major markets exerts on the development of agglomeration process. The authors agree with foreign researchers {{on the fact that the}} emergence and development of agglomeration process is influenced by increasing returns to scale, transport costs and labor migration. But the very indirect factors included in the model are influenced by economic actors in the regional socio-economic polic...|$|E
