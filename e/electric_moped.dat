50|$|In 2010, Peel Engineering Ltd in England started re-manufacturing the P50 and Trident {{models from}} its {{premises}} in Sutton-in-Ashfield, England. Externally this car {{is very similar}} to the original, but with mechanical differences in the suspension, steering, and drive-train, as well as a fully functioning reverse gear, ensuring they are road legal on today's roads. Petrol models with a 49 cc, four-stroke engine are being produced, as well as electric models with an <b>electric</b> <b>moped</b> motor and gelled-electrolyte batteries. The top speed of both cars is about 28 mph.|$|E
5000|$|On June 5, 2013, {{six months}} after his first attempt, Hershner {{successfully}} completed the first trip across the United States on an electric motorcycle (Kanichi Fujiwara did it a decade earlier {{as part of a}} global circumnavigation, but on an <b>electric</b> <b>moped).</b> The solo trip from San Diego, CA to Jacksonville, FL took five days, or 135 hours, with no support vehicle and using only the existing charging infrastructure. Despite having to replace a motor due to a loose sprocket, Hershner completed the trip roughly 36 hours before another electric motorcycle team, also attempting to become the first to ever cross the country. As a result, Hershner became the first person in history to [...] "unofficially" [...] go coast to coast on an electric motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|A pedelec (from pedal {{electric}} cycle) is {{a bicycle}} where the rider's pedalling is assisted {{by a small}} electric motor; thus it {{is a type of}} low-powered e-bike. However, unlike some other types of e-bikes, pedelecs are classified as conventional bicycles in many countries by road authorities rather than as a type of <b>electric</b> <b>moped.</b> Pedelecs include an electronic controller which cuts power to the motor when the rider is not pedalling or when a certain speed - usually 25 km/h - is reached. Pedelecs are useful for people who ride in hilly areas or in strong headwinds. While a pedelec can be any type of bicycle, a pedelec city bike is very common. A conventional bicycle can be converted to a pedelec with the addition of the necessary parts, i.e. motor, battery etc.|$|E
50|$|Every person {{riding a}} bicycle, {{electric}} personal assistive mobility device, <b>electric</b> power-assistedbicycle, <b>moped,</b> or an animal or driving an animal {{on a highway}} shall {{be subject to the}} provisions of thischapter and shall have all of the rights and duties applicable to the driver of a vehicle, unless thecontext of the provision clearly indicates otherwise.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{bicycles}} are {{not allowed}} in any public area, meaning an area where there is full or partial public access. Any kind of pedal assist, <b>electric</b> bike, scooter, <b>moped</b> or vehicle which has any form of propulsion, whether in full or as assist, other than human power, must be approved as either a car, motorcycle, van, truck, bus or similar. This makes tilt-controlled two-wheel personal vehicles, and pedelecs illegal in all practical ways, as they cannot be registered as a motor cycle.|$|R
50|$|Pere Gimbernat i Quintana, founder's {{grandson}} and Engineer, {{had advanced}} ideas for that time. One was {{to produce the}} first <b>electric</b> <b>moped</b> in Catalonia. The prototype was presented in 1973 Barcelona's show, it had a Bosch engine. The prototype never when into production. Pere Gimbernat i Quintana was responsible for naming the new models, among which we find the successful Canigó, Polaris and Skipper. Moreover he managed {{the whole process of}} the well known commercial catalogs for their products (famous for its photographic and documentary quality. They were printed at local printing plants in Figueres), looking for the best spot to take the pictures, always landscapes from Empordà (the catalog pictures for the model Canigó were taken at Sant Llorenç de la Muga and the ones for the brands main catalog were taken at Empuriabrava).|$|E
