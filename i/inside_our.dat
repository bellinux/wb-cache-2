Ekman claims that the face is a rich source {{of what is going on}} <b>inside</b> <b>our</b> mind and although many facial expressions can be made voluntarily, our faces are also dictated by an involuntary system that automatically expresses our emotions.|$|E
25|$|An {{instantaneous}} evaluation about {{intentions of}} an approaching person or subject based upon visual clues might have very strong connection with initial stages of biological evolution. The reason why it happens so quickly <b>inside</b> <b>our</b> brains {{has to do with}} both risks and benefits subjected with any person or subject that is being encountered at very first time. The latency time of an entire evaluation process suggests a crucial adaption done by pre-historic creatures based upon their earlier experiences of encounters with strangers. Lesser time the process of identification takes, better are the chances of survival.|$|E

25|$|Other constructivist {{scholars}} {{agree with}} this and emphasize that individuals make meanings through the interactions {{with each other and}} with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed (Ernest 1991; Prawat and Floden 1994). McMahon (1997) agrees that learning is a social process. He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place <b>inside</b> <b>our</b> minds, nor is it a passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.|$|E

500|$|The task of {{creating}} God's voice {{was given to}} Lon Bender and the team working with the film's music composer, Hans Zimmer.

[...] "We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows, and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well. The solution was to use the voice of actor Val Kilmer to suggest the kind of voice we hear <b>inside</b> <b>our</b> own heads in our everyday lives, as opposed to the larger than life tones with which God has been endowed in prior cinematic incarnations." ...|$|E

In June 1959, the Packers, in one of their first major personnel moves under Lombardi, purchased Tunnell from the Giants.

Margaret Thatcher, in a lecture in November 1984 delivered a month after she survived an assassination attempt that killed five senior Conservatives, referred to a spectrum of groups undermining rule of law: [...] "At one end of the spectrum are the terrorist gangs within our borders, and the terrorist states which finance and arm them.
