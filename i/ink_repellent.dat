50|$|The Javanese word batik designates a {{technology}} of coloring with spares where the coloring happens with an <b>ink</b> <b>repellent</b> liquid or paste like wax, resin or starch. The spare material is applied, drawn or stamped on the fabric protecting these {{parts of the}} fabric (pattern) in the color bath and creating a light pattern after removal.|$|E
50|$|After exposure, {{the plate}} {{is ready for}} processing. Processing {{equipment}} for the waterless plate is unique to this system, using specialized chemical and mechanical treatment of the plate. The finished plate now has a non-image area composed of <b>ink</b> <b>repellent</b> silicone. In the image area, the silicone has been removed to expose the ink receptive photopolymer material. This design allows the plate to selectively attract and resist ink {{without the use of}} any water, etches or alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Formulators in the paint, <b>ink,</b> adhesives, water <b>repellents,</b> {{and other}} related {{industries}} require materials that resist peeling and penetration in spite of prolonged exposure to heat, cold, moisture, and chemical attack. Research into these problems resulted {{in the development of}} alkoxy functional silanes for use as adhesion promoters, crosslinkers, and hydrophobes. The intent {{of this paper is to}} briefly review the unique chemistry of this class of materials and to discuss three areas of product development that have benefited from the utilization of silanes: surface treatment, additive, and reactive intermediate. This discussion will include recommendations for specific organic/silane combinations...|$|R
50|$|Two {{weeks into}} the next series of tests, 72 {{consecutive}} positive results convince Ben that they've found the answer. Evans still shows reluctance, suggesting two more weeks of trials are needed, so Ben angrily pulls rank on him and orders the results submitted. Carlos accidentally falls overboard while clowning around on the boat, and swims into the repellent cloud for protection. He panics and stabs a shark that ventures too close, drawing a pack that kills him despite the repellent. After Carlos' funeral, the demoralized Evans rebels when Ben suggests they try an earlier theory about using octopod <b>ink</b> as a <b>repellent.</b> He admits his resentment of being told by Ben how to do his job, and of not being listened to when he had doubts about the repellent that didn't save Carlos. Ben agrees not to push for results this time, but announces that if the tests are conclusive, he's {{going to put a}} man in the water to test it before he sends it up. When tests with an octopus are promising, Duncan creates a <b>repellent</b> combining synthetic <b>ink,</b> copper acetate, and water-soluble wax to keep dissipation from occurring. He volunteers as the human bait but Ben is noncommittal.|$|R
