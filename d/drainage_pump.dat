50|$|The Nasiriyah <b>Drainage</b> <b>Pump</b> Station {{is a land}} {{drainage}} pumping station in Iraq 10 km southeast of Nasiriyah {{in the province of}} Dhi Qar. The station pumps farm run-off collected by the Main Outfall Drain (MOD) north of the Euphrates River in Dhi Qar and Muthanna provinces to a siphon under the Euphrates where it is then returned to the MOD and eventually discharged in the Persian Gulf. The pump station relieves water back-up and is a critical component of a larger agricultural drainage system designed to drain 1.5 million hectares of land in order to reduce soil salinity. Consisting of 12 pumps, each with a 20 m³/second (316,000 gal/min) capacity, it is the largest <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> in the Middle East.|$|E
5000|$|The cypress swamp {{adjacent}} to the stream (Chickasaw Bogue or Chickasaw Creek) was drained, dikes were constructed, and <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps</b> were installed. [...] Simultaneously, a company town was constructed to house and serve the shipyard workers.|$|R
50|$|On the Pyramid's opening night, {{the arena}} floor flooded because of {{inadequate}} <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{and the entire}} arena began to flood causing stage hands to sandbag the entire perimeter to preserve the electrical runs under the stage.|$|R
50|$|While the {{majority}} of the city's <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps</b> were able to be reactivated after the storm, some of the usually reliable pumps failed in 2006 due to corrosion. This was caused by wiring being submerged in the brackish water from Katrina.|$|R
50|$|This system {{provides}} for the installation of a <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> for each well. The distribution of the wells is established according to the permeability of the land to be drained and the lowering of the water pressure to be achieved. The use of isolated wells with drainage pumps leads to high operational costs and imposes a very time-consuming level of control and maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|The Wood Screw Pump is a low-lift axial-flow <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> {{designed}} by A. Baldwin Wood in 1913 {{to cope with}} the drainage problems of New Orleans. Until the installation of Wood's extremely efficient pumps, the city had experienced chronic flooding problems, bringing diseases such as malaria and yellow fever together with contamination of drinking water supplies. The pumps are driven by [...] synchronous General Electric motors, built in the early 1900s. They were designed to lift a large volume of water over levees some 10 m high, into Lake Pontchartrain.|$|E

50|$|Clayrack {{drainage}} windmill {{is not on}} {{its original}} position. It was moved in 1981 from its previous site on Ranworth Marshes 2¾ miles to the south. The mill was in a terrible state of repair and {{was in danger of}} being lost for ever. It was decided that it was worth saving and a restoration program was set up. As Ranworth marsh hosted many nesting birds which would have been vulnerable to any disturbance caused by the work the decision was taken to move Clayrack windpump to its present position at How Hill. Now fully restored the mill can sometimes be seen operating in its original capacity as a <b>drainage</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
50|$|The British colonial {{administrators were}} the first to attempt to drain the marshes, {{motivated}} by their role as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and lack of apparent economic value, as well as the potential use of the water for irrigation. Prepared in 1951, The Haigh Report outlined a series of sluices, embankments and canals on the lower ends of the Tigris and Euphrates that would drain water for agriculture. These notably included the Main Outfall Drain (MOD), a large canal also referred to as the Third River, and the Nasiriyah <b>Drainage</b> <b>Pump</b> Station. Neither were completed under British rule: they were later revived by the Ba'athist government.|$|E
5000|$|Many Jefferson Parish {{residents}} {{joined in}} a class action lawsuit against Broussard after he followed a years-old [...] "doomsday plan" [...] {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Katrina and evacuated more than 200 <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> operators north to Washington Parish. The pumps remained off for more than two days and sections of the parish, including Metairie and Kenner, experienced severe flooding as a result of rain water, backflow from Lake Ponchartrain and flood waters from the broken 17th Street Canal. Broussard defended his actions, saying that he wanted to protect the pump operators' lives, even though some pump operators were willing to stay. Other public officials, such as police and fire departments, did not evacuate. Water department workers also stayed.|$|E
25|$|The method uses {{seasonal}} {{water balance}} components as input data. These {{are related to}} the surface hydrology (like rainfall, evaporation, irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, runoff), and the aquifer hydrology (like upward seepage, natural <b>drainage,</b> <b>pumping</b> from wells). The other water balance components (like downward percolation, upward capillary rise, subsurface drainage) are given as output.|$|R
50|$|The {{first decade}} of the 20th century saw further improvements. A second pumping station was added closer to the lake at Florida Boulevard (near the current I-610). In 1906 the steam {{locomotive}} running along the line was replaced with electric streetcars. The early 20th century a greatly improved <b>drainaged</b> <b>pumping</b> system designed by A. Baldwin Wood was installed.|$|R

50|$|By the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, the marshes had lost 90% of their size {{from the previous}} decades. The Central and Hammar Marshes were nearly drained and only 35% of the Hawizeh Marshes remained. After the invasion, locals destroyed dikes. The combined efforts of the Iraq government, United Nations, U.S. agencies and record precipitation in Turkey helped begin a restoration of the marshes. As of late 2006, 58% of the original marshes had been reinundated. The Nasiriyah <b>Drainage</b> <b>Pump</b> Station was completed in 2009, affording the Third River {{to be used for}} agricultural drainage. However, recent drought and continued upstream dam construction and operation in Turkey, Syria and Iran have reduced the marshes to around 30% of their original size by 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1901 Per Alfred Stenberg {{established}} a foundry {{in the small}} town of Emmaboda in southern Sweden. One of the main products was moulds for the glass industry. Per Alfred transfer ownership of the company to his sons. In 1922 Hilding Flygt set up a pump and fan sales company in Stockholm. Through a newspaper advertisement the two companies are brought into contact with one another in 1929, and led to the Stenberg brothers beginning to produce Flygt pumps in Emmaboda. Sixten Englesson, chief engineer, invented the first submersible <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> in 1947 and the first submersible sewage pump in 1956. In 1968 the Stenberg family sold the company to ITT Corporation. During the 1970s, the product range was expanded with mixers and other products.|$|E
50|$|The Hanami River (Hanami-gawa) is a {{river in}} Yachiyo and Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. The river is 18.9 km {{in length and}} has a {{drainage}} area of 94.5 km2. The Hanami is {{one part of the}} Inba Discharge Channel (Inba Hōsuiro). The upper part of the drainage facility is designated as the Shin River. The lower part, the Hanami, ranges from the Ōwada <b>Drainage</b> <b>Pump</b> Station in Yachiyo City, and drains into Tokyo Bay in the Mihama Ward of Chiba City. The lower part of the river where the Hanami empties into Tokyo Bay is known as the Kemi River (Kemi-gawa). Numerous sluices have been built on the Hanami to protect the surrounding area from damage due to high tides and typhoons.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 2015, floodwaters {{driven by}} Typhoon Etau {{prompted}} mass evacuations in Japan and overwhelmed the <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps</b> at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant. A TEPCO spokesperson said {{that hundreds of}} metric tons of radioactive water had entered the ocean as a result. Plastic bags filled with contaminated soil and grass were also swept away by the flood waters.|$|R
50|$|While {{he spent}} most of his career in New Orleans, Wood also {{consulted}} and designed the <b>drainage,</b> <b>pumping,</b> and sewage systems for other cities including Chicago, Milwaukee, Baltimore, and San Francisco, as well as projects in Canada, Egypt, China, and India. His work was especially helpful in the Zuiderzee Works, which reclaimed large areas of land from the Zuider Zee in the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Tanglin Mall and St Regis did {{not receive}} flood alerts from the PUB which was due to a {{technical}} glitch in the flood alert software, which PUB will rectify.
