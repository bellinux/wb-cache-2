5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the <b>fuel</b> <b>starvation</b> scenario.|$|E

Growth indices including body weight, SGR, CF, and HSI significantly decreased after starvation. However, after re-feeding sturgeons that were starved for 1 week {{reached the same}} weight as the control, indicating that complete compensatory growth had occurred. Conversely, sturgeon in longer periods of starvation showed only partial growth compensation. HSI values decreased significantly during starvation, although {{they returned to the}} control fish levels after re-feeding. Plasma levels of glucose and insulin during starvation and re-feeding did not significantly change. This suggests that sturgeon is able to maintain glycaemia during starvation, probably due to their non-carbohydrates source dietary.

40|$|Human {{subjects}} vary in {{the extent}} to which their body's protein and fat compartments are mobilized for <b>fuel</b> during <b>starvation.</b> Although an inverse association between the initial adiposity and the contribution of protein as <b>fuel</b> during <b>starvation</b> has been known for nearly a century, interest in the quantitative importance and functional significance of the initial percentage fat as a determinant of biological variation in energy-partitioning between protein and fat (and hence in determining the partitioning characteristic of the individual) is relatively recent. The present paper addresses these issues by revisiting the classic Minnesota experiment of semi-starvation and refeeding from a standpoint of system physiology. In a quantitative analysis {{of the relationship between the}} initial body composition (ratio FAT 0 :fat-free mass (FFM) 0) and the composition of weight loss (ratio ΔFAT:ΔFFM) in the thirty-two men in the Minnesota study, the arguments are put forward that the fraction of FFM lost when the fat stores reach total depletion is independent of the initial percentage fat, and that this fraction represents the ‘dispensible' component of the protein compartment that is compatible with life (i. e. the protein energy-reserve, rp). The concepts are developed that (1) the initial percentage body fat (which reflects the initial ratio FAT 0 :FFM 0) provides a ‘memory of partitioning' which dictates the control of partitioning between protein and fat in such a way that both the protein energy-reserve (rp) and the fat energy-reserve (rf) reach complete depletion simultaneously, a strategy that would ensure maximum length of survival during long-term food scarcity, and that (2) variability in the relative sizes of these two energy reserves (i. e. in rf:rp) could, in addition to the initial percentage fat, also contribute to human variability in energy-partitioning. The basic assumptions underlying this re-analysis of the Minnesota data, and the concepts that are derived from it, have been integrated in the simple mathematical model for predicting the partitioning characteristic of the individual. This model is used to explain how variability in the fraction of the protein compartment that could function as an energy reserve (rp) can be as important as the initial percentage fat in determining inter-individual variability in protein-sparing during the early phase of <b>starvation,</b> in <b>fuel</b> partitioning during prolonged starvation, or in the maximum percentage weight loss during starvation. The elucidation of factors underlying variability in the size of the protein energy-reserve may have important implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology of starvation and age-associated susceptibility to muscle wasting, and in the clinical management of cachexia and obesit...|$|R

40|$|Plasma free {{fatty acids}} (also {{variously}} referred to as nonesterified fatty acids and unesterified fatty acids) have assumed importance as a small but very rapidly metabolized component of serum lipids (1, 2). Their derivation from the fat of adipose tissue has been demonstrated and may represent an important form in which stored fat is mobilized, transported and made available for <b>fuel</b> during <b>starvation</b> (3). The concentration of {{free fatty acids}} (FFA) in plasma increases during starvation (4), in the "metabolic " starvation of diabetic acidosis (5) and of hyperthyroidism (6). When an overnight fast is terminated by the administration of 50 to 100 g of carbohydrate, an abrupt fall in concen-tration of plasma FFA occurs within one-half hour and lasts for several hours, and a similar but less marked drop follows a protein meal (1, 2). On the other hand, following a fat meal of equal or greater caloric value, the FFA either do not change appreciably or rise {{much as they do}} during a similar period of fasting (2, 7). The decrease in concentration of FFA appears to occur in response to an-increase in carbohy-drate utilization. The absence of such a drop in concentration after a fat meal would seem to indi-cate insensitivity of the FFA regulatory system to fat or merely the substitution of FFA derived from ingested fat for those derived from adi-pose fat (3). An alternative possibility is herein suggested, namely that relative inefficiency of fat metabolism in persons adapted to a high car...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Extending {{fuel cell}} {{lifetime}} {{is a necessary}} objective for reducing fuel cell power generation cost of electricity. Capital costs comprise the most significant {{fraction of the cost}} of electricity. Reducing the fre-quency of fuel cell replacement can be achieved by im-plementing a control strategy that prevents excursions into operating regions causing failure. In this paper we implement a constrained MIMO model predictive controller (MPC) to avoid the failure modes relevant for a high-temperature tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system while performing load-following. The primary causes of failure are catalyst poisoning, <b>fuel</b> or air <b>starvation,</b> carbon deposition, and microcracking. Prior steady-state thermomechanical stress analysis in literature has demonstrated that the minimum cell temperature and maximum negative radial thermal gradient are primary causes of microcracking in the SOFC. State-of-the-art SOFC control literature often seeks to track a mean or outlet cell temperature. The authors have presented the first approach to control the primary two causes of thermally-driven microc-racking in tubular SOFCs using constrained control. Constraints are also incorporated into a steady-state optimization to ensure a feasible optimum. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Triglycerides {{are stored}} lipids with high calorific value, and so {{may be the}} {{preferred}} choice of <b>fuel</b> during <b>starvation,</b> which may be partially utilized and also may be a simultaneously synthesized along the degradation, probably to balance the lipid over load and also to prevent lipotoxicity of cells caused due to accumulation of FFA(free fatty acids). There may not be any absolute depletion of lipids, during starvation as lipid {{is considered to be}} the element constant. To study and understand the relevance of triglycerides during starvation we selected, Anabas, testudineus, a sturdy fish from coastal waters of Andhra Pradesh (INDIA) and subjected it to brief (15 days) and prolonged fasting (60 days). Triglyceride concentration was estimated by the method of Raghuramulu et. al (1983). Six non adipose tissues, like liver, kidney, brain accessory respiratory organ, pectoral and lateral line muscle were chosen for the study. There was an overall upsurge observed in the triglyceride levels. During the short term fasting stress, the increase was found to be a significant one in tissues such as liver (P< 0. 01), kidney,(P< 0. 001) brain,(P< 0. 001) accessory respiratory organ(P< 0. 001) and lateral line muscle(P< 0. 001).

30|$|It is {{well-known}} that regulation of insulin-like signaling {{plays an important}} role in growth retardation, obesity, type 2 diabetes, life span, and oxidative resistance (Song et al., 2010). The anti-aging effect of YAP 2 has been discovered since down-regulating or silencing YAP 2 induces replicative senescence of IMR 90 human diploid cells in a TEAD and Rb/p 16 /p 53 pathway-dependent manner (Xie et al., 2013). The hepatic IRE 1 α promotes the adaptive shift of <b>fuel</b> utilization during <b>starvation</b> by stimulating mitochondrial β-oxidation and ketogenesis through the XBP 1  s-PPARα axis (Shao et al., 2014). Furthermore, the Grb 10 /mTOR signaling pathway has been identified to impact the biological changes of adipose tissue and the “brown” process of white adipose tissue (Zhang et al., 2012 a; Liu et al., 2014). Intriguingly, RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway has been found to mediate senescence and aging inflammation. The inflammation response associated with cell senescence is significantly decreased in MAVS-deficient cells and mice. By contrast, interfering with RIG-I in replicative senescence cells can reduce the inflammation response of aging and slow the cell aging process. Further research shows that the anti-aging protein Klotho can act as RIG-I inhibitor to antagonize RIG-I-induced senescence inflammation response, while knockout of Klotho leads to a significantly enhanced inflammatory response (Liu et al., 2011 a).|$|R
40|$|Background & AimsHepatic gluconeogenesis {{provides}} <b>fuel</b> during <b>starvation,</b> and is abnormally induced in obese {{individuals or}} those with diabetes. Common metabolic disorders associated with active gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance (obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) {{have been associated with}} alterations in iron homeostasis that disrupt insulin sensitivity and promote disease progression. We investigated whether gluconeogenic signals directly control Hepcidin, an important regulator of iron homeostasis, in starving mice (a model of persistently activated gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance). MethodsWe investigated hepatic regulation of Hepcidin expression in C 57 BL/ 6 Crl, 129 S 2 /SvPas, BALB/c, and Creb 3 l 3 –/– null mice. Mice were fed a standard, iron-balanced chow diet or an iron-deficient diet for 9 days before death, or for 7 days before a 24 - to 48 -hour starvation period; liver and spleen tissues then were collected and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses. Serum levels of iron, hemoglobin, Hepcidin, and glucose also were measured. We analyzed human hepatoma (HepG 2) cells and mouse primary hepatocytes to study transcriptional control of Hamp (the gene that encodes Hepcidin) in response to gluconeogenic stimuli using small interfering RNA, luciferase promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. ResultsStarvation led to increased transcription of the gene that encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (a protein involved in gluconeogenesis) in livers of mice, increased levels of Hepcidin, and degradation of Ferroportin, compared with nonstarved mice. These changes resulted in hypoferremia and iron retention in liver tissue. Livers of starved mice also had increased levels of Ppargc 1 a mRNA and Creb 3 l 3 mRNA, which encode a transcriptional co-activator involved in energy metabolism and a liver-specific transcription factor, respectively. Glucagon and a cyclic adenosine monophosphate analog increased promoter activity and transcription of Hamp in cultured liver cells; levels of Hamp were reduced after administration of small interfering RNAs against Ppargc 1 a and Creb 3 l 3. PPARGC 1 A and CREB 3 L 3 bound the Hamp promoter to activate its transcription in response to a cyclic adenosine monophosphate analog. Creb 3 l 3 –/– mice did not up-regulate Hamp or become hypoferremic during starvation. ConclusionsWe identified a link between glucose and iron homeostasis, showing that Hepcidin is a gluconeogenic sensor in mice during starvation. This response is involved in hepatic metabolic adaptation to increased energy demands; it preserves tissue iron for vital activities during food withdrawal, but can cause excessive iron retention and hypoferremia in disorders with persistently activated gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance...|$|R
