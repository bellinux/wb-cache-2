50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, the bridge exemplifies the long-span bridge engineering {{of the first}} half of the 20th century. Because of the growing need to provide uninterrupted highway passage over large bodies of water, engineers increasingly were called upon to design large cantilevered trusses, suspension bridges, and steel arches. Innovative <b>erection</b> <b>methods,</b> the availability of very large structural components, and special metals all contributed to the development of long-span bridge technology. For example, nearly a third of the Arrigoni Bridge utilized high-strength silicon steel, and the bridge was almost entirely erected by building the arches outward from the center pier, letting them balance each other as they were extended over the water. Another notable engineering feature are the chains of huge eyebars under the roadway that tie together the ends of each arch; the tied-arch technique resisted the outward horizontal thrust of the arches and thus allowed the piers to be much smaller and more economical.|$|R

40|$|Constructability {{considerations}} are of importance in segmental bridge construction as {{the occurrence of}} failures of bridge superstructures under construction have highlighted. For a safe and economical construction process the interactions between construction loads and the permanent structural system, depending on the chosen <b>erection</b> <b>method,</b> need to be evaluated. Segmental bridges can be constructed with methods like Balanced Cantilever Construction, where individual spans are counterweighted about their substructure support. Time-dependent material properties like strength of the newly cast concrete, as well as shrinkage, creep, and relaxation influence the structural system resistance. Resulting stresses in the unfinished bridge structure during construction can even exceed the final stresses during service. This paper makes an educational contribution by illustrating these concepts with the case study of the Wilson Creek Bridge in Virginia. This five-span cast-in-place bridge was constructed using Balanced Cantilever Construction.

These include presence of large venous channels draining corpora cavernosa, Peyronie's disease, diabetes and structural alterations in fibroblastic components of trabeculae and cavernous smooth muscles. We investigated hypothesis that tunica albuginea atrophy with a resulting subluxation and redundancy effects venous leakage during <b>erection.</b> <b>Methods</b> 18 patients (mean age 33. 6 ± 2. 8 SD years) with venogenic {{erectile dysfunction}} and 17 volunteers for control (mean age 31. 7 ± 2. 2 SD years) were studied. Intracorporal pressure was recorded in all subjects; tunica albuginea biopsies were taken from 18 patients and 9 controls and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains. Results In flaccid phase intracorporal pressure recorded a mean of 11. 8 ± 0. 8 cm H 2 O for control subjects and for patients of 5. 2 ± 0. 6 cm, while during induced erection recorded 98. 4 ± 6. 2 and 5. 9 ± 0. 7 cmH 2 O, respectively. Microscopically, tunica albuginea of controls consisted of circularly-oriented collagen impregnated with elastic fibers. Tunica albuginea of patients showed degenerative and atrophic changes of collagen fibers; elastic fibers were scarce or absent. Conclusion Study has shown that during erection intracorporal pressure of patients with venogenic erectile dysfunction was significantly {{lower than that of}} controls. Tunica albuginea collagen fibers exhibited degenerative and atrophic changes which presumably lead to tunica albuginea subluxation and floppiness. These tunica albuginea changes seem to explain cause of lowered intracorporal pressure which apparently results from loss of tunica albuginea veno-occlusive mechanism.

40|$|Introduction. Understanding the {{physiology}} of penile erection {{is important for}} all {{who work in the}} field of sexual medicine. Aim. The aim {{of this study was to}} highlight and analyze historical aspects of the scientific understanding of penile <b>erection.</b> <b>Methods.</b> (i) Review of the chapters on the {{physiology of}} erection out of the author's collection of books dealing with male sexual functioning published in the German, French, Dutch, and English language in between 1780 and 1940. (ii) Review of the topic "physiology of penile erection" of relevant chapters of Classical writings on erectile dysfunction. An annotated collection of original texts from three millennia, including the study of all relevant references mentioned in these books. Main Outcome Measure. The main outcome measure used for the study was the scientific understanding of the physiology of penile erection. Results. In Antiquity, Galen considered penile erection as the result the accumulation of air. His ideas so dominated medieval medicine that nearly everyone then alive was a Galenist. The beginning of the Renaissance shows meaningful examples of experimental scientific work on the penis. Da Vinci correctly concluded that erections were caused by blood, and in the 18 th century, Von Haller from Switzerland was the first who explained that erections were under the control of the nervous system. In the 19 th century, a mindset that emphasized on experimentation determined a new direction, namely experimental physiology. Animal studies clarified that stimulation of the nervi erigentes-induced small muscle relaxation in the corpora cavernosa. Nearly all were published in the German language. That may be one of the reasons that the existence of the concept of smooth muscle relaxation remained controversial until the first World Congress on Impotence in 1984 in Paris. Conclusions. As the Renaissance's innovative research defined neural and vascular physiologic phenomena responsible for penile erection. The concepts from animal experimentations in Europe in the 19 th century significantly contributed to the current understanding of penile erection...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of the rapid progress of cable-stayed bridges in recent decades is the development of the construction techniques that made their erection possible. Cantilever method and temporary support method are the most common procedures to build such bridges. The temporary support method is the fastest way of building cable-stayed bridges because conventional construction techniques may be used. This fact simplifies the erection task and leads to lower costs. However, when environmental factors or the requirements of the foundations or the sea or river crossing prevent the placement of temporary supports during construction, the cantilever <b>erection</b> <b>method</b> is commonly used. Focus on the research has been mainly devoted to the structural behavior of these structures under construction or service conditions, but the erection procedures and their calculations are not so studied. This paper aims to present practical tools to be used by the designer or the contractor for construction control of the tensioning process of the stays. Namely, a procedure to calculate the stress to be given to the first strand when the strand by strand tensioning technique is used and a procedure to update rationally the tensioning process of a cable stayed bridge when divergence between the foreseen stresses in the stays and the actual ones are noticeable.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a structural modification {{to the conventional}} arch bridge {{and the development of}} a simple, effective <b>erection</b> <b>method</b> for potentially difficult job sites where the working space is limited due to traffic requirement. The modification proposes the use of the straight chord members to approximate a curved arch rib. In construction, each leg-chord member can first be erected vertically with precast units or by cast-in-place at springing in form of columns, with the leg base sitting on a temporarily restrained hinge device at springing. A prefabricated closure-chord using lightweight steel box girder or truss can then be attached to the top of erected leg-chord at an inclined angle with the help of guying towers and lifting cranes to ensure stability during the erection. After the connection of closure-chord to the leg-chord, the twin-leafs on both sides can be rotated from plumb position down to meet at the closure. Completed frame then forms an arch structure that serves as a self-supported system for the concrete placement of the final closure-chord section and the construction of spandrel columns and deck. A detailed comparison of structural characteristics, advantages and disadvantages will be discussed. Additionally, a study including laboratory testing, construction simulation and 3 D finite element analysis for a prototype bridge will be included in the presentation...|$|E
40|$|The {{traffic density}} is growing {{during the last}} decades. As a {{consequence}} numerous new roads and railway lines were built or are planned to be realized in the near future. On the other hand existing bridges must carry the increased traffic. Most of these bridges were not originally designed for the high service loads {{and the amount of}} traffic of today. Many of the structures are aged and, depending on the maintenance and repair carried out, do not longer suit the purpose. Further the demand for increased capacity requires often a deck widening for the carried traffic, or a longer span for traffic underneath. Most situations mentioned finally need the reconstruction of the bridge or replacement of the deck. According to statistics short span bridges are the most frequent category. This paper discusses the potential for composite bridges with short and medium spans for the reconstruction of old bridges, considering the specific requirements resulting from the existing environment and by severe constraints for site work. Via case studies structural systems with hot-rolled beams and appropriate construction methods matching special site restrictions are analysed. In this regard the variety of structural systems and dimensional flexibility is shown, particularly if available construction depth is restricted. The paper is also focused on decreasing the traffic disturbances by using prefabrication and an appropriate <b>erection</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for slim constructions and {{improvement}} of <b>erection</b> <b>methods</b> on building site composite slim-floor systems become more important. In the present european and national codes do not include complete design rules for slim-floor constructions. Therefore {{the objective of this}} thesis is concentrated on the development of design rules for slim-floor girders. During the erection stage the elastic design resistance of the steel girder is decisive. Because of the slight plate thickness and sometimes considerable torsional stressing the influence of the shape deformation becomes more important and has to be considered. In this approach the steel sections are filled with concrete in the final state. Thereby the concrete in the openings, arranged in the web or upper flange, work concurrently as concrete dowels. The determination of moment resistance follows the rules for composite structures, respectively whereas in many cases the strain limited design is relevant and additionally the influences from transverse bending in the bottom flange have to be considered. Because of the sheathing of the concrete encasement by the steel section a hybrid truss model with a compression strut in the concrete section is developed, increasing the shear of the section. In case of fire, the directly flamed bottom flange can be substituted by longitudinal reinforcement bars and a high fire resistance period can be realized without any additional activities. For the analysis in case of fire, a design-method is extracted according to EN 1994 - 1 - 2. Based on a transient analysis, thermal analytic functions are developed to describe the temperature distribution in the cross section. The crack behaviour of the concrete slab has already {{a significant impact on the}} girder deformation in the serviceability limit state. The concrete flange adopts a remarkable part of the bending-moment. Compared to general treatment of common composite girders, the neglecting of these bending influences can lead to unrealistic camber of the girder. Therefore, an approximation procedure is derived that considers the bearing of the resilience of composite connector and the crack behaviour on the structure deformation...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally for Western Europe countries, joints {{in steel}} frame {{structures}} are realised using bolts and welds. In the workshop the components are made using welding and drilling {{of the bolt}} holes. On site these structural components are connected together using bolts and nuts. The actions on site means a large physical effort of the steel construction workers and is not free from danger. Measures {{that need to be}} taken to ease the work and to make it safe for the workers are increasingly expensive. Furthermore the availability of skilled workers who want to do these jobs under variable climatic conditions is decreasing. So the question arises whether there are possibilities to invent so called "plug and play" connections which can be realised using remote control techniques. An extreme example is the connecting device used to dock an space shuttle to a space station. For the average steel structure we are still far away from that situation and we can do with more simple solutions but even those simple plug and play connections are so far only very limited available. Examples of non-traditional types of joints are used in Slim Floor construction. In this type of flooring, the steel beams are integrated into a prefabricated concrete hollow core slab or a deep deck composite slab. The so called plug and play beam to column joints in these mixed structures are characterised by simplicity and fast <b>erection</b> <b>methods.</b> These joints could also be used in traditional steel-concrete composite flooring systems. Most often these joints are only intended to act as a hinge. However, there are some ideas to make plug and play type joints that also can resist some bending moment even in construction stage. As holds for traditional connections also these plug and play joints should resist the forces and moments resulting from all types of loading related {{to the use of the}} structure and resulting from the natural circumstances such as wind and snow. For these type of joints no specific design rules are available in Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8 : 'Steel joints' or chapter 9 of Eurocode 4, Part 1. 1 : 'Composite joints'. The paper describes the basis of design for these joints. Design requirements will be drafted. Some considerations are given to optimise the joint with respect to overall structural behaviour from a technical and economical point of view. The costs of fabrication may slightly be higher than the costs of traditional joints provided that the total costs of fabrication and construction decrease. Fast and safe construction methods with plug and play joints are required for the future...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to design a new MSU which is an improvement of the currently used models. A morphological method which contains all parameters related to the problems is applied to design a final concept. First, multiple concepts are roughly generated, based on the requirements posed by the boundary conditions derived from a literature study. The most potentially suited concepts are selected and roughly analysed against the boundary conditions. On the selected concepts, the folding portal and the <b>erection</b> <b>method</b> of the cable structures are assessed, as the features with the highest potential to affect the erection of the MSU to be designed. These features form the basic concept for further engineering. The MSU has to withstand wind speeds of 20 m/s and 31 m/s. One model is designed in variants for two wind speeds, MSU 20 and MSU 31. Both are largely identical, but differ much in transport requirements and weight. The MSU 20 takes half as much space as the MSU 31. The geometry of the final design shows strong similarities with the currently used MSUs. All are portal structures with a saddle-shaped roof. The main differences between the MSUs are in the structure, assembly, erection, transport requirements and functionality. The main structure is prefabricated and modular, therefore fewer actions are required to assemble the MSU, and also less time. The use of a cable structure allows to assemble and erect the MSU from ground level. This enlarges the deployment range of the MSU to rocky ground as well as unlevelled surfaces. The dimensions of the MSU packages are reduced, making it possible to transport the MSUs transversally in a 20 -ft sea container. At the cross-section, extra channels ensure that add-ons, such as inner-walls, overhangs and shade nets can be fitted. A large part of this study was dedicated to the <b>erection</b> <b>method</b> of the MSU. The final method is determined, but the hand winch should be further optimised and tested to improve its performance.

With concrete slab plus truss system and joints reinforced with concrete and Perfobond Leiste rib, double composite truss bridge {{proved to be}} a fairly suitable solution in negative moment area. Perfobond Leiste shear connector (PBL) is widely implemented in the composite structure for its outstanding fatigue resistance. In this pilot bridge, Perfobond Leister ribs (PBR) were installed in the truss girder's joints, which played double roles as shear connector and stiffener. An <b>erection</b> <b>method</b> and overall bridge structural analysis were then presented. Typical joints in the pilot bridge were selected to analyze the effect of PBR. Investigation of the effect of PBR in concrete-filled tubular joints was elaborated. Comparison has revealed that concrete-filled tubular joints with PBR have much higher constraint capability than joints without PBR. For rectangular tubular truss, the punching shear force of the concrete filled joint with PBR is approximately 43 % larger than that of the joint without PBR. Fatigue performance of the joint installed with PBR was improved, which was found through analysis of the stress concentration factor of joint. The PBR installed in the joints mitigated the stress concentration factor in the chord face. Therefore, the advantages of this new type of bridge are demonstrated, including the convenience of construction using rectangular truss, innovative concept of structural design and better global and local performances...|$|E

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} phenomena effects {{might play}} an important role in the structural behavior of a cable-stayed bridge during construction and in service. In fact, because of these effects the target state of stresses (Objective Service Stage, OSS) can only be achieved at a certain target time. In the literature, a number of software have been presented to study creep and shrinkage effects during cantilever erection of cable-stayed bridges. Nevertheless, the effects of these phenomena in the alternative erection technique, the temporary support <b>erection</b> <b>method,</b> have received little attention. Furthermore, none of the presented software are able to: (1) Define a determined OSS for a given time including the time-dependent phenomena effects and the evolutionary erection of the superstructure. (2) Simulate the construction process assuring the achievement of a given OSS without the need of an overall iterative process taking into account time-dependent phenomena. (3) Provide the prestressing sequence in such a way that no additional tensioning operations are required to correct creep and shrinkage effects in service. To fill all these gaps, a new algorithm, the Forward-Direct Algorithm (FDA), is formally presented in this paper to simulate the construction process of cable-stayed bridges built on temporary supports. The main innovation of this algorithm consists of introducing the time-dependent phenomena effects into the unstressed length of the stays concept to calculate the prestressing strains to be introduced during the last re-tensioning operation. The application of the unstressed length concept has major advantages both in the simulation (as the OSS can be achieved without any overall iterative process) and in service (as re-tensioning operations to correct time-dependent phenomena effects can be avoided). To illustrate the creep and shrinkage effects during the construction and in service the FDA is applied to a real cable-stayed bridge. Furthermore, an analysis to define the optimum time to achieve the OSS is presented. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Investigating {{the ways}} in which barrier methods such as condoms may affect penile sensory {{thresholds}} has potential relevance to the development of interventions in men who experience negative effects of condoms on sexual response and sensation. A quantitative, psychophysiological investigation examining the degree to which sensations are altered by condoms has, to date, not been conducted. Aim. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine penile vibrotactile sensitivity thresholds in both flaccid and erect penises with and without a condom, while comparing men who do and those who do not report condom-associated <b>erection</b> problems (CAEP). <b>Methods.</b> Penile vibrotactile sensitivity thresholds were assessed among a total of 141 young, heterosexual men using biothesiometry. An incremental two-step staircase method was used and repeated three times for each of four conditions. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for all vibratory assessments. Penile vibratory thresholds were compared using a mixed-model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Main Outcome Measures. Penile vibrotactile sensitivity thresholds with and without a condom, erectile function measured by International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire (IIEF), and self-reported degree of erection. Results: Significant main effects of condoms (yes/no) and erection (yes/no) were found. No main or interaction effects of CAEP were found. Condoms were associated with higher penile vibrotactile sensitivity thresholds (F(1, 124) = 17. 11, p<. 001). Penile vibrotactile thresholds were higher with an erect than with a flaccid penis (F(1, 124) = 4. 21, p=. 042). Conclusion: The current study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring penile vibratory thresholds with and without a condom in both erect and flaccid experimental conditions. As might be expected, condoms increased penile vibrotactile sensitivity thresholds. Interestingly, erections were associated with the highest thresholds. Thus, this study was the first to document that erect penises are less sensitive to vibrotactile stimulation than flaccid penises. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Catherine French. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 225 pages, appendices A-H. The camber, or total net upward deflection, of prestressed concrete bridge girders {{is the result}} of the eccentric axial compression force provided by prestressing strands which counteract the deflections due to gravity loads. At the time of strand release, the deflection behavior of prestressed concrete girders is considered to be elastic, and it is common for bridge designers to use elastic camber calculations to predict the camber at release. To estimate the girder camber at bridge <b>erection,</b> a multiplier <b>method</b> is typically used which amplifies the camber at release to roughly account for the time-dependent effects (e. g., creep and shrinkage) that occur between release and erection. Additionally, there are numerous factors which affect the camber at erection and are not known at the time of design, including the girder storage condition in the precasting yard (i. e., bunking) and the age of the girder at erection, that further lead to potential errors in the estimates of the girder camber at erection. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) uses the release camber calculations, based on gross section properties and elastic shortening losses, and a multiplier method to predict the camber at release and erection, respectively. An accurate estimate of camber at erection is important, because if the girders that arrive at a bridge site have cambers that are much lower or much higher than the expected design erection camber, it causes significant problems related to the formation of the bridge deck profile, the composite behavior of the girders and bridge deck, negative or very high stool height requirements, delays in construction and increased costs. It was recently observed that girders were being erected at bridge sites in Minnesota with cambers that were often much lower than predicted. The main side effect of this problem is required stool heights that are too high, especially at midspan. If the required stool heights approach the height of the protruding top flange shear reinforcement, the composite action needed between the girders and the bridge deck cannot be achieved, thus requiring the use of additional reinforcement or changing the entire bridge deck profile, which adds cost and creates delays. To account for this issue, MnDOT switched in late 2007 from the multiplier method recommended by Leslie A. Martin (1977) and PCI (2010), to a universal multiplier of 1. 5. However, the problem persisted and added costs and delays continued to occur. The primary objective of this study was to investigate and determine the cause of low girder camber at both release and bridge erection, which was observed by MnDOT, and to create an improved method for camber prediction, through modified calculations (if necessary) and a new set of multipliers. This objective was achieved through examination of extensive camber records from precasting plants and from in-situ measurements during erection of Minnesota I-girders, instrumentation and camber monitoring of fourteen girders from release to erection, concrete material testing, an analysis of prestress losses due to thermal effects, and PBEAM time-dependent camber modeling to investigate various effects including creep and shrinkage, girder support conditions during storage and age at erection. Extensive historical fabrication data was collected from two precasting plants (referred to as Plant A and B) for 1067 girders produced between 2006 and 2010. Camber at erection data was collected from the counties for 768 of those girders. On average, it was found that the measured camber at release for those 1067 girders was only 74 % of the design value. Furthermore, it was found that the measured camber at erection for the 768 girders was only 83. 5 %, on average, of the design value; and that girders erected at early ages almost always had cambers that were significantly lower than the design value. Because the predicted camber at erection is obtained by amplifying the elastic camber at release, inaccurate estimates of the camber at release can compound the problems of estimating the camber at erection. Various factors that affect the release camber were investigated, including concrete strength and modulus of elasticity, and variation in the strand prestress force. It was found that the increased concrete strengths achieved at the precasting plants (15. 5 % over the specified design value, on average) decrease camber due to the increased elastic modulus. Multiple concrete cylinder samples from both precasting plants were tested to investigate the concrete strength and elastic modulus over time. It was found that the ACI 363 R- 10 expression used by MnDOT to estimate the concrete modulus of elasticity from the specified concrete compressive strength greatly underestimates the elastic modulus of concrete produced at both precasting plants. The Pauw (ACI 318 - 08, AASHTO LRFD 2010) equation was determined to be the best predictor of the concrete elastic modulus, and when used to recalculate the release camber predictions for the 1067 historical girders, yielded significantly more accurate results. A thermal effects analysis was conducted to determine the effect of concrete and ambient temperatures on the strand stress at release. It was found that the combined thermal effects (and strand relaxation) cause a reduction in strand stress at release of approximately 3 %, on average. The position of each girder in the bed was also found to cause variations in prestress force through the redistribution of draped strand stress due to the harping sequence (at Plant A) and friction losses (at Plant B). Finally, it was found that high strand density, though often found in long MN-shape girders which had slightly lower release cambers, was not a major cause of reduced release camber. Thus, it was determined that the major causes for the discrepancy in release camber predictions and observed cambers were the increased concrete release strengths, the fact that the ACI 363 equation for concrete elastic modulus underestimated the measured elastic moduli, and strand prestress losses due to thermal effects. The effects of these primary factors were considered in re-predicting the cambers of a select data set for which detailed fabrication data, including curing and temperature records, were known. The girders included in this data set were those from which the concrete material samples were obtained, the instrumented girders, and selected girders from the historical data set. It was found that the accuracy of the re-predicted cambers was much greater than the original design cambers, and that the amount of variability in the results was reduced. Recommendations for modified camber calculations were made based on average effects (i. e., 15. 5 % release concrete strength increase, the Pauw equation for estimating concrete elastic modulus, and thermal prestress losses of 3 %). These recommendations were then tested against the entire historical girder database, and it was found that the discrepancy between measured and design camber values improved from approximately 74 % to 99 %, on average. This result confirmed that the revised release camber calculations provided much more accurate camber predictions than the original design equations. It should be noted that the overall scatter was not reduced because the recommendations were implemented in an average sense to all 1067 girders in the historical database. Once the discrepancy between measured and design release camber values was determined, various factors that affect long-term and erection camber were investigated, including solar radiation, relative humidity, concrete creep and shrinkage, length of cure and bunking/storage conditions. The program PBEAM was also validated for use in release and long-term camber modeling. It was found that solar radiation affects the measurement of camber by as much as 15 % during the course of a day, emphasizing that camber is a constantly fluctuating value. Relative humidity was found to cause changes in concrete creep and shrinkage and induce camber variability. High relative humidity during the winter months was also observed to cause slight increases in camber. Through PBEAM validation, it was found that the ACI 209 R- 92 concrete creep and shrinkage models provided the best results for long-term camber predictions and that the Mokhtarzadeh ACI 209 variation models provided a consistent lower bound. As such, the ACI 209 R- 92 creep and shrinkage models were used in the time-dependent camber modeling predictions. Weekend curing was found to cause lower erection cambers than weekday-cured girders, even though the camber discrepancy at release was less evident, due to additional stress recovery from cooler curing conditions. Finally, it was found that bunking/storage conditions led to increased cambers, additional camber variability, and possible exceedance of codified stress limits. Bunking limitations were recommended in order to limit these undesirable effects. These observations and results were used to create PBEAM inputs and ensuing long-term camber predictions for girders of varying depth and length. From these results, four “sets” of multipliers were created by comparing the long-term camber predictions to the current MnDOT and improved release camber predictions. Two of the sets of multipliers were developed to be applied to the MnDOT approach to predict release camber, and the other two were developed to be applied to the improved release camber predictions. For each approach, one set was based on a single multiplier to best predict erection camber and the other set recommended four different multipliers that reflected approximate age ranges for the girders at erection. These four different sets of multipliers were then applied to the historical girder data set and compared to the measured erection camber data. It was found that all four sets of multipliers greatly improved the erection camber predictions, with average measured vs. adjusted design erection camber percent values of 95. 6 %- 97. 1 %. However, only the “time-dependent” multipliers, which accounted for four potential ranges in girder age at erection, reduced the amount of scatter in the results. In particular, these multipliers alleviated the problem of over-predicted erection cambers for girders erected at early ages. Both the improved release camber predictions and the “Improved Time-Dependent” multipliers are recommended to be used by MnDOT for future camber predictions. In addition to the recommendations for the modified camber calculations at release and the new set of multipliers, recommendations for girder fabrication were also created to reduce camber variability and improve girder production at the precasting plants. Included in these recommendations are limitations for bunking/storage conditions and a spreadsheet created to produce more accurate temperature corrections (for Plants A and B). It was found that the amount of camber variability that can be expected using the recommended calculations and multipliers is approximately ± 15 %, or even lower if the girder fabrication recommendations are put into practice...|$|R
