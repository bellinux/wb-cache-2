50|$|Standardized NEMA & IEC {{motor frame}} sizes {{throughout}} the industry result in interchangeable dimensions for shaft, <b>foot</b> <b>mounting,</b> general aspects {{as well as}} certain motor flange aspect. Since an open, drip proof (ODP) motor design allows a free air exchange from outside to the inner stator windings, this style of motor tends to be slightly more efficient because the windings are cooler. A lower speed requires a larger frame.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{describe}} a data collection methodology and reference data set {{that can be}} used by the indoor navigation community to verify and improve algorithms based on <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> inertial sensors. The data set is collected using a high precision optical reference system that is traditionally used in the film industry for human motion capturing or in specialist applications such as analysis of human motion in sports and medical rehabilitation. The data provides synchronous 6 degrees of freedom inertial measurement sensor readings from a <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> MEMS sensor array as well as the high resolution data from the optical tracking system providing location and orientation ground truth. We will also provide the results of algorithms that identify the rest phase during the human gait cycle which {{is an essential part of}} pedestrian dead reckoning systems for positioning...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{particle}} filter design combines <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> inertial (IMU), {{bluetooth low energy}} (BLE) and ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies along with map matching into a seamless integrated navigation system for indoors. The system was evaluated by 10 test walks along an 80 m long indoor track including stairs and running. 95 % {{of the time the}} average error for a particle was below 3. 1 m with filter completion success rate of 90 %. Furthermore, a system without UWB using only IMU, BLE and map matching achieved an average error for a particle to be below 3. 6 m with filter completion success rate of 70 %. The selected technologies and sensors are affordable and easily deployable. Inertial measurement unit's characteristics complement the disadvantages in the rf technologies and vice versa. The code for the rover can be implemented on a modern mobile device together with a <b>foot</b> <b>mounted</b> IMU...|$|R
