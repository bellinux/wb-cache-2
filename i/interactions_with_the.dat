5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light. It was likely formed by {{collisions}} within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|All serpins share {{a common}} {{structure}} (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three β-sheets (named A, B and C) and eight or nine α-helices (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive centre loop (RCL). The A-sheet includes two β-strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the 'shutter', and upper region called the 'breach'. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins {{are thought to be}} in dynamic equilibrium between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the structure, and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.|$|E

5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

With the end of Uruk culture c 3000 BC, Tell Brak's Urukean colony was abandoned and deliberately leveled by its occupants. Tell Brak contracted during the following periods H and J, and became limited to the mound. Evidence exists for an interaction with the Mesopotamian south during period H, represented by the existence of materials similar to the ones produced during the southern Jemdet Nasr period. The city remained a small settlement during the Ninevite 5 period, with a small temple and associated sealing activities.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, flying aboard Atlantis was the GPP payload which {{consisted}} of two experiments – the GPP experiment and the Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE). The payload was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center's Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth's thermosphere, ionosphere and mesosphere energetics and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere by observing shuttle and Mir glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – {{sometimes in the}} form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E

5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto {{with any degree of}} accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet.
