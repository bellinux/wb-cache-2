"In {{your part}} of the country, gentlemen, that which we should {{naturally}} appeal to as the friend of order and stability--property--is blindly against us; prejudice is also against us; and we have nothing left to which we can appeal but human nature and the common privilege of manhood. You seem to have entertained some hope that I would gather about myself a 'President's party,' which should be more friendly to you and those animosities which you mistake for interests. But you grossly deceive yourselves; I have nor sympathy but with my whole country, {{and there is nothing}} out of which such a party as you dream of could be constructed, except the broken remnant of those who deserted you when for the first time you needed their help and not their subserviency, and those feathery characters who are drawn hither and thither by the chances of office. I need not say to you that I am and can be nothing in this matter but the voice of the nation's deliberate resolve. The recent past is too painful, the immediate future too momentous, to tolerate any personal considerations. You throw yourselves upon our magnanimity, and I must be frank with you. My predecessor, Mr. Buchanan, taught us the impolicy of weakness and concession. The people are magnanimous, but they understand by magnanimity a courageous steadiness in principle. They do not think it possible that a large heart should consist with a narrow brain; and they would consider it pusillanimous in them to consent to the weakness of their country by admitting you to a share in its government before you have given evidence of sincere loyalty to its principles, or, at least, of wholesome fear of its power. They believe, and I heartily agree with them, that a strong nation begets strong citizens, and a weak one weak,--that the powers of the private man are invigorated and enlarged by his confidence {{in the power of the}} body politic; and they see no possible means of attaining or securing this needed strength but in that homogeneousness of laws and institutions which breeds unanimity of ideas and sentiments, no way of arriving at that homogeneousness but the straightforward path of perfect confidence in freedom. All nations have a right to security, ours to greatness; and must have the one as an essential preliminary to the other. If your prejudices stand in the way, and you are too weak to rid yourselves of them, it will be <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> consider whether the plain duty of conquering them for you will be, after all, so difficult a conquest as some they have already achieved. By yourselves or us they must be conquered. Gentlemen, in bidding you farewell, I ask you to consider whether you have not forgotten that, in order to men's living peacefully together in communities, the idea of government must precede that of liberty, and that the one is as much the child of necessity as the other is a slow concession to civilization, which itself mainly consists in the habit of obedience to something more refined than force." ...|$|E

5000|$|Harding's {{opponent}} in the 1920 election was Ohio governor and newspaperman James M. Cox, who had won the Democratic nomination in a 44-ballot convention battle. His running mate was Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Harding rejected the [...] "progressive" [...] ideology of the Wilson administration {{in favor of the}} [...] "laissez-faire" [...] approach of the McKinley administration. He ran on a promise to restore the nation's pre-World War I stride, and, through his use of the phrase [...] "Return to normalcy", {{called for an end to}} the abnormal era of the preceding eight years - an era which he saw as tainted by war, internationalism, and government activism. [...] In envisioning the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> regain that former stride in the new decade, he stated: [...] America's present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but the dispassionate; not experiment, but equipoise; not submergence in internationality, but sustainment in triumphant nationality.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Spencer Ackerman of the Washington Independent in 2008, Kilcullen called the decision to invade Iraq [...] "fucking stupid" [...] and suggested that if policy-makers apply his manual's lessons, similar wars can be avoided in the future. [...] "The biggest stupid idea," [...] Kilcullen said, [...] "was to invade Iraq in the first place." [...] Kilcullen didn't deny saying it, but rather that [...] "I can categorically state that the word ‘fucking’ was said off the record". Kilcullen explained his comment the next day: In my view, the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 was an extremely serious strategic error. But {{the task of the}} moment is not to cry over spilt milk, rather to help clean it up: a task in which the surge, the comprehensive counterinsurgency approach, and our troops on the ground are admirably succeeding. ... The question of whether we were right to invade Iraq is a fascinating debate for historians and politicians, and a valid issue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> consider in an election year. As it happens, I think it was a mistake. But that is not my key concern. The issue for practitioners in the field is not to second-guess a decision from six years ago, but {{to get on with the}} job at hand which, I believe, is what both Americans and Iraqis expect of us. In that respect, the new strategy and tactics implemented in 2007, and which relied for their effectiveness on the extra troop numbers of the Surge, ARE succeeding and need to be supported.|$|E
5000|$|Cartoons with Japanese {{stereotypes}} {{made little}} effort to develop a Japanese character or explain what Japan hoped to accomplish from the war, they remained nameless. The Japanese enemies were freakish stereotypes but were more often showcased as idiots rather than actual threats, {{this may have been}} done to dehumanize them as this would make it easier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> hate and kill them. When the Bureau of Motion Pictures heard of these portrayals of the Japanese they were not pleased and decided to get all studios to shift from the theme of racism to one of fascism. Of course, however, the US Government issued statements that the enemy was not the German, Italian or Japanese themselves but it was their leadership that America should despise. [...] This went unnoticed as even Japanese Americans were being rounded up and put into internment camps in Washington, Oregon and California as it was thought they could join the enemy at any time, or commit acts of sabotage or espionage. An article in Time magazine even suggested how the American people could tell the difference between Asian people saying ‘the Japanese walk stiffly erect, hard heeled’ while the Chinese were more relaxed and had an ‘easy gait’. [...] These factors reinforced the idea that the Japanese were a unified mass even if some of them lived in America. By 1944, a poll suggested that 13% of Americans wanted to kill all Japanese and by 1945, 22% were disappointed that more atomic bombs were not used on the Japanese after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This shows that years of anti-Japanese propaganda and racial prejudices was starting to {{have an effect on the}} American population.|$|E
40|$|Constitutional {{theory is}} widely {{regarded}} by scholars {{as one of the}} great disasters in contemporary legal thought. None of the popular theories is seen as finally workable, all are contingent and internally chaotic, and the courts that must do the serious work of interpreting the Constitution show no serious interest in any of them. The ever-messier business of nominating and confirming Justices to serve on the Supreme Court is, in its way, contributing to the chaos, and things were spiraling downward well before the Senate 2 ̆ 7 s decisive rejection of the nomination of Robert Bork. The Senate, unable to agree on the precise role that it should play in the selection process, now finds itself trapped between the notion that it should act to enforce a set of professional standards, reviewing nominees only to ensure that they possess proper qualifications, and the idea that it should inquire deeply into the substantive judicial philosophy of each nominee, to keep from the Court those whose constitutional visions are too extreme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> stomach. Neither of these roles is a useful one for the Senate to play—the one because it trivializes the process, the other because it trivializes the Constitution. There is higher ground, however, and this is a small story about how the Senate might get there...|$|E

40|$|Supreme Court {{confirmation}} hearings provide {{a rare opportunity}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> hear what (would-be) justices think {{about the nature of}} judging {{and the role of the}} Supreme Court. In recent years, nominees have been quick to talk about judging in terms of neutrality and objectivity, most famously with Chief Justice Roberts’ invocation of the “neutral umpire,” and they have emphasized their reliance on legal texts and sources as if those sources can provide answers in difficult cases. Many of the cases heard by the Supreme Court, however, do not have objectively correct answers that can be deduced from the legal materials. Instead the justices must bring judgment to bear, and that judgment inevitably incorporates subjectivity and reference to values and principles not explicit in the legal sources. This Article considers the extent to which nominees admit to such subjectivity and the extent to which they claim neutrality or objectivity, looking at all {{confirmation hearings}} since 1955. Through coding the nominees’ testimony, the Article identifies some of the circumstances under which these claims and admissions are most likely to be made. Among other findings, the Article reports that Democratic and Republican nominees are equally likely to claim neutrality in colloquy with any particular senator. On the other hand, Democratic nominees are about twice as likely as Republican nominees to admit to a role for subjectivity. Drawing on the insights of cultural cognition scholars, the Article then considers the implications of such findings and raises potential concerns for public perceptions of the Court, especially in light of our current highly polarized political culture...|$|E
40|$|This study {{starts from}} {{the sense of}} admiration on the {{struggle}} {{of the people of}} the United States to survive from the Great Depression suffered by the nation in the 1920 s. It turns out that one of the reasons the Americans could immediately disengage from the turmoil is because they have the concept of American Dream that is deeply rooted among its people. Such a concept and the experience have been stated in literary works, one of which is John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. Therefore, it is not exaggerated if the concept of American Dream contained in the work is further analyzed. The objectives of this study are to reveal the American Dream shown in the novel as well as to find out about the concept of American Dream as seen in the characters of the story. In conducting this study, the writer uses a socio-historical approach considering that the novel describes the life of the American people in the 1920 s and that the concept of American Dream is believed to exist far before the United States of America established. Socio-historical approach is an approach which takes accounts the social and historical background according to authors’ perspectives that become the foundation of creating literary works. The analyses show that in the era of the Great Depression, the concept of American Dream becomes the guidelines <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> survive. The novel describes that each individual has his/her own dreams as the dream of freedom kept by George, Candy, Curley’s wife and Crooks; the dream of work and wealth kept by George, Lennie and Candy; the dream of happiness kept by Candy, Curley’s wife and Lennie; as well as the dream of fame and the dream of family kept by George, Lennie, Candy and Crooks. The reactions of every character in the story toward their life and dreams prove that American Dream is not merely a hope for the better future, but it requires great efforts to achieve it...|$|E
40|$|American {{television}} and radio broadcasters are uniquely privileged among Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensees. Exalted as public trustees by the 1934 Communications Act, broadcasters pay virtually nothing {{for the use of}} their channels of public radiofrequency spectrum, unlike many other FCC licensees who have paid billions of dollars for similar digital spectrum. Congress envisioned a social contract of sorts between broadcast licensees and the communities they served. In exchange for their free licenses, broadcast stations were charged with providing a platform for a free marketplace of ideas that would cultivate a democratically engaged and enlightened citizenry through the broadcasting of public interest programming. Few, other than the broadcasters themselves, would dispute that this public trustee doctrine has been a dismal failure. In exchange for the {{tens of billions of dollars}} of advertising revenue generated by their licenses, commercial {{television and}} radio broadcasters air very little - and some air none - of the kinds of locally oriented public affairs, political, educational, and cultural programming traditionally considered public interest fare. Congress and the FCC have failed to correct the mismatch between the proven profit-making power of public trusteeship and its anemic returns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> <b>To</b> the contrary, Congress and the FCC, captured by the broadcast industry they regulate, have continued to subsidize commercial broadcasters constructively by awarding them new lucrative digital channels at no cost to them, while lifting ownership concentration limits and eliminating or failing to enforce the few remaining public interest programming requirements. This Article begins by surveying the history of the public trustee doctrine, its First Amendment contradictions, and the legislative and regulatory failures and frustrations that have bedeviled the pursuit of a 2 ̆ 2 free marketplace of ideas 2 ̆ 2 on the nation 2 ̆ 7 s airwaves. It then explores the First Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s public forum doctrine as an alternative justification for government regulation of the public spectrum, reasoning in favor of the government 2 ̆ 7 s proactive creation and maintenance of public speech fora. After examining the Internet both as a public forum and as the sort of free marketplace of ideas that the broadcast spectrum was expected - but failed - to create, this Article argues that an affirmative public forum doctrine supports a requirement that broadcasters subsidize broadband Internet access in low-income and underserved communities...|$|E
