5|$|In a 1982 {{interview}} with Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Henson said ideas for his feature film The Dark Crystal originated from his efforts at character creation on Saturday Night Live. Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the evolutionary process from The Land of Gorch to Dark Crystal, saying that because The Land of Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of his puppets, including risqué behavior. He described {{the challenge that}} motivated him to further develop concepts from The Land of Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next motivation was to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and {{a high degree of}} contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E
5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, any {{research}} that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts {{could be considered}} legal psychology (although research involving clinical psychology, e.g., mental illness, competency, insanity defense, offender profiling, etc., is typically categorized as forensic psychology, and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of Law and Human Behavior, the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of their research {{and move on to}} other areas.|$|E

The agency, however, has nearly doubled in size since then and also assumed additional responsibilities from various intelligence elements from across the Department of Defense, CIA and wider intelligence community. In 2006, at the height of Donald Rumsfeld's push to further <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of military intelligence beyond tactical considerations, DIA was estimated to receive up to $3 billion annually.|$|E
25|$|A trial, which officially {{concerned}} the massacre at Portella della Ginestra convened at Viterbo, Lazio on 12 June 1950, but was quickly adjourned and reconvened in 1951.

There were thirty six defendants, all with attorneys, many of whom wanted to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the trial to embarrass the conservative government. All of the defendants except Pisciotta denied even being present at the May Day event. Pisciotta named many of the names previously cited, but also included Mario Scelba, Minister of the Interior. His revelations often occurred during barely coherent outburts—his behavior indicated {{a man in the}} grip of fear and uncertainty. On 11 May 1951, he admitted murdering Giuliano.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} and co-programmed by Volker Wertich, creator of the original Settlers game. Having consulted fan feedback from the first two games, Wertich wanted to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the third installment as much as possible, whilst preserving the elements which made the series unique. In light of this design principal, although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly {{the same as in}} previous titles, many of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, combat is more involved, with the player given direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, as all settlers can now walk freely around the player's territory; headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, instead the player must build residences to gain new settlers; and the different races are no longer merely aesthetically differentiated, they now have different economic models, different magic spells, different war machines, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer, the addition of which {{had been one of the}} main requests from fans.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Swedish parliament, Riksdagen, due to the secrecy issues raised during the trial that granted the two private individuals access to sensitive personal data. This bill did not pass, but in 2004, a new act on ethical review of research involving humans was introduced. Changes were put in place in order to strengthen the protection for human subjects participating in medical research and to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the ethical councils, while bringing the Swedish legislation closer to the European Commission directive. The official act governing medical research was further adjusted in 2008: ethical review is now legally required in Sweden, the review committees have official status, and consent can be withdrawn by participants in medical research at any point. However, voices in the medical research community have raised concerns about law revisions' lack of attention to additional safeguards for researchers falsely accused of scientific misconduct and are calling for procedures that would ensure that scientific misconduct investigations are handled in a correct and legally secure manner.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable effects of the {{adoption}} of the Charter was to greatly <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. The Charter, however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the United Kingdom, was based upon Parliamentary supremacy. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power. The Charter only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.|$|E

500|$|Following s {{success in}} 2003, {{the cast and}} crew signed on for two sequels to be shot back-to-back.

Inspired by the real-life confederation of pirates, Elliott and Rossio looked at historical figures and created fictional characters from them to <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> beyond the main cast.
