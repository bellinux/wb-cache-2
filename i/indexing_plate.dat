5000|$|Direct {{indexing}} plate: Most dividing heads have an <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> permanently {{attached to}} the spindle. This plate {{is located at the}} end of the spindle, very close to where the work would be mounted. It is fixed to the spindle and rotates with it. This plate is usually equipped with a series of holes that enables rapid indexing to common angles, such as 30, 45, or 90 degrees. A pin in the base of the dividing head can be extended into the direct <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> to lock the head quickly into one of these angles. [...] The advantage of the direct <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> is that it is fast and simple and no calculations are required to use it. The disadvantage is that it can only be used for a limited number of angles.|$|E
5000|$|Interchangeable {{indexing}} {{plates are}} used {{when the work}} must be rotated to an angle not available on the direct <b>indexing</b> <b>plate.</b> Because the hand crank is fixed to the spindle at a known ratio (commonly 40:1) the dividing plates mounted at the handwheel {{can be used to}} create finer divisions for precise orientation at arbitrary angles. These dividing plates are provided in sets of several plates. Each plate has rings of holes with different divisions. For example, an <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> might have three rows of holes with 24, 30, and 36 holes in each row. A pin on the hand crank engages these holes. Index plates with up to 400 holes are available. [...] Only one such plate can be mounted to the dividing head at a time. The plate is selected by the machinist based on exactly what angle he wishes to index to.|$|E

50|$|A {{rotary table}} is a {{precision}} work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of <b>index</b> <b>plates</b> for <b>indexing</b> operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which <b>indexing</b> <b>plates</b> are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (indexing head).|$|R

50|$|For example, if a {{machinist}} {{wanted to}} index (rotate) his workpiece by 22.5 degrees {{then he would}} turn the hand crank two full revolutions plus one-half of a turn. Since each full revolution is 9 degrees and a half-revolution is 4.5 degrees, the total is 22.5 (9 + 9 + 4.5 = 22.5). The one-half turn can easily be done precisely using any <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> with an even number of holes and rotating to the halfway point (Hole #8 on the 16-hole ring).|$|E
50|$|To machine a {{helical gear}} on a manual machine, a true {{indexing}} fixture must be used. Indexing fixtures can disengage the drive worm, and be attached via an external gear train {{to the machine}} table's handle (like a power feed). It then operates similarly to a carriage on a lathe. As the table moves on the X axis, the fixture will rotate in a fixed ratio with the table. The indexing fixture itself receives {{its name from the}} original purpose of the tool: moving the table in precise, fixed increments. If the indexing worm is not disengaged from the table, one can move the table in a highly controlled fashion via the <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> to produce linear movement of great precision (such as a vernier scale).|$|E
50|$|CNC {{indexing}} heads may {{be controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the dividing head. It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the indexing head and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual indexing head because {{there is no need to}} interchange indexing plates or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the <b>indexing</b> <b>plate.</b> A CNC dividing head may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Worm cam {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} indexing mechanism which is widely used in automatic machinery. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the mechanism has high demands on the cylinder cam. The machining methods of cylinder cam are unique and the methods of special machine tool and NC machining are the two methods that general adopted in the machining of it. In this paper, the method of CNC Programming which is used for machining cylinder cam in 5 -axeses high speed DMU 70 eVolution Machining Center is introduced. The machining principle of cylinder cam has been studied, and the mathematical model for CNC Programming has also been worked out. The automated compensation of cutting tool’s radius is used in this field for the first time. Worm {{cam mechanism}} Cylinder cam mechanism is widely used in automatic machinery. Fig. 1 shows one kind of cylinder cam mechanism. When the camshaft rotates, the groove and the convex ridge in the cam make the rollers revolve round {{the center of the}} <b>indexing</b> <b>plate,</b> so the cyclical movement of <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> is realized. This mechanism is mainly used in the occasions of more indexing workstations, larger load and lower speed. The speed and acceleration rules of its cam follower can be chosen according to the predetermined motion demands, and then realize the precise transmission. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the special and complex shape, the machining methods of this mechanism are unique. The common machining methods of worm cam have the following two: The method of special machine tool: Because the indexing curves of cam have a high transmission precision requirement and complex shape, and also, they are space curved face, so we could take advantage of copying machine to machine the cam curves by model or use the special machine tool to machine them...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the angular {{alignment}} tolerance for Brewsters angle plates is not generally strict. It is often not appreciated that for high <b>index</b> <b>plates</b> however wedge tolerances are small. It is shown that in Brewster angle plates of high refractive index materials, small wedge angles in the fabricated plate can cause internal s-plane reflections to become trapped by total internal reflection. A wedge angle acceptable in terms of its p-plane loss can cause such trapped reflections. In laser systems the resulting multiply reflected beams can move sideways in the plate and eventually hit o-ring seals or other mounting arrangements, causing component damage and leaks in unexpected locations. Stray light problems of an unexpected nature can occur from this effect in both laser based and conventional optical devices...|$|R
