40|$|Implementation of <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> {{mechanisms}} in the contractual arrangements of a construction project can impact significantly on {{the motivation of}} contractors and hence project performance. Positive incentives (as {{a component of the}} project delivery strategy) aim to motivate contractors to align their goals with those of the client, via a <b>financial</b> reward. These <b>incentive</b> mechanisms take many forms in construction contracts, including: profit sharing in cost plus incentive contracts, bonus performance provisions attached to various lump sum and cost reimbursable contracts, and multiple <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> mixes. The optimisation of <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> mechanisms depends greatly on how they are designed in the context of specific project environments. For example, if the client/contractor relationship is poor, the contractor may perceive the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> as calculative and hostile, and therefore will be less committed to the client’s goals than the incentives intended. In order to establish a starting point for further research into this topic area, this paper outlines the results of an international review of the literature on <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> contract types and the factors that influence the motivation of contract agents under these arrangements. The paper then goes on to propose an analytical framework that is {{to be used in the}} evaluation of optimal <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> {{mechanisms in}} construction projects, drawing on economic and psychological motivational theories. The findings of this review provide a sound basis for the empirical work to follow in a PhD project investigating the optimisation of <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> mechanisms in the Australian commercial building industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> programs, which have become an {{increasingly}} common component of welfare programs. We review experimental evidence from several such programs. <b>Financial</b> <b>incentive</b> programs appear to increase work and raise income (lower poverty), but cost somewhat more than alternative welfare programs. In particular, windfall beneficiaries [...] those {{who would have been}} working anyway [...] can raise costs by participating in the program. Several existing programs limit this effect by targeting long-term welfare recipients or by limiting benefits to full-time workers. At the same time, because <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> programs transfer support to working low-income families, the increase in costs due to windfall beneficiaries makes these programs more effective at alleviating poverty and raising incomes. Evidence also indicates that combining <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> programs with job search and job support services can increase both employment and income gains. Non-experimental evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and from state Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) programs with enhanced earnings disregards also suggests that these programs increase employment, and this evidence is consistent with the experimental evidence on {{the impact of}} <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> program. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Financial</b> <b>incentive</b> {{interventions}} {{have been}} suggested as one method of promoting healthy behaviour change. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> interventions for encouraging healthy behaviour change; to explore whether effects vary according to the type of behaviour incentivised, post-intervention follow-up time, or incentive value. Data Sources: Searches were of relevant electronic databases, research registers, www. google. com, and the reference lists of previous reviews; and requests for information sent to relevant mailing lists. Eligibility Criteria: Controlled evaluations of the effectiveness of <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> interventions, compared to no intervention or usual care, to encourage healthy behaviour change, in non-clinical adult populations, living in high-income countries, were included. Study Appraisal and Synthesis: The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess all included studies.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of aeronautical accidents highlights {{the fact that}} some airline pilots demonstrate a trend to land whereas the approach is not well stabilized. This behavior seems to be the consequence of various factors, including financial issues. Our hypothesis is that financial constraints modulate the brain circuitry of emotion and reward, in particular via the interactions between two prefrontal structures: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(DLPFC), main center of the executive functions (EFs), high level cognitive abilities, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), structure linked with the limbic system, major substratum of emotional processes. In our experiment, participants performed a simplified task of landing in which the level of uncertainty and the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> were manipulated. A preliminary behavioral experiment (n = 12) was conducted. A similar second experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is in progress and a case study only is reported here. The behavioral data showed that the participants made more risky decision to land in the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> condition in comparison to the neutral condition, where no <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> was delivered. This was particularly true when the uncertainty was high. The functional neuroimaging results showed that the reasoning performed in neutral condition resulted in enhanced activity in DLPFC. On the contrary, {{under the influence of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>incentive,</b> VMPFC activity was increased. These results showed the effectiveness of the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> to bias decision-making toward a more risky and less rational behavior from a safety point of view. Functional neuroimaging data showed a shift from cold to hot reasoning in presence of the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive,</b> suggesting that pilot erroneous trend to land could be explained by a temporary perturbation of the decision-making process due to the negative emotional consequences associated with the go-around...|$|R

Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E
40|$|Whether or not <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes help organisations {{to reach}} their {{objectives}} is an old debate. During the last few decades, the modern management schools -Total Quality Management (TQM) and new manufacturing techniques-added extra pressure on <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes by claiming that such schemes don't fit in a modern management environment {{and that they can}} have a destructive influence on organisations. Although the advocates of TQM and modern manufacturing management techniques have different views concerning <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes, generally speaking, they don't believe that these schemes help modern organisations {{to reach their}} objectives. Some of these advocates see that <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes motivate employees to focus on quantity and ignore quality. Others see that although those schemes can help to achieve progress, that progress is {{at the expense of the}} intrinsic rewards that organisations should promote. Other TQM advocates believe that these schemes do not help because effective and efficient systems rather than individuals are the main factor that determines the progress of organisations. This category believes that it makes more sense to improve the systems and procedures rather than to use <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes to motivate employees to reach the organisations' targets. The purpose of this research project was to answer the question as to whether a compromise between TQM and <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes could be achieved to make the best use of both approaches. To answer this question an organisation with a strong TQM environment was identified and a <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> scheme was designed and implemented in that organisation with the help of a design team from the same organisation. The scheme covered five main areas of interest to the organisation namely: product and process quality, manufacturing management, environmental compliance, safety compliance and cost effectiveness. From several key performance indicators (KPIs) used by the organisation in these five areas only those under the direct control of employees were used in this research project. Samples of employees from the departments covered by the incentive scheme were consulted all through the different stages of the development of the incentive scheme. A comprehensive communication plan was undertaken to ensure that the structure and principles of the incentive scheme were clearly communicated to all employees. The results of installing the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> scheme were then analysed to study the effect of implementing that scheme on the organisational performance and on the TQM environment and particularly on some specific TQM attributes. The analysis of those results showed that the incentive scheme achieved a considerable improvement in almost all of the areas covered by the scheme. The analysis showed no evidence of any adverse effect on the TQM environment as a result of installing the incentive scheme. In fact it was concluded that the TQM environment assisted the implementation of the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> scheme...|$|R
