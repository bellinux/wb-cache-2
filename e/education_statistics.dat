5000|$|Statistics is both {{a formal}} science and a {{practical}} theory of scientific inquiry, and both aspects are considered in <b>statistics</b> <b>education.</b> <b>Education</b> in <b>statistics</b> has similar concerns as does education in other mathematical sciences, like logic, mathematics, and computer science. At the same time, statistics is concerned with evidence-based reasoning, particularly with the analysis of data. Therefore, <b>education</b> in <b>statistics</b> has strong similarities to education in empirical disciplines like psychology and chemistry, in which education is closely tied to [...] "hands-on" [...] experimentation.|$|R

40|$|The {{history and}} current nature of {{research}} in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> are outlined and some suggestions for its future direction are made. It is claimed that research in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> is a research discipline in its own right. RESEARCH IN <b>STATISTICS</b> <b>EDUCATION</b> It is sometimes said that research in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> is not really statistics, and an unstated implication {{of this is that}} it is not really the concern of academic statisticians. Indeed some statisticians are reluctant to recognize <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> as a field of academic research and its publication is not rated as highly as that of statistical research. On the other hand, although statisticians who are active in this field might find that they are honorary members of education departments when research assessment exercises are carried out, it is doubtful whether they would be accepted as full members of an education department unless they also have a qualification in education. The reverse of this is that those whose main discipline is education but who are interested in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> research are not necessarily accepted as members of a statistics department. It is therefore timely to define research in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> and to proclaim its existence as a researc...|$|R
40|$|<b>Statistics</b> <b>education</b> in {{psychology}} often falls disappointingly short of its goals. The {{increasing use of}} qualitative approaches in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> research has extended and enriched our understanding of statistical cognition processes, and thus facilitated improvements in statistical education and practices. Yet conceptual analysis, a fundamental part of the scientific method and arguably the primary qualitative method insofar as it is logically prior and equally applicable to all other empirical research methods—quantitative, qualitative, and mixed—has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present the case for this approach, and then report results from a conceptual analysis of <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> {{in psychology}}. The results highlight {{a number of major}} problems that have received little attention in standard <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> research...|$|R

40|$|Student {{numbers in}} <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> {{programs}} have increased rapidly {{during the past}} two decades. This is the case in developed as well as developing countries.

Furthermore, application of information and communication technologies in <b>statistics</b> <b>education</b> has provided the opportunity for providing statistical education programs through open and distance education.
