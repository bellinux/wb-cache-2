5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which {{contained}} ideas about reforming society and struggling <b>for</b> <b>truth,</b> and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred {{critique of the}} political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct. Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive <b>for</b> <b>truth,</b> it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982. Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission <b>for</b> <b>Truth</b> and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29. Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 194 (I-194) is a , north–south freeway between {{downtown}} Battle Creek and I-94 in {{the southern}} portion of the city. The highway has been designated the Sojourner Truth Downtown Parkway by the state after the abolitionist Sojourner Truth, who {{was active in the}} Battle Creek area. Locals refer to the freeway by its semi-official nickname,"The Penetrator". I-194 is the only three-digit spur or loop route off I-94 in the state of Michigan and runs concurrently throughout its length with M-66, which continues both north and south from the termini of I-194. The freeway was initially opened in 1961 and completed in its current form in 1966. The highway was named in 1976 <b>for</b> <b>Truth</b> in honor of her local connections to the area.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{offered a}} public apology {{on behalf of}} the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other federal parties in the Canadian House of Commons. Nine days prior, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was {{established}} to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre <b>for</b> <b>Truth</b> and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time.|$|E
50|$|Following this, Powell's {{attorney}} {{was successful}} in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens <b>for</b> <b>Truth's</b> public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, {{which at the time}} was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens <b>for</b> <b>Truth's</b> representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.|$|R

Presentists should (but cannot) locate truth-makers <b>for</b> <b>truths</b> about the past. What can presentists say in response? We identify two rival factions: ‘upstanding’ and ‘nefarious’ presentists. Upstanding presentists aim to meet the challenge, positing presently existing truth-makers <b>for</b> <b>truths</b> about the past; nefarious presentists aim to shirk their responsibilities, using the language of truth-maker theory but without paying any ontological price. We argue that presentists should be nefarious presentists...|$|R

5|$|Specter {{was born}} in Wichita, Kansas, the {{youngest}} child of Lillie (née Shanin) and Harry Specter, {{who grew up in}} the Bachkuryne village of Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Specter was Jewish, and wrote in his memoir, Passion <b>for</b> <b>Truth,</b> that his father's family was the only Jewish family in the village. The family lived at 940 South Emporia Street in Wichita before moving to Russell, Kansas, where he graduated from Russell High School in 1947. Russell is also the hometown of fellow politician Bob Dole (who graduated from Russell High School in 1941). Specter said that his father weighed items from his junkyard on a scale owned by Dole's father Doran Dole (who owned a granary). He said his brother Morton and Dole's brother Kenny were contemporaries and friends.|$|E
5|$|The Yomesh cult is the {{official}} religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found parallels between the Yomesh cult and Christianity, such {{as the presence of}} saints and angels, and the use of a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as a critique of the influence of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely honest, and that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary <b>for</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E
