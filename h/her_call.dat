25|$|Despite {{the success}} of these volumes, it was the release of Coal in 1976 that {{established}} Lorde as an influential voice in the Black Arts Movement, and the large publishing house behind it -- Norton -- helped introduce her to a wider audience.

Lorde followed Coal up with Between Our Selves (also in 1976) and Hanging Fire (1978).|$|E

25|$|According to the {{relatives}} of Betty Ong, a flight attendant on a hijacked American Airlines plane, a clip from <b>her</b> <b>call</b> to headquarters {{was used in the}} beginning of the film without attribution. They demanded that, if the film won any awards, the filmmakers apologize at the Academy Awards ceremony for using the clip without getting her heirs' consent. Her family also asked that the film's U.S. distributors make a charitable donation in Ong's name, and should go on record that the Ong family does not endorse the use of torture. The end of the film already includes a statement paying tribute to the victims and the families of the 9/11 attacks, and the film producers have already contributed to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Mary and Frank Fetchet, parents of Brad Fetchet, who worked on the 89th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, criticized the filmmakers for using a recording of their son's voicemail without permission. The recording has previously been heard in broadcast TV news reports and in testimony for the 9/11 Commission.|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia {{back to the days of}} the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued <b>her</b> <b>call</b> for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E

The girl also turned a small room in her house as a domestic chapel. Martillo had a clear perception of <b>her</b> <b>call</b> to saintliness as a child and received her Confirmation on 16 September 1839. Martillo frequented a small wood near her home for contemplation in solitude while the guava tree near which she went to is now a large pilgrimage destination. The girl also chose the then-Blessed Mariana de Jesús as her patron with whom she identified and strived to imitate in her own life. Martillo was known for being sweet and thoughtful with a peaceful and generous disposition; she was obedient to those around her and was well-known and loved in her village. Martillo was blonde with bright blue eyes and was strong and agile; she was also tall.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Lois Pope, {{widow of}} National Enquirer owner Generoso Pope Jr., met a {{disabled}} American veteran at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and {{realized there was}} no memorial in the city which honored disabled veterans. Although {{she did not know}} him, Pope called the office of United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put <b>her</b> <b>call</b> through. Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Because the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 (P.L. 99-625) barred the expenditure of federal funds for memorials, a foundation needed to be established to oversee private fundraising. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), an organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans. The DAV was itself not a nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation (DVLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created. Brown (who left office in 1997), Pope, and Wilson incorporated the foundation in 1998, and Wilson was named its president.|$|E
