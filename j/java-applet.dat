40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} a graphical programming approach for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) based on a special type of Petri net, the Signal Interpreted Petri Net (SIPN). We give an introduction to PLCs and the languages designed to program them. From this overview we conclude that in this application area a language is missing {{that is capable of}} the simple graphical description of sequential and concurrent behavior. SIPN are such a language. We present the SIPN approach and some corresponding analysis methods. Since programming a controller without tool-support is nearly impossible {{we present a}} tool for graphical editing, animation, and compilation of SIPN. In the development of the tool, not only the implementation of the SIPN as it is defined in theory played a role, but the projected application area and user interest was also considered. The tool was implemented using DiaGen, an innovative workbench for generating graphics editors. Due to the fact that a new method is best promoted if it is freely available and furthermore not very demanding in resources and administrative efforts, the tool was realized as a <b>Java-Applet</b> that can be executed from a standard web browser on virtually any PC.

Signals from GPS satellites are used to time synchronise signals from the widely separated detector stations, allowing cosmic ray air showers to be identified and studied. A low-cost and highly scalable data acquisition system has been produced using embedded Linux processors which communicate station data to a central server. Air shower data can be visualised in real-time using a <b>Java-applet</b> client. The design and performance {{of the first three}} detector stations located at the AlbaNova University Centre are presented. The detectors have been running since the beginning of October 2005 and the data from this period is analysed to assess the stability and performance of the detector array. A total of 503 showers with a primary particle energy above 1016 eV, hitting all three detector stations simultaneously, have been detected during this period. The read out and data-base system used to collect the data are described together with a quicklook tool for ensuring the integrity of the data. A preliminary study of the acceptance of the detector array as a function of weather conditions, to be used in future studies of cosmic ray anisotropy, is presented. The acceptance of the single detector stations is found to decrease with increasing atmospheric pressure and to stay constant over a large range of temperatures. The acceptance of the entire array of detector stations is found to have a stronger continuous dependence on temperature than single stations. The dependence of the array acceptance on pressure is inconclusive. The ability of the array to reconstruct the primary cosmic ray direction is assessed with simulations. A critical feature for the reconstruction is the time resolution of the system. The performance of the GPS system is therefore tested, and the time resolution is found to be better than 15 ns for all tested GPS units. The angular resolution of the array for this time resolution is found to be (7. 0 ± 0. 3) ^∘. As the time resolution is expected to decrease for a larger array of detectors, the dependency of the time resolution on the angular resolution is derived. The measured distribution of the primary cosmic ray arrival direction is derived and compared to the expected distribution to check the performance of the system. The agreement between the distributions is good and the GPS timing system can therefore be concluded to work well. The simulations also show that the energy threshold of the array is slightly above 1016 eV. A preliminary study of the cosmic ray anisotropy is presented. The hypothesis of an isotropic flux of cosmic rays was tested using a two point correlation function. The probability that the observed flux is a random sampling from an isotropic flux was checked with a Kolmogorov test and it was found to be 82...|$|E
40|$|While {{designing}} {{and development of}} e-learning courses the LCMS MOODLE standard elements are deficient.

A teacher can use standard components (modules activity) to build the course in LCMS MOODLE. In case the teacher has not enough standard modules for students training activities, including physics, he can add other modules that are not included in the official version of the MOODLE system.

Such supplementary material represents a motivating but also a very effective chance to deepen and to increase the knowledge acquired in the lecture. This paper gives some general guidelines for building interactive Web-based animations. Beyond that, two of our developed animations are presented in detail.

Our goal for this system is for accelerator researchers and engineers {{to be able to}} diagnose any accelerator problems from their offices or homes via the Internet. A recently developed Java language is used for various graphic displays of the operation records which are saved in the database. The database which provides real-time information to the Internet is separated from the control database and has been installed on the www server.

The transmission of the data from the control database to the www database is achieved using a replication function having the MS-SQL.

It is much more effective to profound the theoretical knowledge if you can show the usage of a formula and grasp its functioning.

Thus as complement for the teaching in first year classes modules for specific relevant subtopics are to be designed, composed and tested. These have to fit into the teaching curriculum of Physics. At present one finds many (mostly Java-) applets for some specific effects in the net. They are distributed by multitude of authors and spread around the world. There is a need of editored framework and a portal for this materials. It is also planned to evaluate the existing and develop new ones for different purposes.
