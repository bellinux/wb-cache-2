40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} decision support during the design of applications for the cloud, or migration of existing applications to a cloud environment. For this purpose, a GENeralized Topology Language (<b>GENTL)</b> is introduced and mappings from existing languages to <b>GENTL</b> are provided. An annotation scheme for <b>GENTL,</b> which can capture annotations to topologies and topology elements is designed and instantiations for different annotation types are given. A framework implementing import functionalities for the topology languages Blueprint and TOSCA is presented. The framework enables the annotation of topologies with documentation annotations, references to external resources and incorporates a series of annotations {{which can be used}} to retrieve cost calculations from the external decision support system Nefolog...|$|E
40|$|Logic meta-programming in Prolog is a {{powerful}} way to express program analysis and transformation. However, its use can be difficult and error-prone because it requires programmers to know the meta-level representation of the analysed language and to think and express their analyses {{in terms of this}} lowlevel representation. In addition, the backtracking-based evaluation strategy of Prolog may lead to subtle semantic problems when used to express transformations of a logic database. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, <b>GenTL,</b> a generic transformation language that combines logic-based C onditional T ransformations (CTs) and concrete syntax patterns. This combination addresses the above problems while still offering the full expressive power of logic meta-programming. Compared to approaches based on other formalisms, the design of <b>GenTL</b> offers advantages in terms of composability and easy transformation interference analysis...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} role that racial concordance, defined {{as the percentage of}} African Americans in one’s environment, plays in the relation between racial socialization and racial identity. African American (n=- 160) students evaluated their perception of parental socialization, racial concordance, and racial identity. As hypothesized, racial socialization significantly predicted racial identity. As well, racially concordant environments moderated the relation between racial socialization and racial identity. Minority and cultural socialization were the best predictors of racial identity. Conclusions emphasize the importance of proactive racial socialization and supportive environments.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{of the dynamics}} and radiation in a solar Ñare loop are presented. The heating processes in the lower atmosphere include nonthermal heating by accelerated electrons and thermal soft X-ray irradiation from the Ñare-heated transition region and corona. Important transitions of hydrogen, helium, and singly ionized calcium and magnesium are treated in non-LTE. The principal results of the analysis are the following: 1. An impulsive event {{can be described as}} having two distinct dynamic phases, each with a deÐnite observational signature: an initial gentle phase, characterized by an atmospheric state of near-equilibrium, and a subsequent explosive phase, characterized by large material Ñows and strong hydrody-namic waves and shocks. The amount of time the atmosphere remains in the gentle phase is determined by the level of nonthermal heating. Excess line emission produced during the gentle phase is not signiÐ-cantly Doppler-shifted, and the proÐles remain symmetric about their nominal line-center frequencies. Emission proÐles generated during the explosive phase can be highly Doppler-shifted and distorted, reÑecting the material motion and steep velocity gradients present at their depths of formation. 2.

40|$|One surface moiety {{that has}} been found to {{modulate}} activation by the alternative pathway is sialic acid. Activating particles such as zymosan and rabbit erythrocytes are relatively deficient in surface-associated sialic acid, whereas nonactivating particles such as sheep erythrocytes contain an abundance of sialic acid moieties (1 - 3). Enzymatic removal of sialic acid residues with neuraminidase (1, 2) or conversion by mild oxidation with sodium periodate and reduction with borohydride to heptulosonic acid (1) converts the sheep erythrocyte from a nonactivating to an activating surface for the alternative pathway. Activation by sheep erythrocytes requires removal or modification of at least 40 % of membrane sialic acid, and increases proportionately when larger amounts are affected (1). Surface-associated sialic acid modulates alternative pathway function by increasing the affinity offllH relative to B for C 3 b. This results in blocking formation of the alternative pathway C 3 convertase C 3 bBb (1 - 3). The native polysaccharide antigen of type III, group B Streptococcus consists of a repeating unit of galactose, glucose, glucosamine, and a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a molar ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 : 1 (4, 5).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} treatment by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of cases of elephantiasis of the lower limb in Gambia, British West Africa. Elephantiasis in the tropics is associated with infection by the filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti and occurs in areas where this parasite is endemic. The adult worms, which inhabit the lymph-atics of the groin, are believed to produce ocdema and later elephantiasis by obstruction of the lymph flow. It was thought first, that ACTH might interfere with the reaction round the worms in the lymphatics of the groin; and second, that ACTH might {{reduce the amount of}} elephantoid tissue in the limb. This elephantoid tissue is connective tissue much hypertrophied on account of the lymphstasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Measurement of the limbs. Direct measurement of the circumference of the leg at fixed points by a tape measure was found to be inaccurate. Therefore a method of measure-ment by water displacement was used. A bucket of approximately 12 inches diameter by 16 inches deep was filled with water. The patient inserted his leg, and when movement had stopped, the level of the water was raised until it overflowed. The leg was then <b>gentl...</b>|$|E
40|$|HE PRESENT s’ru was {{suggested}} {{by the lack of}} data on plasma tn-butyrinase (lipase) activity in the neonatal period. Titrimetric methods are not practical for small amounts of blood and it was found necessary to adapt the method of Goldstein et al. (1) to an electrometric proce-dure. Such a modification reduced to %o the amount of plasma and reagents needed in the titrimetric method. Troescher and Norris (2) determined blood esterase electrometrically by the addition of oxalated blood to a 0. 15 M phosphate buffer at pH 8. 9 with ethyl butyrate as substrate. It has since been shown that tributyrin substrate results in appreciably higher enzymatic activity (3) than does ethyl butyrate. The preparation of our substrate was identical with that described in Standard Methods of Clinical Chemistry (4) with the omission of sodium choleate (1). The modified electrometric procedure reported here has been used in our laboratory for routine clinical determinations of tribu-tyrinase and found satisfactory. MEtHOD Blood specimens were obtained in the neonatal period at varying times between the first and sixth days of life.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of pollutants behavior in agrolandscapes being under the pressing of industrial contamination is greatly important for regulation and making prognoses of plant quality. In numerous studies heavy metals (HM) contamination of soils and plants {{was investigated in}} field experiments, but on plane territories with {{the same type of}} hydrology and soil (Alloway, 1995; Kabata-Pendias,Pendias, 1992; Iskandar, 2001). Essential part of agrolandscapes belong to lands of slopes with different intensity of erosion. Erosion plays a significant role in differentiation of soil cover and substances redistribution in the landscape, such as HM and radionuclides (Fless, 1998). Thus erosion determines not only plants growth, but also the content of pollutants in their tissues. Attention was focused on the redistribution of different HM in soils and plants of slope agrolandscape situated on south outskirts of Moscow near by thermoelectric power station (500 - 1000 m), chemical factory (1000 m) and Moscow circle high way (100 - 350 m). Soils of the investigated slope were agricultural sandy soddi soils. The largest part of the slope is slightly eroded, only 5 - 10 % of soils are strongly eroded. Investigations were carried out in 1997 - 2003. Every year plants (corn, oat, vetch and weeds) and associated soils were sampled on <b>gentl...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and {{evaluate}} the shaping ability of the three different Ni-Ti file systems used by undergraduate students. Fifty undergraduate students prepared 150 simulated curved root canals in resin blocks with three Ni-Ti file systems- ProFile � (PF), Manual ProTaper � (MPT), Rotary ProTaper � (RPT). Every stu-dent prepared 3 simulated root canals with each system respectively. After root canal preparation, the Ni-Ti files were evaluated for distortion or breakage. Assessments were made according to the presence of various types of canal aberrations. The pre- and post-instrumented canal images were attained and superimposed. The instrumented root canal width were measured and calculated for the net transportation (deviation) and the centering ratio. Under the condition of this study, both ProTaper � systems allowed significantly more removal of root canal wall than the ProFile � system. In the important other aspects such as the centering ratio, there was no significant differences between the systems. Novice dental students were able to pre-pare curved root canals with any kinds of Ni-Ti file systems with little aberration and great conser-vation of tooth structure. Students want to learn effective methods and at the same time simple rotary procedures. The rotary ProTaper � systems were one of the most compatible to these students from the point of view of cutting ability. The ProFile � system was also compatible in safe and <b>gentl...</b>|$|E
40|$|I here hypothesize {{a causal}} {{relationship}} between the conditions of oppression and expressions of utopia. Roughly: the more a people, culture, and/or ethnicity experience physical space as a site of political, cultural, and literal encroachment, the more that distinct cultures utopian ideas tend to appear in non-spatial [...] -specifically, temporal and introspective [...] -formulations. To support this hypothesis, I examine texts like Mircea Eliade's The Forbidden Forest, Sergiu Fărcăşan's A Love Story from the Year 41, 042, Bujor Nedelcovici's The Second Messenger, Oana Orlea's Perimeter Zero, Costache Olăreanu's Fear; Ben Okri's Astonishing the Gods; Kajo Laing's Major <b>Gentl</b> and the Achimota Wars; Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosome: A Novel of Fevers, Delirium and Discovery; and The Zohar: The Book of Splendor, and practices like the Sabbath in Classical Kabbalah and the Paltinis Paidetic school. I select specific structural, linguistic, and narrative content elements of these works to capture particular moments in the large-scale move from space to time, while mapping this emigration of a particular people's utopian imagination onto the relevant historico-political contexts which shape it. My fieldwork strongly suggests that Romanian, Nigerian, Ghanaian, Indian, and Jewish analogous utopian traditions deploy temporality, metaphysical speculation, introspection, irony, punning, and censor-avoiding subterfuge. I also examine readings like Theodor Herzl's Altneuland/Old New Land, which shows the occasional reversal of the temporalizing trend once historical conditions are once again propitious, and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time, and Ama Ata Aidoo's Changes, which, as intra-cultural cases of oppression, show how the same utopian impulse finds expression in an 'inner time' when they are not. Finally, having supported my thesis from the past, I examine present-day expressions of utopian aspirations (Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy, communities like The EdenProject in England, The Damanhur Federation in Italy, Auroville in India, and cities like Masdar in United Arab Emirates and New Songdo in South Korea) and note that complex, dialogical accounts, addressing meta-concerns that have outgrown cultures and nations, now dominate the utopian field.
