500|$|Weiner {{said that}} the episode is [...] "about the {{children}}. It's about who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the children. Youth {{is a big part}} of our lives in general. Now and then. But when you think of the sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|E
500|$|... "Marilyn Monroe" [...] {{was first}} leaked in February 2012. On May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's {{official}} website asking fans {{to choose the}} next single(s). The poll was divided into three categories: The first category asked fans to choose between [...] "Marilyn Monroe", [...] "Fire Burns", [...] "Young Forever", and [...] "Gun Shot". [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] had the most votes and won the poll; [...] "Young Forever" [...] came in second, [...] "Fire Burns" [...] came in third, and [...] "Gun Shot" [...] came in fourth. When asked whether [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] would become a single during an interview with The Guardian, Minaj replied: [...] "It has to be. It will be.

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he. [...] "Well I am glad of that, for {{you will}} be able to do the more for poor George. He will have wants; he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> and trouble on himself. Neither he nor his {{sweetheart}} have, I take it, been accustomed to do without wants; and their income will be tight enough--forby what you can do for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of him," [...] {{declared}} Gabe Werner quickly. [...] "I wouldn't {{go out in}} {{that storm}} again for a thousand dollars." ...|$|R

2500|$|Dresnok {{asserts that}} [...] "because of the {{sanctions}} of the US Government and Japanese", during the North Korean famine of the 1990s, he was always given his full food ration by the government. [...] "Why? Why do they let their own people starve to death to feed an American?", he asked. [...] "The Great Leader {{has given us a}} special solicitude. The government is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> me until my dying day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul also stated, [...] "why {{do we have}} 900 {{bases in}} 130 {{countries}} and we're totally bankrupt. How do you rebuild a military when we have no money? How are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the people? I think this wild goal to have another war {{in the name of}} defense is the dangerous thing. The danger is really us overreacting. We need a strong national defense, and we need to only go to war with a declaration of war." [...] Later in the debate, Rick Perry received attention when he called himself the [...] "Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses," [...] when asked how he would compete against President Barack Obama in a general election debate.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was {{pregnant}} with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. [...] Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. [...] During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from {{a portrait of the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. [...] At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: [...] "Don't you know that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> your children?"

50|$|The {{school has}} two {{crocodiles}} which are considered as important {{components in the}} school's tapestry.

2500|$|The actress {{said that}} Lynsey feels guilty {{because she is}} in a {{relationship}} with Riley behind Mercedes' back, but Lynsey feels that she deserves to be happy because she usually places everyone else's needs above her own. Mercedes discovers Lynsey's relationship with Riley, which Metcalfe explained comes as a shock to Mercedes who has developed a close friendship with Lynsey so does not react as expected. Hassan said that her character's love rivals, Mercedes and Mitzeee, [...] "won't be looking after Lynsey's best interests, so she's going to have to fight for Riley's love. She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> number one - and if other people get hurt in the process, then so be it". She added that Lynsey values her friendship with Mercedes and would not want to lose it while Mitzeee {{is a different kind of}} threat. Hassan went on to say that the storyline will become [...] "deeper and darker" [...] and is not going to end happily, as even though Lynsey and Riley make a good couple Lynsey has never been lucky with men.|$|E
2500|$|Greenlee reveals {{herself to}} Jack. Jack cannot believe {{his eyes when}} Greenlee appears before him. After {{explaining}} how David hid her away for a year, Greenlee threatens to disappear from Jack's life again if he presses charges against David. Greenlee demands that Jack not tell anyone, especially Ryan, that she is alive. On Valentine's Day, David walks {{down the aisle and}} is joined by his heavily veiled bride, whose face is obscured. Just as Jack, Erica and Ryan walk in, Greenlee reveals herself as the bride. Greenlee's sudden [...] "return from the dead" [...] sends shock waves through the assembled guests, who soon take their leave with the exception of Ryan (but not before everyone tells Greenlee it is a dumb idea to marry David). Ryan's speechless over Greenlee's intention to marry David, let alone on Valentine's Day of all days. Ryan tells Greenlee he never stopped loving her and is dismayed she kept her survival a secret from him. Greenlee defends David, insisting {{he is the one who}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her now. Despite her insistence that Ryan stay away, it is obvious that she still cares for him. Annie crashes the now non-wedding and is stunned to see Greenlee. Ryan lets Greenlee go but remains confident they will get back together one day. Greenlee explains to David why it is so important to her that they get married: It will protect her from falling back in love with Ryan. David and Greenlee's wedding gets underway.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the album}} {{does not tell}} a {{specific}} story like her previous album Hadestown, Mitchell has stated that the album was [...] "influenced by the recession", and {{that many of the}} lyrics allude to the loss of certainty and the old ways in modern-day America: [...] "There's a feeling that the American is something of an orphan, that we can't trust we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of".

To get an American visa, Rožman did not visit the consulate in Berne, he communicated with the United States Consulate General at Zürich on 25 May for the purpose of obtaining a visitor's visa to the United States. On 28 May, he appeared at the Consulate General where he was informed of U.S. regulations regarding the issue of a non-quota immigration visa as a minister of religion. Rožman and Šarić were not together in Switzerland. Rožman was residing at the Institut Menzingen, near Zug, and Šarić was residing at Haute Rive near Friborg.“In Berne, Rožman's Ustashi friends were engaged in wholesale fraud, using the black market to convert the gold into dollars, and later, into Austrian schillings. 'Aid to the refugees is accounted for at the official rate of exchange for dollars', the American officers noted, adding that 'malpractices have been carried on (officially, the dollar is worth 10 schillings; on the black market, 100 to 150). According to reliable information: 'Rožman is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Berne <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of these finances. The money is in a Swiss bank, and he plans to have most of it sent through to Italy and from there to the Ustaše in the Argentine.'”“A short time later Rožman duly arrived in Berne, accompanied by Bishop Ivan Šarić, the 'hangman' of Sarajevo. By the end of May 1948, Rožman had apparently carried out this money laundering operation for the Ustashi, for he visited the U.S. Consulate in Zürich and was given a 'non-quota immigration visa as a minister of religion'. He then traveled to the United States and settled in Cleveland, Ohio. The circle was now almost complete.
