One wheel was tested in arrangements to simulate both nonretracted and partially retracted types. The landing gears were tested {{in conjunction with a}} fuselage, and the effects of <b>wheel</b> <b>extension</b> and longitudinal location were determined. The drag changed very little with either longitudinal location or <b>wheel</b> <b>extension</b> for the landing gear with the lowest drag; a completely faired landing gear of the wheelspan, single-strut type. The drag of the trouser-type landing gear increased considerably, however, with an increase in the <b>wheel</b> <b>extension.</b> The <b>wheel</b> of the unaired retractable landing gear was at least one-half retracted into the fuselage before the drag became less than that of the best nonretracted landing gear. The drag per unit frontal area of the landing gears of the present tests was about the same as that found for similar landing gears in earlier tests...|$|R

40|$|A {{network is}} called localizable if the {{positions}} of all the nodes of the network can be computed uniquely. If a network is localizable and embedded in plane with generic configuration, {{the positions of}} the nodes may be computed uniquely in finite time. Therefore, identifying localizable networks is an important function. If the complete information about the network is available at a single place, localizability can be tested in polynomial time. In a distributed environment, networks with trilateration orderings (popular in real applications) and <b>wheel</b> <b>extensions</b> (a specific class of localizable networks) embedded in plane can be identified by existing techniques. We propose a distributed technique which efficiently identifies a larger class of localizable networks. This class covers both trilateration and <b>wheel</b> <b>extensions.</b> In reality, exact distance is almost impossible or costly. The proposed algorithm based only on connectivity information. It requires no distance information...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of localizable {{conditions}} for sensor nodes in a two-dimensional sensor network. A new group of conditions are proposed which judge each node's localizability through analyzing its connections with not only a set of already localized nodes but also its other neighbors. Our new conditions allow up to four nodes to be localized at a time. This algorithm offers a substantial improvement in localizability over the well-known trilateration method and convex hull method. We show that a newly developed <b>WHEEL</b> <b>extension</b> condition is a special case of our conditions. We also demonstrate that our result {{can be used as}} a guideline to modify topology of a network for better localizability...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the problem}} of {{deformation}} quantization we introduce and study directed graph complexes with oriented loops and wheels. We develop a new technique for computing cohomology of such graph complexes in terms of other much simpler purely operadic graph complexes. As an application we compute cohomology of <b>wheeled</b> <b>extensions</b> of several classical examples (including the one associated with the minimal resolution of the PROP of Lie bialgebras) and also give a new purely PROPic proof of Kontsevich’s theorem on existence of star products on formal germs of Poisson manifolds. The first instances of graph complexes have been introduced {{in the theory of}} operads and PROPs which have found recently lots of applications in algebra, topology and geometry. Another set of examples has been introduced by Kontsevich [Ko 1, Ko 2] as a way to expose highly non-trivial interrelations between certain infinite dimensional Lie algebras and topologica...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the node localizability problem in 2 -D, aiming at determining which nodes are localizable in a sensor network with internode distance measurements. Toward this objective, a sequential cluster-based approach is proposed. The {{idea is to}} expand the set of localizable nodes starting from the set of anchor nodes cluster by cluster rather than node by node. Taking computation efficiency in practice into account, we consider {{the size of a}} cluster up to four nodes each time. Then, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition to determine whether a cluster up to four nodes is jointly localizable given the distance measurements among them and the distance measurements between them and their neighbors with known coordinates. In terms of this necessary and sufficient condition, both centralized and distributed algorithms are developed for detecting localizable nodes in a given sensor network. It is demonstrated that our approach outperforms well-known techniques, such as trilateration, bilatration, and <b>wheel</b> <b>extension</b> in finding as many localizable nodes as possible...|$|R

50|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing and test runs at the Nardò circuit in Italy, a prototype {{was presented to}} the project management. This was based on an XR4i body with provisional body modifications in fibreglass and aluminium. The car’s appearance raised little enthusiasm. The large rear wing caused particular reluctance. Pinske insisted however that the modifications were necessary to make the project successful. The rear wing was essential to retain ground contact at 300 km/h, the opening between the headlights was needed to feed air to the intercooler and the <b>wheel</b> arch <b>extensions</b> had to be there to house wheels 10” wide on the racing version. Eventually, the Ford designers agreed to try to make a production version based on the prototype.|$|R

In the first, the timer interval is hashed into a slot on the timing wheel. In the second, a hierarchy of timing wheels with different granularities is used to span a greater range of intervals.
