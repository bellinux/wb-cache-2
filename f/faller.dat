25|$|A counter <b>faller</b> {{under the}} thread {{was made to}} rise {{to take in the}} slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top <b>faller</b> wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were {{controlled}} by levers and cams and an inclined plane called the shaper. The spindle speed was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as the headstock moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None of this would have been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.|$|E
25|$|William Eaton, in 1818, {{improved}} the winding of the thread by using two <b>faller</b> wires and performing a backing {{off at the}} end of the outward traverse. All these mules had been worked by the strength of the operatives. The next improvement was a fully automatic mule.|$|E

25|$|The doffing {{took only}} a few minutes, the piecers would run {{the length of the}} mule gate thrutching five {{spindles}} a time, and the doffing involved lifting four cops from the spindles with the right hand and piling them on the left forearm and hand. To get a firm cop bottom, the minder would whip the first few layers of yarn. After the first few draws the minder would stop the mule at the start of an inward run and take it in slowly depressing and releasing the <b>faller</b> wire several times. Alternatively, a starch paste could be skillfully applied to the first few layers of yarn by the piecers – and later a small paper tube was dropped over spindle – this slowed down the doffing operation and extra payment was negotiated by the minders.|$|E
25|$|At {{the request}} of the pope, Montini {{established}} together with Ferdinando Baldelli and Otto <b>Faller</b> the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza (Pontifical Commission for Assistence), which aided large number of Romans and refugees from everywhere with shelter, food and other material assistance. In Rome alone this organization distributed almost two million portions of free food in the year 1944. The Papal Residence of Castel Gandolfo was opened to refugees, as was Vatican City in so far as space allowed. Some 15,000 persons lived in Castel Gandolfo alone, supported by the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza. At {{the request of}} Pius XII, Montini was also involved in the re-establishment of Church Asylum, providing protection to hundreds of Allied soldiers, who had escaped from Axis prison camps, Jews, anti-Fascists, Socialists, Communists, and after the liberation of Rome, German soldiers, partisans, displaced persons and others. As pope in 1971, Montini turned the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza into Caritas Italiana.|$|E

25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the <b>faller</b> pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

500|$|A few National Socialist {{black metal}} (NSBM) bands like the Nokturnal Mortum, or Russia's Temnozor and Kroda {{have been known}} to cross over into folk metal, a {{circumstance}} that Ciaran O'Hagan, the vocalist of Waylander, views as [...] "an insult to people like myself who don’t hold with fascist ideals at all." [...] He further suggests that the NSBM bands are playing folk metal [...] "for all the wrong reasons." [...] Due to the misappropriation of pagan symbols by Neo-Nazism, several folk metal bands have also been mistaken for being part of the NSBM scene. Consequently, such bands as Cruachan, Skyforger, Moonsorrow, Månegarm and Týr have had to disassociate themselves with Nazism, fascism or racism. Skyforger went as far as to add the words 'No Nazi Stuff Here!' on the back of their album covers. In April 2008, performers on the folk metal festival Paganfest were subject to accusations of being Nazis, racists and fascists from the German Antifa. Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and Heri Joensen of Týr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations, noting that [...] "one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the Týr logo [...] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years." [...] Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while Týr notes on their official website that they [...] "got the idea for the rune logo" [...] from the Black Sabbath album of the same name. On {{the other side of the}} political landscape, some folk metal bands have uttered explicit socialist sentiments. For example the aforementioned Glittertind made a leftist statement against neoliberalism in their album booklet when re-releasing the record Til Dovre <b>Faller</b> on Napalm Records in May 2009.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: Recently, {{long non-coding}} RNAs (lncRNAs) {{have been found}} to have many {{biological}} effects in different cancer stages. Several studies have revealed that focally amplified lncRNA on chromosome 1 (<b>FAL</b> 1) regulates cancer progression via p 21. However, the expression and mechanism of <b>FAL</b> 1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) still remain unclear. Methods: We detected the <b>FAL</b> 1 level in NSCLC tissues and in established cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR and evaluated the clinical significance. <b>FAL</b> 1 was silenced or overexpressed using siRNA or lentivirus to study whether <b>FAL</b> 1 affected cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Xenograft growth and pulmonary metastasis were observed using nude mouse models. The mechanisms were explored with western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: <b>FAL</b> 1 was significantly overexpressed in NSCLC compared with adjacent normal tissues, and a high level of <b>FAL</b> 1 correlated with poor histological grade, increased lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in vitro verified that knockdown of <b>FAL</b> 1 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT via the PTEN/AKT pathway. Furthermore, an in vivo assay confirmed that overexpression of <b>FAL</b> 1 facilitated tumor growth and metastasis. Conclusion: <b>FAL</b> 1 may promote tumorigenesis and progression of NSCLC through the PTEN/AKT axis, which could lead to lncRNA-related diagnostics and therapeutics in NSCLC...|$|R

2500|$|One {{explanation}} for the SRA allegations {{is that they were}} based upon false memories caused by the over-use of hypnosis and other suggestive techniques by therapists underestimating the suggestibility of their clients. The altered state of consciousness induced by hypnosis rendered patients an unusual ability to produce confabulations, often with the assistance of their therapists. Advocates of false memory syndrome (FMS), a controversial term promoted by the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, claim that the purported [...] "memories" [...] of ritual abuse are actually false memories, created iatrogenically through suggestion or coercion. The FMSF has used the idea of ritual abuse as a strategy to illustrate their position that most allegations of sexual abuse uncovered by the suggestive techniques used during recovered memory therapy are false [...] "memories" [...] of events that never happened. According to Kathleen <b>Faller</b> this has contributed to the sensationalization of the ritual abuse cases in the media.|$|E

[...] Following a private farewell service in the North Room at Sagamore Hill, a simple funeral was held at Christ Episcopal Church in Oyster Bay. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, Charles Evans Hughes, Warren Harding, Henry Cabot Lodge, and William Howard Taft were among the mourners. The snow-covered procession route to Youngs Memorial Cemetery was lined with spectators and a squad of mounted policemen who had ridden from New York City.
