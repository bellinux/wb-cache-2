25|$|NASA {{scientists}} {{now believe that}} the dark material is lag (residue) from the sublimation (evaporation) of water ice {{on the surface of}} Iapetus, possibly darkened further upon exposure to sunlight. Because of its slow rotation of 79days (equal to its revolution and the longest in the Saturnian system), Iapetus would have had the warmest daytime surface temperature and coldest nighttime temperature in the Saturnian system even before the development of the color contrast; near the equator, <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> by the dark material results in a daytime temperatures of 129K in the dark Cassini Regio compared to 113K in the bright regions. The difference in temperature means that ice preferentially sublimates from Cassini Regio, and deposits in the bright areas and especially at the even colder poles. Over geologic time scales, this would further darken Cassini Regio and brighten the rest of Iapetus, creating a positive feedback thermal runaway process of ever greater contrast in albedo, ending with all exposed ice being lost from Cassini Regio. It is estimated that over a period of one billion years at current temperatures, dark areas of Iapetus would lose about 20 meters of ice to sublimation, while the bright regions would lose only 10 centimeters, not considering the ice transferred from the dark regions. This model explains the distribution of light and dark areas, the absence of shades of grey, and the thinness of the dark material covering Cassini Regio. The redistribution of ice is facilitated by Iapetus's weak gravity, which means that at ambient temperatures a water molecule can migrate from one hemisphere to the other in just a few hops.|$|E

500|$|The {{difference}} between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase [...] "Climate {{is what you}} expect, weather is what you get." [...] Over historical time spans {{there are a number}} of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5°C (9°F) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar <b>heat</b> <b>absorption,</b> water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling.

50|$|Alternative {{stripper}} configurations include matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure with split feed. Many {{of these}} configurations offer more energy efficiency for specific solvents or operating conditions. Vacuum operation favors solvents with low <b>heats</b> of <b>absorption</b> while operation at normal pressure favors solvents with high <b>heats</b> of <b>absorption.</b> Solvents with high <b>heats</b> of <b>absorption</b> require less energy for stripping from temperature swing at fixed capacity. The matrix stripper recovers 40% of CO2 {{at a higher}} pressure and does not have inefficiencies associated with multipressure stripper. Energy and costs are reduced since the reboiler duty cycle is slightly less than normal pressure stripper. An Internal Exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to CO2 in the overheads stream, and therefore less steam is required. The multipressure configuration with split feed reduces the flow into the bottom section, which also reduces the equivalent work. Flashing feed requires less heat input because it uses the latent heat of water vapor to help strip some of the CO2 in the rich stream entering the stripper {{at the bottom of}} the column.

Carbon dioxide capture from an efficient power plant and other industrial processes using solvents is a developed technology but it reduces the overall efficiency of the process mainly due to energy needed to desorb chemically bound CO 2 with the solvent.

This <b>heat</b> of <b>absorption</b> and pumping energy requirement for a CO 2 capture plant depends on the type of solvent and its physical properties (viscosity, density etc).
