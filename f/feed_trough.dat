2500|$|Snails can be bred {{in boxes}} or cages stacked several units high. An {{automatic}} sprinkler {{system can be}} used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a <b>feed</b> <b>trough</b> and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.) ...|$|E

50|$|Washing {{is largely}} {{restricted}} to the upper portions where the cake surface is nearly horizontal in orientation, which occurs at {{the temperature of the}} feed. The ceramic filter uses a sintered alumina disc to dewater slurry under low vacuum. The dewatering occurs by drawing water from the slurry by capillary action.

5000|$|Sham dustbathing (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "vacuum dustbathing") is a behaviour performed by some birds when kept in cages {{with little or no}} access to litter. During sham dustbathing, the birds perform all the elements of normal dust bathing, but in the complete absence of any substrate. [...] This behaviour often has all the activities and temporal patterns of normal dustbathing, i.e. the bird initially scratches and bill-rakes at the ground, then erects her feathers and squats. Once lying down, the behaviour contains four main elements: vertical wing-shaking, head rubbing, bill-raking and scratching with one leg.

[...] Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration. [...] Vent pecking can be related to disease or immune challenge as it sometimes becomes prevalent in cases of Gumboro disease (Infectious Bursal Disease) and is increased by challenges with the protein antigen, human serum albumin (HuSA). [...] Housing design can influence vent pecking. Mortality caused by cannibalism was reduced when hens had sufficient room to perch all facing the <b>feed</b> <b>trough,</b> thus giving their perch-mates little opportunity to peck at the vent region [...] and increased pecking activity and cannibalistic behaviour can occur due to inadequate height of the perches. [...] Larger group sizes lead to increases in vent pecking suggesting that social learning plays a role.|$|E
