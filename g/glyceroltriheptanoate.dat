40|$|A {{recently}} issued European Regulation {{requires that}} the artificial marker substance <b>glyceroltriheptanoate</b> (GTH) has {{to be added to}} the portion of processed animal by-product that must not enter the feed and food chain. The objective of this new requirement is to allow for full traceability and to ensure that these materials are disposed of in a proper way. Here we report on the development and single-laboratory validation of an analytical method for the determination of GTH in meat and bone meal and animal fat. The method is based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or flame ionisation detection. The results of the validation study confirm an acceptable performance profile expressed in terms of sensitivity, precision, trueness, ruggedness and transferability of the method. The developed method is therefore considered fit for intended purpose and can be utilised by EU Member States laboratories within the frame of official control. JRC.
