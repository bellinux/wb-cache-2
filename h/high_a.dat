40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{diversity and}} community structure of <b>high</b> arsenic (<b>As)</b> aquifers was investigated using an integrated approach adopting both geochemistry and molecular biology (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16 S rRNA gene clone library analyses). Nine borehole sediments and one groundwater sample {{from the living}} place of a villager (affected by arseniasis) and 12 sediments from a control borehole in Hetao Plain were investigated. The As concentrations ranged from 33. 6 to 77. 6 mg/kg in <b>high</b> <b>As</b> borehole sediments and 1. 5 to 5. 8 mg/kg in those samples from the control. The As concentration in the groundwater was 744. 8 μg/L. Ratios between As(III) and total <b>As</b> in <b>high</b> <b>As</b> sediments increased gradually with depth and ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 34. Similarly, the Fe(II) /total Fe presented the same increasing trend with depth. The correlation between TOC contents and total <b>As</b> was positive. <b>High</b> concentrations of total As, S, Fe and TOC were found in clay and low in sand samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed significantly different bacterial communities among <b>high</b> <b>As</b> sediments, control sediments and the <b>high</b> <b>As</b> groundwater. Both DGGE and 16 S rRNA gene clone library {{results showed that the}} <b>high</b> <b>As</b> sediments were dominated by Thiobacillus, Pseudomonas, Brevundimonas, and Hydrogenophaga, with Thiobacillus being distinctly dominant (63. 5 %). Whereas the low As sediments were dominated by some other genera including Psychrobacter, Massilia and Desulfotalea. The bacterial populations in the <b>high</b> <b>As</b> groundwater mainly included Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Aquabacterium. These results improve our understanding of the bacterial diversity in <b>high</b> <b>As</b> aquifers in Hetao Plain and suggest how specific bacterial populations help mediate the mobilization of <b>As</b> into <b>high</b> <b>As</b> groundwaters...|$|R

5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed in the country, supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that could afford it. Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained <b>high.</b> <b>A</b> large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the spring}} and early summer of 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} a series of defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces.

On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too <b>high</b> <b>a</b> temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the sinking, public inquiries were set up in Britain and the United States. The US inquiry began on 19April under the chairmanship of Senator William Alden Smith, while the British inquiry commenced in London under Lord Mersey on 2May 1912. They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too <b>high</b> <b>a</b> speed. Captain Lord of Californian was strongly criticised by both inquiries for failing to render assistance to Titanic.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 insect species prey on H. zea, usually {{feeding on}} eggs and larvae. The {{insidious}} flower bug (Orius insidiosus), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of H. zea, thus {{acting as a}} biological control agent. Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from H. zea, which attract parasitic insects. Cardiochiles nigriceps, a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of H. zea. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, they use their antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp Microplitis croceipes, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, {{is also an important}} parasitoid of both H. zea and the related species Heliothis virescens. When larval densities are <b>high,</b> <b>a</b> fungal pathogen, Nomuraea rileyi, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal mortality is high not because of predators, but because of harsh weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.|$|E

Romako based his design on the German Zieten, though the German vessel was significantly faster than the Zara class, in part owing {{to the fact that}} Zieten had a longer, finer hull and was more lightly built.

5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin <b>High,</b> <b>a</b> play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E
