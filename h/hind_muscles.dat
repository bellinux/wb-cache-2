5000|$|On 13 December 2007, RSPCA {{inspectors}} {{and a government}} vet arrived at the Bhaktivedanta Manor temple in Hertfordshire and killed Gangotri by the administration of a lethal injection. Gangotri was not suffering from any disease but had damaged her <b>hind</b> <b>muscles</b> and could not stand. [...] She was cared for by the temple staff and the temple had employed vets to medically care for her and to monitor her health. The temple, donated in 1973 by George Harrison, runs The Cow Protection Project, a no-kill shelter where cows and bulls are allowed to die naturally. The RSPCA claimed that the cow was suffering however they killed the cow without consultation with the vets treating the cow. [...] They claimed to have consulted with other vets to which temple officials counter that"Two veterinary surgeons, one who lived locally {{and the other a}} specialist based in Oxford, were regularly supervising the cow’s medical treatment. They were administering medicine themselves, and also guiding the daily care being given by the community members. It is normal farming practise that once a cow is down or cannot walk, she will be killed by the vet because, within a few weeks, physical complications will arise that most farmers don’t have the time to deal with. As a religious community, we made the choice to care, and those two vets chose to support us. Two other vets, who were unfamiliar with the way we work with animals, one of whom was merely a passer-by, gave different opinions. At first, the chief vet responsible for animal welfare in the appropriate government department, known as Defra, also gave a recommendation that the cow be killed. When he made a personal visit to the temple however, and saw how the animal was being cared for, he informed us that no further action would be taken".|$|E
40|$|Hematopoietic {{progenitor}} cell transplantation {{can contribute to}} revascularization of ischemic tissues. Yet, the optimal cell population to be transplanted {{has yet to be}} determined. We have compared the therapeutic potential of two subsets of human cord blood CD 34 + progenitors, either expressing the VEGF-A receptor 2 (KDR) or not. In serum-free starvation culture, CD 34 +KDR+ cells reportedly showed greater resistance to apoptosis and ability to release VEGF-A, as compared with CD 34 +KDR- cells. When injected into the <b>hind</b> <b>muscles</b> in immunodeficient SCIDbg mice subjected to unilateral ischemia, a low number (10 (3)) of CD 34 +KDR+ cells improved limb salvage and hemodynamic recovery better than a larger dosage (10 (4)) of CD 34 +KDR- cells. The neovascularization induced by KDR+ cells was significantly superior to that promoted by KDR- cells. Similarly, endothelial cell apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis were significantly attenuated by KDR+ cells, which differentiated into mature human endothelial cells and also apparently skeletal muscle cells. This study demonstrates that a low number of CD 34 +KDR+ cells favors reparative neovascularization and possibly myogenesis in limb ischemia, suggesting the potential use of this cell population in regenerative medicine...|$|E
40|$|Histological, immunocytochemical and immunochemical {{characteristics}} of diaphragm muscle from mdx and control mice (14 -days to 12 -months of age) {{were compared to}} those of their <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles.</b> In contrast to mdx <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> regeneration after necrosis, which was evident after one month of age, does not restore the diaphragm muscle structure.

40|$|The Quarter Horse (bred for acceleration) and the Arab (bred for endurance) are {{situated}} {{at either end}} of the equine athletic spectrum. Studies into the form and function of the leg muscles in human sprint and endurance runners have demonstrated that differences exist in their muscle architecture. It is not known whether similar differences exist in the horse. Six Quarter Horse and six Arab fresh hind limb cadavers were dissected to gain information on the muscle mass and architecture of the following muscles: gluteus medius; biceps femoris; semitendinosus; vastus lateralis; gastrocnemius; tibialis cranialis and extensor digitorum longus. Specifically, muscle mass, fascicle length and pennation angle were quantified and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and maximum isometric force were estimated. The <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> of the Quarter Horse were of a significantly greater mass, but had similar fascicle lengths and pennation angles when compared with those of the Arab; this resulted in the Quarter Horse <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> having greater PCSAs and hence greater isometric force potential.

Animals in group 23 T and 77 DT were trained with treadmill running （～ 77 %VO 2 max, 60 min/day and 5 days/wk) for 10 weeks. The de-training period was 53 weeks. The {{results showed that the}} relative heart weight in group 23 T was significantly higher than group 23 C, 77 C and 77 DT.

40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) {{is known}} to promote {{proliferation}} and differentiation of muscle cells during growth and regeneration. Both these conditions are characterized by acquisition of specialized muscle functions, such as a large macroscopic chloride conductance (G(Cl)), a parameter that is a target of growth hormone (GH) /IGF-I axis action on skeletal muscle. The present study has been aimed at evaluating the role of IGF-I in the spontaneous regeneration occurring in <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscle</b> of dystrophic mdx mouse. IGF-I levels have been measured in <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles,</b> plasma and liver of mdx and control mice of 8 - 10 weeks and 5 months of age by radioimmunoassay. In parallel the biophysical and pharmacological properties of muscle chloride channels of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle fibers of mice belonging to the same age-group have been measured electrophysiologically in vitro. At 8 - 10 weeks of age, significantly greater amounts of IGF-I were found in plasma and <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> of mdx mice with respect to controls. Such a difference was only just detectable and no longer statistically significant at 5 months of age. No {{differences were found in}} hepatic IGF-I levels at either age. The EDL muscle fibers of mdx mice at 8 - 10 weeks of age were characterized by higher G(Cl) values and by a different pharmacological sensitivity to the enantiomers of 2 -(p-chlorophenoxy) - propionic acid (CPP), specific chloride channel ligands, with respect to age- matched controls. However, these differences were no longer detected at 5 months of age. Our results suggest a role of IGF-I in the high regenerative potential of muscles from mdx mice and support the hypothesis that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of chloride channels of EDL muscle fibers are sensitive indices of the action of regeneration-promoting factors on muscle function...|$|R
40|$|No {{controlled}} {{studies have}} been conducted to determine the predilection muscles of Trichinella zimbabwensis larvae in Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) or the influence of infection intensity on the distribution of the larvae in crocodiles. The distribution of larvae in muscles of naturally infected Nile crocodiles and experimentally infected caimans (Caiman crocodilus) and varans (Varanus exanthematicus) have been reported in literature. To determine the distribution patterns of T. zimbabwensis larvae and predilection muscles, 15 crocodiles were randomly divided into three cohorts of five animals each, representing high infection (642 larvae/kg of bodyweight average), medium infection (414 larvae/kg of bodyweight average) and low infection (134 larvae/kg of bodyweight average) cohorts. In the high infection cohort, high percentages of larvae were observed in the triceps muscles (26 %) and <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> (13 %). In the medium infection cohort, high percentages of larvae were found in the triceps muscles (50 %), sternomastoid (18 %) and <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> (13 %). In the low infection cohort, larvae were mainly found in the intercostal muscles (36 %), longissimus complex (27 %), forelimb muscles (20 %) and <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> (10 %). Predilection muscles in the high and medium infection cohorts were similar to those reported in naturally infected crocodiles despite changes in infection intensity. The high infection cohort had significantly higher numbers of larvae in the sternomastoid, triceps, intercostal, longissimus complex, external tibial flexor, longissimus caudalis and caudal femoral muscles (p < 0. 05) compared with the medium infection cohort. In comparison with the low infection cohort, the high infection cohort harboured significantly higher numbers of larvae in all muscles (p < 0. 05) except for the tongue. The high infection cohort harboured significantly higher numbers of larvae (p < 0. 05) in the sternomastoid, triceps, intercostal, longissimus complex, external tibial flexor, longissimus caudalis and caudal femoral muscles compared with naturally infected crocodiles. Results from this study show that, in Nile crocodiles, larvae of T. zimbabwensis appear first to invade predilection muscles closest to their release site in the small intestine before occupying those muscles situated further away. The recommendation for the use of masseter, pterygoid and intercostal muscles as sampling sites for the detection of T. zimbabwensis in crocodiles is in contrast to the results from this study, where the fore- and <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> had the highest number of larvae. This study also supports the use of biopsy sampling from the dorso-lateral regions of the tail for surveillance purposes in both wild and commercial crocodile populations...|$|R

In this study, we investigated whether transplantation of freshly isolated bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) alleviates neuropathic pain in the early stage of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Two weeks after STZ injection, BM-MNCs or vehicle saline were injected into the unilateral <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles.</b> Mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in SD rats were measured {{as the number of}} foot withdrawals to von Frey hair stimulation and acetone application, respectively. Two weeks after the BM-MNC transplantation, sciatic motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sciatic nerve blood flow (SNBF), mRNA expressions and histology were assessed. The BM-MNC transplantation significantly ameliorated mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in the BM-MNC-injected side. Furthermore, the slowed MNCV/SNCV and decreased SNBF in diabetic rats were improved in the BM-MNC-injected side. BM-MNC transplantation improved the decreased mRNA expression of NT- 3 and number of microvessels in the <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles.</b> There was no distinct effect of BM-MNC transplantation on the intraepidermal nerve fiber density.

By application of an alternative approach, we identified 63 transcripts with differences in two muscles and 5 genes differing between the groups in three muscles. The expression of six selected genes (SQSTM 1, SSRP 1, DDIT 4, ENAH, MAF, and PDK 4) was investigated with SYBRGreen RT - Real time PCR. The differences obtained with the microarray analysis could be confirmed and demonstrate the validity of the alternative approach to microarray data analysis. Four genes with different expression levels in at least two muscles (SQSTM 1, SSRP 1, DDIT 4, and MAF) are assigned to transcriptional cascades related to cell death and may thus indicate pathways for further investigations on congenital splay leg in piglets. </p...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{for performance}} has resulted in distinct breeds of horse, such as the Quarter Horse (bred for acceleration) and the Arab (bred for endurance). Rapid acceleration, seen during Quarter Horse racing, requires fast powerful muscular contraction and the generation of large joint torques, particularly by the <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles.</b> This study compared hind limb moment arm lengths in the Quarter Horse and Arab. We hypothesized that Quarter Horse <b>hind</b> limb extensor <b>muscles</b> would have longer moment arms {{when compared to the}} Arab, conferring a greater potential for torque generation at the hip, stifle and tarsus during limb extension. Six Quarter Horse and six Arab hind limbs were dissected to determine muscle moment arm lengths for the following muscles: gluteus medius, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius (medialis and lateralis) and tibialis cranialis. The moment arms of biceps femoris (acting at the hip) and gastrocnemius lateralis (acting at the stifle) were significantly longer in the Quarter Horse, although the length of the remaining muscle moment arms were similar in both breeds of horse. All the Quarter Horse muscles were capable of generating greater muscle moments owing to their greater physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and therefore greater isometric force potential, which suggests that PCSA is a better determinant of muscle torque than moment arm length in these two breeds of horse. With the exception of gastrocnemius and tibialis cranialis, the observed muscle fascicle length to moment arm ratio (MFL : MA ratio) was greater for the Arab horse muscles. It appears that the Arab muscles have the potential to operate at slower velocities of contraction and hence generate greater force outputs when compared to the Quarter Horse muscles working over a similar range of joint motion; this would indicate that Arab <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles</b> are optimized to function at maximum economy rather than maximum power output...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cutaneous tactile allodynia, or painful {{hypersensitivity}} to mechanical {{stimulation of}} the skin, is typically associated with neuropathic pain, although also present in chronic pain patients {{who do not have}} evidence of nerve injury. We examine whether deep tissue microvascular dysfunction, a feature common in chronic non-neuropathic pain, contributes to allodynia. Results Persistent cutaneous allodynia is produced in rats following a hind paw ischemia-reperfusion injury that induces microvascular dysfunction, including arterial vasospasms and capillary slow flow/no-reflow, in muscle. Microvascular dysfunction leads to persistent muscle ischemia, a reduction of intraepidermal nerve fibers, and allodynia correlated with muscle ischemia, but not with skin nerve loss. The affected <b>hind</b> paw <b>muscle</b> shows lipid peroxidation, an upregulation of nuclear factor kappa B, and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines, while allodynia is relieved by agents that inhibit these alterations. Allodynia is increased, along with <b>hind</b> paw <b>muscle</b> lactate, when these rats exercise, and is reduced by an acid sensing ion channel antagonist. Conclusion Our results demonstrate how microvascular dysfunction and ischemia in muscle can {{play a critical role in}} the development of cutaneous allodynia, and encourage the study of how these mechanisms contribute to chronic pain.

40|$|Background: p-aminobenzamidine (p-ABA) {{is used as}} a ligand in the {{purification}} of many serine proteases and {{in their}} removal from heterogeneous samples. Moreover, p-ABA has a potent ability to bind Ca 2 +-binding proteins. The binding ability and use of p-ABA in purification processes is still not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: A p-Aminobenzamidine (p-ABA) ligand enabled the purification of the panallergenic proteins tropomyosin and paramyosin, as well as actin, tubulin, troponin and several kinases and annexins, with variable specificity depending on the tissue source and slight modifications to the purification process. The high affinity of p-ABA to tropomyosin, paramyosin, actin, troponin and myosin is calcium-dependent, since calcium regulates the function of these proteins. In addition, p-ABA probably simulates phosphorylated serine and therefore purified appropriate kinases. Because p-ABA binds to calcium-dependent proteins, and probably those with binding sites containing serine, it is not a suitable inhibitor of proteolysis during the purification of such proteins. p-ABA is widely used to inhibit proteases during protein purification processes, but it is used in columns here to purify nonprotease proteins. Two strategies were applied; the first was the inactivation of proteases that were not of interest using protease inhibitors. The second strategy employed was the use of a Ca 2 + wash solution to remove calciumdependent proteins. The removal of calcium-dependent proteins from rabbit <b>hind</b> <b>muscle</b> pointed out even mor...|$|R

Acute in vivo injection of dystrophic mdx mice (30 mg/kg, s. c.) fully counteracted calpain overactivity in diaphragm. A chronic 4 – 6 weeks administration significantly prevented in vivo the fore limb force drop occurring in mdx mice exercised on treadmill. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that BN 82270 treatment contrasted {{the decrease in}} chloride channel function (gCl) in diaphragm, an index of spontaneous degeneration, while it was less effective on both exercise-impaired gCl and calcium-dependent mechanical threshold of the hind limb extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle fibres.

In longitudinally cut muscle fibers, many fluorescent dots, but not all, corresponded to the sarcomere pattern, especially the I band. Sec...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Attachment of {{circulating}} {{tumor cells}} to endothelial cell adhesion molecules restricted to select vascular compartments {{is thought to}} be responsible for site-specific metastasis. Lung-metastatic rat R 3230 AC-MET breast and RPC- 2 prostate carcinoma cells bound outside-out endothelial cell membrane vesicles, prepared by perfusion of the rat lung vasculature with a low-strength formaldehyde solution, in significantly higher numbers than their nonmetastatic counterparts R 3230 AC-LR and RPC-LR. In contrast, vesicles derived from the vasculature of a nonmetastasized organ (e. g., <b>hind</b> leg <b>muscle)</b> showed no binding preference for either of the four tumor cell lines. Lung-derived endothelial vesicles were used here to generate mAbs against lung endothelial cell adhesion molecules. Th...|$|R
40|$|The <b>hind</b> leg <b>muscles</b> of {{dystrophic}} mice (C 57 BL dy 2 J/dy 2 J) wer chronically stimulated at 10 Hz for 30 minutes {{six times}} a day. After 14 days of such activity a clinical improvement {{in the use of}} the stimulated leg was noticed. The twitch and tetanic tensions developed by the stimulated tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles were higher than those developed by the control, unstimulated muscles on the contralateral side. Histochemically visualised activity of the oxidative enzyme succinic dehydrogenase was greater in fibres of the stimulated muscles. The stimulated muscles contained more muscle fibres than unstimulated controls. It is concluded that slow frequency activity has a beneficial effect on muscles of dystrophic mice...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Dr. Silvio Renesto {{described}} a specimen discovered in Switzerland which preserved the impressions {{of skin and}} other soft tissue. Renesto interpreted this specimen as supporting the hypothesis that Tanystropheus lived along the shoreline, snatching fish and other marine life from the shallows with its long neck and sharp teeth. The specimen displayed an unusual [...] "black material" [...] {{around the base of}} the tail, containing several calcium carbonate spherules, suggesting a quite noticeable amount of muscle behind the animal's hips. In addition to containing powerful <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles,</b> this unusually large muscle mass would have shifted the animal's weight to its rear, stabilizing the animal as it swung and maneuvered its massive neck.|$|R
40|$|No {{clear data}} is {{available}} about functional alterations in the calcium-dependent excitation-contraction (e-c) coupling mechanism of dystrophin-deficient muscle of mdx mice. By {{means of the}} intracellular microelectrode ‘point' voltage clamp method, we measured the voltage threshold for contraction (mechanical threshold; MT) in intact extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle fibres of dystrophic mdx mouse of two different ages: 8 – 12 weeks, during the active regeneration of <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles,</b> and 6 – 8 months, when regeneration is complete. The EDL muscle fibres of 8 – 12 -week-old wildtype animals had a more negative rheobase voltage (potential of equilibrium for contraction- and relaxation-related calcium movements) with respect to control mice of 6 – 8 months. However, at both ages, the EDL muscle fibres of mdx mice contracted at more negative potentials with respect to age-matched controls and had markedly slower time constants to reach the rheobase. The in vitro application of 60 [*]mM taurine, whose normally high intracellular muscle levels {{play a role in}} e-c coupling, was without effect on 6 – 8 -month-old wildtype EDL muscle, while it significantly ameliorated the MT of mdx mouse. HPLC determination of taurine content at 6 – 8 months showed a significant 140 % rise of plasma taurine levels and a clear trend toward a decrease in amino acid levels in <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscles,</b> brain and heart, suggesting a tissue difficulty in retaining appropriate levels of the amino acid. The data is consistent with a permanent alteration of e-c coupling in mdx EDL muscle fibres. The alteration could be related to the proposed increase in intracellular calcium, and can be ameliorated by taurine, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of the amino acid...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Through S 1 {{nuclease}} mapping using {{a specific}} cDNA probe, we {{demonstrate that the}} slow myosin heavy-chain (MHC) gene, characteristic of adult soleus, is expressed in bulk <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscle</b> obtained from the 18 -d rat fetus. We support these results by use of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) which is highly specific to the adult slow MHC. Immunoblots of MHC peptide maps show the same peptides, uniquely recognized by this antibody in adult soleus, are also identified in 18 -d fetal limb muscle. Thus synthesis of slow myosin is an early event in skeletal myogenesis and is expressed concurrently with embryonic myosin. By immunofluorescence we demonstrate that in the 16 -d fetus all primary myotubes in future fast and futur...|$|R
40|$|Although {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) knockout mice survive, {{they have}} abnormal neuromuscular function. We analysed further {{the effects of}} the mutation on <b>hind</b> limb <b>muscle</b> contractile properties. Tibialis anterior muscle from AChE KO mice is unable to maintain tension during a short period of repetitive nerve stimulation (tetanic fade) and has an increased twitch tension in response to a single nerve electric stimulation. In response to direct muscle stimulation, we found that maximal velocity of shortening of soleus muscle is increased and maximum tetanic force is decreased in AchE KO mice versus control animals. As the contractile properties of the soleus muscle were altered by AChE ablation, our results suggest cellular and molecular changes in AChE ablated muscle containing both fast and slow muscle fibres...|$|R
40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the profile of}} fatty acids in <b>hind</b> leg <b>muscle</b> of 18 female and 12 male nutria reared on an extensive system farm in eastern Poland with a diet based on fresh forage. When compared to results from nutrias from an intensive production system from the literature, the forage-fed animals had lower proportions of saturated fatty acids, and higher proportions of n 3 -fatty acids in their muscle tissue; in particular, n 6 :n 3 -fatty acid ratios were lower (2. 6 – 3. 0) in forage-fed animals compared to intensively reared animals (16. 8 – 28. 9). These findings underline that using forage-based diets is feasible in nutrias, and an economic way to improve the fatty acid composition of their meat...|$|R
40|$|An eight {{year old}} female spayed Rottweiler mixed breed dog {{presented}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Internal Medicine Service for evaluation of a previously diagnosed case of inflammatory bowel disease. The diagnosis {{was the result of}} full thickness biopsies taken of the small intestine during a previous exploratory laparotomy. They had made a histologic diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis with granulomatous regions consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. Immunosuppressive therapy was undergone at the time (Prednisone and Azathioprine). At the time of presentation at Cornell (3 / 15 / 11), the patient was exhibiting severe ascites, edematous hind limbs with severe pitting edema in the right <b>hind,</b> <b>muscle</b> wasting, and labored breathing with shortened breaths. Other clinical signs included intermittent diarrhea and anorexia, lethargy, and the inability to rise on her own due to the severe ascites. The results of numerous diagnostic tests indicated that the patient was exhibiting protein loss due to a severe protein losing enteropathy. Re-cuts of the previously taken biopsies (evaluated at Cornell) also showed a lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis as well as lymphangiectasia and lymphangitis. Medical therapy was altered and a treatment protocol was begun that included immunosuppressive drugs, antibiotics, diuretics, and vitamin supplements. Nutritional recommendations were to start a home-cooked, novel protein, highly digestible, low fat diet. This diet would help lower the antigen load to decrease inflammatory response as well as decrease the dilatation of lymphatic vessels due to its fat restriction. Within two weeks following treatment, the patient had responded with decreased peritoneal fluid, resolution of edema, the ability to rise and ambulate normally, as well as regaining a normal appetite with a decrease of clinical signs. The prognosis remains variable based on the response to treatment, which will continue to be monitored closely...|$|R
