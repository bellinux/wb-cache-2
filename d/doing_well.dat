5|$|These {{concerns}} were soon partially allayed. With {{the global economy}} <b>doing</b> <b>well,</b> China was able to abandon its dollar peg in 2005, allowing a substantial appreciation of the Yuan up to 2007, while still increasing its exports. The dollar peg was later re-established as the financial crises began to reduce China's export orders.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E

5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E

Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

5|$|Theme Park offers {{three levels}} of simulation: the higher {{difficulties}} requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player is judged on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff can be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for <b>doing</b> <b>well,</b> and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.|$|E

Urging Homer and Marge to enforce stronger discipline on Bart {{with the idea}} that he could grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice if he turns his life around, the two return home to find that Bart stole and broke Grampa's false teeth. Therefore, Bart is sent up to his room without dinner as punishment, but Homer sneaks up and brings him some pizza, making Bart promise to behave. However, Bart continues to get in trouble and Homer's attempts to discipline him fail. Eventually he promises Marge to make the next punishment stick.|$|E

5|$|On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles {{took over}} the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the {{development}} of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again <b>doing</b> <b>well.</b> Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting software developer in 1960. The software division was <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues.|$|E
5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides {{something has to be done}} ("Thinkin' "). He is unable to come up with an answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they felt, they replied they were <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the poem {{parallels}} the Iliad and follows the events in America after the first part. Madoc returns to America from Wales and finds that Caermadoc, the colony, is <b>doing</b> <b>well.</b> However, there are struggles with his people and the Aztecs because the Aztecs have turned back to their pagan gods. As such, the peace between the two groups ends while a shaman of the Hoamen people starts to convince the people to also worship pagan gods. The Hoamen begin to sacrifice children for their god by feeding them to a large snake. Madoc, angry, accuses a priest leading the sacrifices of being a traitor before killing both the priest and the snake. This feat brings the Hoamen back to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{competed in}} road races and time trials, and {{off-road}} in cross country, in several world championships. She was not {{selected for the}} New Zealand road cycling team for the 1992 Olympics. She believed that omitting her was a mistake and intended to prove it by <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> at that year's Tour de France Féminin. She placed sixth in that race and demonstrated her good form. In 1992, she entered the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in the veteran category and won bronze in both the cross country and the downhill events. When it was announced in 1994 that mountain biking was to become an Olympic discipline, Lynch's focus turned to being picked for the New Zealand team. For that reason, she swapped from the veteran class to elite at the world championships. She became New Zealand's first representative in an Olympic mountain biking event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Aged 39, she was the oldest competitor in the event, but managed to achieve eighth place, leaving two previous world champions behind her. She retired from serious competition after the Olympics, {{with the exception of}} the first UCI World Cup in April 1997 that was held in New Zealand. Until her mid-40s, she competed at the top level in adventure racing. During her domestic career, Lynch won many national titles, and was a serial winner at premium events such as the Karapoti Classic and the Coast to Coast.|$|E
