5|$|Like most of Saturn's larger satellites, Enceladus rotates {{synchronously}} {{with its}} orbital period, keeping one face pointed toward Saturn. Unlike Earth's Moon, Enceladus {{does not appear}} to librate more than 1.5° about its spin axis. However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit libration. This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.|$|E
5|$|The Mink {{fire started}} in Bridger-Teton National Forest from {{lightning}} on July 11, and burned north following the Yellowstone River valley, after firefighters forced the fire away from private lands. The Mink fire eventually burned sections {{inside the park}} after July 23, but was deemed to be a low risk since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very remote section of the park.|$|E
5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built just inside the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an enclosed area) was added {{in front of the}} castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, an {{economic}} or financial policy is called countercyclical {{if it works}} against the cyclical tendencies in the economy. That is, countercyclical policies are ones that cool down the economy when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> upswing, and stimulate the economy when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> downturn.|$|R

5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Eighteenth Dynasty, only kings were buried within the valley in large tombs. When a non-royal person was buried, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master. Amenhotep III's tomb was {{constructed}} in the Western Valley, and while his son Akhenaten moved his tomb's construction to Amarna, it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him. With the return to religious orthodoxy {{at the end of the}} Eighteenth Dynasty, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb returned to the royal necropolis.|$|E
5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E

It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over many years. In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff.|$|E

She returned to Fremantle on 21 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E

5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} the Earls of Richmond until 1322, by when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor state of repair. Edward II then gave Bowes Castle to John de Scargill instead; the local tenants of the Earl of Richmond rebelled and attacked the castle. The lord of the castle was away at the time, and the attackers burnt part of a hall, drank four tuns of wine and stole armour, springalds and other goods. Conflict with Scotland led to further raids against the castle and the surrounding manor; the neighbouring fields were abandoned as a result and by 1340 the castle was in ruins and the manor worth nothing.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E

5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum told him it was best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move from one place to another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned {{at the start of}} William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E
