The three Arctic islands discovered during the expedition, plus two others discovered {{a few years}} later, form an archipelago that bears the name Ostrova De Longa; despite Melville's planting of the American flag, the islands <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been accepted as Russian territory.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea <b>have</b> <b>always</b> worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea <b>have</b> <b>always</b> worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Hoffmann did as most chemists <b>have</b> <b>always</b> done, {{starting}} by studying the literature and recreating the published methods.

25|$|Ball {{tampering}} <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been {{a feature}} of the sport. Players would use objects to rough up one side of the ball, and use resins and substances like Brylcreem to shine the other.

Despite this, it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> gone on with limited sanction, and {{it can be difficult to}} spot.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{defended the}} value of specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, {{has argued that the}} lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as Lives of the Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these {{are not part of the}} original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E
5|$|Children <b>have</b> <b>always</b> played games. It is {{accepted}} {{that as well}} as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children's Games, painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as marbles, hide-and-seek, blowing soap bubbles and piggyback riding continue to be played.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E

However, Brough did play some grade football in Brisbane, with Easts. Brough claims he got his love of rugby league from his grandfather who took him to the Brisbane grand final between Redcliffe (captained by Arthur Beetson) and Norths in 1965.|$|R

By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|Express trains {{operated}} by NSB <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{been the primary}} passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages along the line to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a night train service. Several {{parts of the line}} service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.|$|E

Although wool was once the primary income source for New Zealand sheep owners (especially during the New Zealand wool boom), today it has shifted to meat production for export.|$|E
