40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to measure the effect on employment, and other key {{economic}} variables, of worksharing policies, minimum wage variations and some other measures of flexibility in a special framework, based on Holden (1988) and Moene (1988), where two different levels of negotiations for both wages and hours take place and Capital Operating Time is adopted. Within our <b>framework,</b> <b>hours,</b> wages and employment are determined in a three stage process: in the first a tariff hourly wage and a standard work-week will be unilaterally negotiated by a central union; in the second, firms determine hours and employment prevailing until the next period, and finally in the third stage employers and local unions negotiate local hourly wage drift. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{build and}} {{parameterize}} a {{general equilibrium model}} with overlapping generations for an open economy to study and explain within one coherent <b>framework</b> <b>hours</b> of work in three age groups, education of the young, and per capita growth. The composition of fiscal policy plays a crucial role. The government sets tax rates on labor, capital and consumption. It allocates its revenue to productive expenditures (mainly for education), consumption and ‘non‐employment ’ benefits. Labor taxes and benefits may differ across age groups. We find that our fiscal policy model explains the facts remarkably well for all key variables in many OECD countries. Given the actual variation in fiscal policy composition, cross‐country differences in taste for leisure have very little role to play. We then use the model to investigate {{the strength of the}} effects of various fiscal policy shocks on steady state employment per age group and growth. We identify ‘non‐employment ’ benefits and labor taxes as the main policy variables affecting employment. Effects are the strongest when policy measures focus on older workers. Productive government expenditures are the most effective with respect to growth. Growth may benefit also from labor tax cuts targeted at older workers. By contrast, tax cuts targeted at younger workers tend to imply lower growth...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{debate the}} effect of a {{permanent}} productivity shock on hours per capita within a structural VAR context. This paper examines the issue using a correlated unobserved components (UC) framework. The estimates show that permanent shocks to productivity are negatively correlated with transitory shocks to hours. This result is robust for non-stationary, levels stationary and differenced stationary specifications of hours. A comparison of the UC framework to the structural VAR framework shows that the UC <b>framework</b> with <b>hours</b> in levels performs better.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of decentralised bargaining, {{the weakening of}} the award system and {{the erosion of the}} regulatory <b>framework</b> protecting <b>hours</b> of work is part of a new managerial offensive aimed at dismantling standardised working time and drive down costs. Under the guise of progressive ìflexibilityî, hard-won protective standards and conditions around working time are being eroded and increasingly replaced with individualised arrangements all designed to intensify work. These new arrangements can be described as the ìmanagerialisationî 1 of working time; and are having profound implications for the durationand distribution of working hours, the scheduling of working hours and the pace of work. Significantly, the eight hour day seems a quaint phenomenon of the past. This paper examines the emerging phenomenon of the longer workday and in particular, the 12 hour workday and the impact of decentralised bargaining...|$|R

We establish {{a set of}} facts concerning the variability of unemployment and vacancies in the aggregate {{and the distribution of}} net employment growth and the comovement of hours and employment growth at the establishment level. A search model with non-convex costs of posting vacancies, establishment-level profitability shocks and a contracting <b>framework</b> to set <b>hours</b> provides a structure to understand these observations. The estimated model is able to capture both the aggregate and establishment-level facts...|$|R
40|$|Several {{techniques}} can be retrieved in literature, which {{cope with the}} problem of energy load forecasting in the short-term <b>framework,</b> that is <b>hours</b> up to few days ahead. However, in order to properly schedule operative conditions including e- nergy purchasing and generation, fuel supply, and infrastruc- ture development and maintenance, a long-term prediction is of crucial importance. In this framework, the generaliza- tion of the short-term techniques to this more complex prob- lem is usually characterized by a scarce performance. In this paper, we present an innovative method, which exploits the Savitzky-Golay filter and the Support Vector Regression al- gorithm in order to reliably predict the energy consumption in the long-term framework: the extrapolation ability of our proposal is validated on a real-world problem...|$|R
40|$|Fulcra is a {{flexible}} and accurate pointer analysis framework. The algorithms developed permit accurate analysis of programs within SPEC and Mediabench benchmark suites generally within {{a small number}} of seconds. Even when a very detailed heap allocation model is used, the longest analysis time is 5 min, while similar <b>frameworks</b> require <b>hours</b> or months. Furthermore, comparisons of accuracy show that the algorithms developed for Fulcra can provide orders of magnitude difference between the least and most accurate analysis configurations. While the implementation is exciting, the author’s primary goal is not to laud its speed or accuracy, but to provide a guide to designers in how to construct very flexible pointer analysis frameworks. For example, the algorithms developed for Fulcra enable control of context sensitivity, field sensitivity, and heap sensitivity at the granularity of a single program object. It is only through this flexibility that frameworks can hope to find a true balance between accuracy and scalability capable of satisfying the timeliness demanded by some clients with the result quality demanded by others. The contributions of Fulcra center around its whole-hearted embrace of hybrid pointer analysis algorithms and the design of elegant qualified constraint-based algorithms that enable simple, flexible, and accurate approachs to context and heap sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} argues that {{reducing the number}} of hours worked by the employed would lead to lower unemployment, since firms will respond by hiring more workers. This paper examines the relationship between hours worked and unemployment, {{in the context of an}} efficiency wage model where involuntary unemployment occurs owing to imperfect monitoring of worker effort. The first part of the paper presents a partial equilibrium model where the number of hours worked per week is determined exogenously. The model makes standard assumptions about effort costs (i. e., increasing marginal disutility of work), and also allows for the presence of daily 'set-up costs' for the worker. It is shown that under these assumptions the equilibrium level of unemployment, viewed as a function of hours worked, is 'U-shaped' (or simply increasing, if the set-up costs are zero). The paper then moves to a general equilibrium <b>framework</b> where <b>hours</b> are determined endogenously; it is shown that in this case the free market choice of hours is always greater than the unemployment-minimizing level, so that 'work-sharing' could indeed lower unemployment. However the paper also presents a powerful and surprising welfare result: conditional on being unemployed, a representative worker is always best off under the free market outcome. Nonetheless, starting from the free market equilibrium there is always an hours-reduction policy which reduces unemployment and increases the expected utility of a currently unemployed worker. The currently employed are always made worse off by such a policy. ...|$|R
40|$|Using data on {{a cohort}} of British women who were born in 1958, this paper investigates the effects of qualifications, {{household}} structure and family background on the occupational penalty suffered by women in part-time employment. The analysis is conducted using a dynamic multinomial modelling <b>framework</b> in which <b>hours</b> of work and occupational attainment are jointly determined. The results reveal that {{at the bottom of}} the occupational hierarchy degree level qualifications improve the occupational attainment of women in part-time employment relative to that of women working full-time. In contrast, at top of the occupational hierarchy, degree level qualifications benefit full-timers more than part-timers. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, women with children have higher occupational attainment than childless women thus suggesting that women with children are relatively selective in terms of the jobs they are willing to accept. Furthermore, women with children experience a smaller part-time occupational penalty than childless women. Family background effects are present but small...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Cold-stored arteries {{function}} well as microvascular autografts, {{but little}} is known of the morphologic changes that occur in them during cold storage or of further changes during reperfusion. Methods: In part A of the study, rabbit femoral arteries were stored at 4 ° C for up to 6 months. In part B rabbit femoral arteries were stored at 4 ° C for up to 6 months, inserted as end-to-end autografts into contralateral femoral arteries, and reperfused for 24 hours. Tissue was examined by histologic study, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, histochemical study, immunohistochemical study, and tissue culture. Results: Cell viability declined gradually at 4 ° C, so that by 4 weeks no viable cells remained. However, the extracellular framework and elastic lamellae remain intact. If cold-stored arteries are reinserted as autografts for 24 hours, this accelerates breakdown of necrotic cells and reduces {{the thickness of the}} medial wall and internal elastic lamina but does not alter the extracellular framework. Conclusions: Cold storage results in acellular vascular grafts with intact extracellular <b>frameworks.</b> After 24 <b>hours</b> reperfusion there is no major change to the extracellular framework.

Traditional video analytics approaches are manual and time consuming. These are subjective due to the very involvement of human factor. We present a cloud based video analytics framework for scalable and robust analysis of video streams. The framework empowers an operator by automating the object {{detection and}} classification process from recorded video streams. An operator only specifies an analysis criteria and duration of video streams to analyse. The streams are then fetched from a cloud storage, decoded and analysed on the cloud. The framework executes compute intensive parts of the analysis to GPU powered servers in the cloud. Vehicle and face detection are presented as two case studies for evaluating the framework, with one month of data and a 15 node cloud. The framework reliably performed object detection and classification on the data, comprising of 21, 600 video streams and 175 GB in size, in 6. 52 hours. The GPU enabled deployment of the <b>framework</b> took 3 <b>hours</b> to perform analysis on the same number of video streams, thus making it at least twice as fast than the cloud deployment without GPUs...|$|R

There is little long-term data available on similar treatments in the edentulous maxilla. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the 12 -month implant survival after immediate loading of 4 to 6 implants with fixed screw-retained prostheses in edentulous maxillae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients, edentulous or with remaining teeth to be extracted in the maxilla, received 4 to 6 implants (n= 111). The patients were restored with screw-retained fixed provisional prostheses supported by palladium-alloy <b>frameworks</b> within 24 <b>hours</b> after surgery. Insertion torques for implants were at least 40 Ncm. Implants, grouped as tapered or cylindrical screws, were placed in healed bone or extraction sockets. Implants were also classified as either vertical or off-angle. Definitive prostheses were placed after a mean healing time of 18 weeks. Radiographic examinations were made at the time of placement of provisional prostheses and 12 months later. Between-groups bone resorption was compared using 2 -way ANOVA (alpha=. 05). RESULTS: The mean follow-up time for all of the patients was 20 months (range, 13 to 28 months). The cumulative implant survival rate at the 12 -month follow-up visits (after surgery) was 92. 8...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Swedish {{resident}} duty hour {{limit is}} regulated by Swedish and European legal frameworks. With a maximum average of 40 working hours per week, the Swedish duty hour regulation {{is one of}} the most restrictive in the world. At the same time, the effects of resident duty hour limits have been neither debated nor researched in the Swedish context. As a result, little is known about the Swedish conceptual framework for resident duty hours, their restriction, or their outcomes: we call this “the Swedish duty hour enigma. ” This situation poses a further question: How do Swedish residents themselves construct a conceptual <b>framework</b> for duty <b>hour</b> restrictions? Methods: A case study was conducted at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm – an urban, research-intensive hospital setting. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 34 residents currently in training in 6 specialties. The empirical data analysis relied on theoretical propositions and was conducted thematically using a pattern-matching technique. The interview guide was based on four main topics: the perceived effect of duty hour restrictions on (1) patient care, (2) resident education, (3) resident well-being, and (4) research. Results: The residents did not perceive the volume of duty hours to be the main determinant of success or failure in the four contextual domains of patient care, resident education, resident well-being, and research. Instead, the...|$|R
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{considers}} {{the problem of}} determining the extent of any state dependencies in women's labor supply behavior. Employment outcomes are modeled using a dynamic multinomial choice framework including persistent unobserved heterogeneity with a relatively general distribution. In order to ensure reliable parameter estimates, appropriate restrictions are imposed {{on the distribution of}} unobservables. Significant state dependence is present in both full-time and part-time employment. State dependencies are overestimated if persistent unobservables are ignored, and underestimated if an overly restrictive form of persistence is imposed. The second chapter investigates the effects of qualifications, household structure and family background on the occupational penalty suffered by women in part-time employment. The analysis uses a dynamic multinomial modeling <b>framework</b> in which <b>hours</b> of work and occupational attainment are jointly determined. At the bottom of the occupational hierarchy 'degree level qualifications improve the occupational attainment of women in part-time employment relative to that of women working full-time, while at top of the occupational hierarchy degree level qualifications benefit full-timers more than part-timers. Women with children have higher occupational attainment and experience a smaller parttime occupational penalty than childless women. The final chapter generalizes the standard labor supply model by allowing individuals' preferences to be defined over a variety of non-market time uses and an aggregate good. The labor supply behavior implied by this generalized model is compared to that suggested by a standard labor supply model. Estimates of wage elasticities and marginal effects are found to be sensitive to whether preferences are defined over total leisure or the separate components of leisure. The difference between the predictions of the two models is attributed to a combination of the effect of individual heterogeneity and the presence of corner solutions for the time allocated to several non-market activities.

40|$|Walter Kennedy {{was born}} c. 1460 and died c. 1518 (a later date than {{previously}} suggested), {{belonged to a}} family prominent in Scottish affairs, moved in the King's circle and was famed in his own day as a poet. [...] He {{is best known for}} his share in "The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie" but his extant corpus also includes The Passioun of Crist (1, 715 lines) and four lyrics. He was edited by David Laing, in the second volume of The Poems of William Dunbar, Edinburgh, 1834, but only 371 lines of The Passioun were included; and by Jacob Schipper in The Poems of Walter Kennedy, Vienna, 1901, who did not include "The Flyting," having earlier edited it in his William Dunbar - Sein Leben und seine Gedichte, Berlin, 1884. A fresh study of Walter Kennedy is overdue; he is one of the Scottish Makars who deserves notice. [...] All of Kennedy's poetry is in stanza form. He shows mastery in producing variety by using internal rhyme and alliteration. He has a wide range of diction and style. The lyrics and The Passioun of Crist are on religious themes, while "The Flyting" is a contest in invective and poetic techniques. [...] In this study the lyrics are shown in relation to Lydgate, Henryson and Dunbar and against the background of their time. Kennedy's treatment of his topics is often original. "The Flyting" is viewed as a formal contest between friends rather than as an outpouring of scurrility against enemies in which Kennedy is a worthy opponent, exhibiting a wide range of language and poetical skills. [...] The Passioun of Crist is judged to be not merely a narration of the sufferings of our Lord but a much more complex poem where several elements are skilfully blended. Following a Proloque the poem begins with a survey from the creation of man to the events immediately leading to the Crucifixion. The central part of the poem, which recounts the Passion and the Resurrection of Christ, is set within the <b>framework</b> of canonical <b>Hours,</b> beginning on the Wednesday of Holy Week. It is shown that the section for 'sext' which includes, along with the narrative, lyrical laments, a sermon and a conversation between the Virgin and the Cross, coincides with the midday service on Good Friday and that the poem in many ways, including much use of direct speech, bears a strong resemblance to a liturgical drama or Passion play which has had a Prologue added to introduce it to readers. Kennedy's skill in using various metrical and rhetorical devices to avoid monotony through 245 stanzas is demonstrated...|$|R
