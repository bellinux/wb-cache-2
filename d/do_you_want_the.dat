[...] The political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh noted that this question was often mocked for its [...] "unrealistic ambiguity", and some journalists referred to Goldsmith's venture as the [...] "Referendum Only Party". Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was [...] "wholly agnostic" [...] about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue. However, the wording of the party's main question led one group of political scientists to note that it [...] "clearly revealed Goldsmith's Eurosceptic colours" [...] and that the wider pronouncements of the party became increasingly Eurosceptic as time went on.|$|E
