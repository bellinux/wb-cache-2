60|$|Caleb {{wanted to}} go too; but his <b>grandmother</b> <b>said</b> it would not do very well, for he could {{not keep up with}} Raymond; and besides, she said that she wanted him. So Caleb went out with Raymond under the great elm before the house, and pointed out the place among the rocks, where he had seen Cherry. She was not there then, at least she was not in sight; but Raymond knew that she could not have gone far from the place, so he walked down over the bridge, and soon disappeared.|$|E
