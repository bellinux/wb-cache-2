5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} estimating {{the number of}} riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per <b>day</b> (<b>by</b> June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a <b>day</b> (<b>by</b> June 1992).|$|E

5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the French Army {{remained}} the finest army of its <b>day</b> <b>by</b> a good margin. It {{had been the}} legacy of the French King and its fusion with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon's reforms had transformed it into a military machine that had dominated Europe since 1805. Each corps of the French Army was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action.|$|E

5|$|After Passover, {{the celebration}} of Mimouna takes place, a {{tradition}} brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa. In the evening, a feast of fruit, confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy. Most notably, the first leaven after Passover, a thin crepe called a mofletta, eaten with honey, syrup or jam, is served. The occasion is celebrated the following <b>day</b> <b>by</b> outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently.|$|E
5|$|An advance {{into the}} Mormal Forest was {{continued}} the next <b>day</b> <b>by</b> the 2nd Infantry Brigade but {{the capture of}} Le Quesnoy was the last major engagement of the war for the New Zealand Division.

5|$|An inquiry {{was held}} into {{widening}} the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a <b>day</b> <b>by</b> 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|E

5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation participating in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and other areas of the United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per <b>day</b> <b>by</b> 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E

Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's reign {{came to an}} end in 96 when he {{was assassinated}} by court officials. He was succeeded the same <b>day</b> <b>by</b> his advisor Nerva.
