5|$|The {{trials were}} plagued with serious engine trouble, {{culminating}} in the failure of an entire turbine on 2 November. Moreno was forced to put in at Rockland, Maine—where many of the observers on board were left to be brought back by train to Camden—before proceeding for repairs to the Fore River Shipyard, which <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> ship's engines.|$|E
5|$|While admitting {{none of the}} {{defendants}} {{were involved in the}} bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. The defendants claimed they had no knowledge of the bomber at all.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{remained}} in royal hands {{until it was}} given to John Dudley in 1553. Dudley came to prominence under Henry VIII and became the leading political figure under Edward VI. Dudley was a patron of John Shute, an early exponent of classical architecture in England, and began the process of modernising Kenilworth. Before his execution in 1553 by Queen Mary for attempting to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, Dudley <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> new stable block and widened the tiltyard to its current form.|$|E
5|$|This {{section was}} named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the {{construction}} workers who <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'. Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Parsons {{met with}} Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, {{and it was}} agreed that Caltech would build and operate the plant. A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come. Complicating the construction program was the fact that Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used.|$|E

5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
5|$|Officially ordered on 2 November 1911 {{and laid}} down {{less than a}} month later on 27 November, the first {{dreadnought}} became the largest ship that Armstrong <b>had</b> <b>built.</b> <b>The</b> second dreadnought was ordered on 29 July 1912 and laid down on 22 January 1913, delayed by Rio de Janeiro occupying the slipway in which it would be built. The New York Tribune (2 November 1913) and Proceedings (May and June 1914) reported that Greece had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship counterbalance the Ottoman Empire's acquisition of Rio de Janeiro from Brazil, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell {{one or both of the}} dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1889 a {{demonstration}} train comprising two carriages and two locomotives {{ran along the}} newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension {{and representatives of the}} local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet run through to Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to the contractors who <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of the demonstration train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who had ridden the demonstration train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham.|$|E

Art, dance and music concerts are held annually during the months of September and December (Tamil calendar month – Margazhi). Coimbatore also houses a number of museums and art galleries like G.D.

5|$|Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A {{number of}} foreign players were signed, {{including}} Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989–90 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994–95 season second-bottom, and {{had to rely on}} a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt {{for the first time in}} its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} six {{official}} residences of Indiana's governors since Indiana became a state, but only five were actually inhabited {{by the first}} family. There were four other unofficial residences that governors also lived in while no other accommodations were available. The first residence of a state governor was in Corydon on a small hill overlooking the first statehouse; Governor Jonathan Jennings and his wife Anne lived in it from 1816 until 1822. The home was visited by United States Presidents Andrew Jackson and James Monroe. The building is no longer standing but a new home has been built upon its original foundation and uses its cellar as a basement. Governor William Hendricks also lived in Corydon at Governor Hendricks Headquarters, an unofficial residence purchased by Hendricks from Davis Floyd and located on the same block as Jennings' home. Floyd <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> home for himself, but lost it after the Panic of 1819. Hendricks lived there during his term as governor, from 18221825, and later sold it.|$|E
