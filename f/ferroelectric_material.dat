Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.|$|E

An electret is a <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>material</b> that has been permanently electrically charged or polarized. The name comes from electrostatic and magnet; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} ferroelectric materials {{can be used}} to make capacitors with tunable capacitance. Typically, a ferroelectric capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>material.</b> The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only tunable but commonly also very high in absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.|$|E

2500|$|Capacitance {{of ceramic}} {{capacitors}} may also change with applied voltage. This effect is {{more prevalent in}} class 2 ceramic capacitors. [...] The <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>material</b> depends on the applied voltage. The higher the applied voltage, the lower the permittivity. Capacitance measured or applied with higher voltage can drop to values of -80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0V. This behavior is a small source of nonlinearity in low-distortion filters and other analog applications. In audio applications this can be the reason for harmonic distortions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} electric dipoles of a <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>material</b> are {{coupled to}} the material lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change {{the strength of the}} dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization). [...] The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge. [...] This can cause current flow {{in the case of a}} ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called piezoelectricity. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called pyroelectricity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ferroelectric}} memristor {{is based}} on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two metallic electrodes. Switching the polarization of the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>material</b> by applying a positive or negative voltage across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation: [...] (an effect called Tunnel Electro-Resistance). In general, the polarization does not switch abruptly. The reversal occurs gradually through the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains with opposite polarization. During this process, the resistance is neither RON or ROFF, but in between. When the voltage is cycled, the ferroelectric domain configuration evolves, allowing a fine tuning of the resistance value. The ferroelectric memristor's main advantages are that ferroelectric domain dynamics can be tuned, offering a way to engineer the memristor response, and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena, aiding device reliability, as no deep change to the material structure is involved.|$|E
2500|$|Ferroelectric phase {{transitions}} {{are often}} characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO3) or order-disorder (such as NaNO2), though often phase transitions will demonstrate {{elements of both}} behaviors. In barium titanate, a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can {{be understood in terms}} of a polarization catastrophe, in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local electric fields due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring forces. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in barium titanate concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage. [...] In lead titanate, another key <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>material,</b> although the structure is rather similar to barium titanate the driving force for ferroelectricity is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.|$|E
