"Good {{engineering}} practice" [...] or [...] "GEP" [...] is {{engineering and}} technical activities that {{ensure that a}} company manufactures products of the required quality as expected (e.g., by the relevant regulatory authorities). <b>Good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practices</b> are {{to ensure that the}} development and/or manufacturing effort consistently generates deliverables that support the requirements for qualification or validation. <b>Good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practices</b> are applied to all industries that require engineering.|$|R

50|$|An edge {{case can}} be {{expected}} or unexpected. In engineering, the process of planning for and gracefully addressing edge cases can be a significant task, and one that may be overlooked or underestimated. Non-trivial edge cases {{can result in a}} failure of the object being engineered that may not have been imagined during the design phase or anticipated as possible during normal use. For this reason, attempts to formalize <b>good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practices</b> often incorporate information about dealing with edge cases.|$|R
50|$|In {{any case}} it is a <b>good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practice</b> to keep the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive low enough to avoid the self heating of the strain gauge.

50|$|In early systems, it {{was common}} to avoid the use of {{adjacent}} tones. On channels where every available tone is not in use, this is <b>good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practice.</b> For example, an ideal would be to avoid using 97.4 Hz and 100.0 Hz on the same channel. The tones are so close that some decoders may periodically false trigger. The user occasionally hears a syllable or two of co-channel users on a different CTCSS tone talking. As electronic components age, or through production variances, some radios in a system may be better than others at rejecting nearby tone frequencies.|$|E

5000|$|Operation on {{frequencies}} {{above or}} below the citizens band (on the [...] "uppers" [...] or [...] "lowers") is called [...] "freebanding" [...] or [...] "outbanding". [...] While frequencies just below the CB segment (or between the CB segment and the amateur radio 10-meter band) seem quiet and under-utilized, they are allocated to other radio services (including government agencies) and unauthorized operation on them is illegal. Furthermore, illegal transmitters and amplifiers may not meet <b>good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practice</b> for harmonic distortion or [...] "splatter", which may disrupt other communications and make the unapproved equipment obvious to regulators. Freebanding is done with modified CB or amateur equipment, foreign CB radios which may offer different channels, or with radios intended for export. Legal operation in one country may be illegal in another; for example, in the UK until June 2014 only 80 FM channels were legal.|$|E

50|$|The Christie tank {{embodied}} {{the ability to}} operate both on tracks and on large, solid-rubber-tired bogie wheels. The tracks were removable to permit operation on wheels over moderate terrain. Also featured was a suspension system of independently sprung wheels. The Christie had many advantages, including the amazing ability, in 1929, to attain speeds of 69 miles per hour on wheels and 42 miles per hour on tracks, although at these speeds the tank could not carry full equipment. To the infantry and cavalry the Christie was the best answer to their need for a fast, lightweight tank, and they were enthusiastic about its convertibility. On the other hand, the Ordnance Department, while recognizing {{the usefulness of the}} Christie, was of the opinion that it was mechanically unreliable and that such dual-purpose equipment generally violated <b>good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practice.</b> The controversy over the advantages and drawbacks of Christie tanks raged for more than twenty years, with the convertible principle being abandoned in 1938. But the Christie ideas had great impact upon tank tactics and unit organization in many countries and, finally, upon the US Army as well.|$|E

For bachelor's degree programmes, {{there are seven}} (7) courses offered as well as courses from other centers, such as Engineering Geology, Engineering Survey, Geotechnical Laboratory, Soil Mechanics, Geotechniques, GIS for Engineers, Highway and Traffic Engineering. There are four (4) courses offered as an elective course, namely Foundation Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Urban Traffic Management and Pavement Engineering. These courses are designed to provide <b>good</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>practice</b> to young graduates in the related fields. In addition, two master's degree programmes (by coursework) are offered under this center, which are M.Sc in Geotechiques and M.Sc in Highway Engineering, emphasize given to the specialized courses in the respective field. Besides, postgraduate research programmes (M.Sc and PhD) are also offered in specific areas such as advanced saturated and unsaturated soil mechanics, numerical modeling, soil stabilization, tropical rock engineering, site investigation and geophysics. While for transportation engineering the interest fields include pavement engineering, traffic, road safety engineering and urban transportation. Based on the expertise of the lecturers at the center, three research centers have been established under the Institute for Infrastructures Engineering and Sustainable Management (IIESM) namely myGERMeG, GeoFORENSIC and TRANSIT. Under myGERMeG research center, the members are actively involved in research, consultation and act as expert advisory group addressing geotechnical design and development {{in the areas of}} tropical rock engineering, soil and rock testing, and soft soil stabilization. Meanwhile, members of GeoFORENSIC research center address geotechnical problems related to tropical climate, especially on residual soil and soft marine clays i.e. landslide, soil erosion, ground settlement of highways and construction embankments on marine clay, karstic limestone and sinkholes, collapse of excavation during deep constructions and tunneling. TRANSIT research center focuses on transportation systems, infrastructure and intelligent transport which involve planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities and infrastructure. As one of the center of studies in the Faculty of Civil Engineering UiTM, it is equipped with the best laboratory facilities and latest equipment/software for the purpose of teaching and learning, research, consultancy and staff/student development.|$|E
