50|$|In Rayleigh scatter based {{distributed}} <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>sensing,</b> {{a coherent}} laser pulse is sent along an optic fiber, and scattering sites within the fiber cause the fiber {{to act as}} a distributed interferometer with a gauge length approximately equal to the pulse length. The intensity of the reflected light is measured as a function of time after transmission of the laser pulse. This is known as Coherent Rayleigh Optical Domain Reflectometry (COTDR) When the pulse has had time to travel the full length of the fiber and back, the next laser pulse can be sent along the fiber. Changes in the reflected intensity of successive pulses from the same region of fiber are caused by changes in the optical path length of that section of fiber. This type of system is very sensitive to both strain and temperature variations of the fiber and measurements can be made almost simultaneously at all sections of the fiber.|$|E

In FLRD, optical losses of a light pulse in a fiber loop induced by changes in a quantity are measured by the light decay time constants. FLRD measures time to detect a quantity; thus, FLRD {{is referred to as}} a time-domain sensing technique.
