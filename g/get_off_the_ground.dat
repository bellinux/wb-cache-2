This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized {{as soon as it}} touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, {{the project}} was called into {{question}} when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script {{in an attempt to}} reduce the film's budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, , White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative, as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Percival P.74 (later Hunting Percival P.74) was a British {{experimental}} helicopter {{designed in the}} 1950s {{that was based on}} the use of tip-jet powered rotors.

25|$|No new rail {{projects}} {{were able to}} <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for many years until the 1990s when several factors combined to make the idea more palatable to area politicians. Governor Jesse Ventura and Minnesota Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg heavily promoted the idea of rail transport, and significant amounts of money became available from the federal government. Previous governors had advocated light rail, but {{had not been able}} to get legislation passed. Governor Tim Pawlenty had campaigned on a promise to fight the expansion of light rail, but altered his opinions after taking office. He also initially opposed the Northstar Line commuter rail project, which is a rail corridor north of Minneapolis, but changed his mind about that project in January 2004 when a scaled-back version was shown to have good potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{syndicated}} series ran for 1,320 episodes {{over seven}} seasons. An attempt at an eighth season did not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> as not enough stations {{were willing to}} pick up the series for an additional year. With this in mind, Goodson-Todman offered host Blyden the hosting position on Showoffs, a charades-based game show that the company was developing for ABC's daytime lineup. He accepted and shot a pilot shortly after What's My Line? ended production. However, Blyden never got to host the series as he was killed in an automobile accident while traveling in Morocco just before taping was to begin. At the time of Blyden's death, a handful new episodes of What's My Line? had yet to air in certain markets; by the fall of 1975, the last of these episodes had aired across the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, the Irish Republican Brotherhood or 'Fenians', {{attempted}} an insurrection {{aimed at}} the ending of British rule in Ireland. However, the rebellion was badly organised and failed to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In Dublin, fighting was confined to the suburb of Tallaght. Several thousand Fenians (estimated at between 4–8,000 men) marched out to Tallaght Hill, and some fought a brief skirmish with the police at the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Tallaght. However, due to poor leadership and unclear plans, they dispersed shortly thereafter, several hundred were arrested. The failure of this rebellion did not {{mark the end of}} nationalist violence however. An attempt to free three Fenian prisoners in Manchester killed a guard, for which three Fenians were hanged. Dublin saw mass demonstrations in solidarity with those executed and an Amnesty Campaign for the other Fenian prisoners.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of a}} multi-pronged {{approach}} to a rescue, a Chinook helicopter of No. 27 Squadron RAF was mobilised from Abu Naji to Majar al-Kabir with a quick reaction force onboard. The helicopter lifted off at 11:05am and returned to Abu Naji around 11:30am after coming under sustained fire and having at least seven casualties aboard, who were wounded by the insurgent fire. The helicopters' route into the town meant it having to fly over the rooftops to try and locate Bravo Company who were holed {{up in one of}} the houses. Whilst it flew in low, it made itself a target for small arms fire and RPGs, with no less than six RPGs being fired at the helicopter. As the damage to the helicopter was severe and casualties were mounting, the pilot, Wing Commander Guy Van den Berg, decided that safest option was to return to base. The Sergeant in charge of the QRF asked that the helicopter land away from the immediate danger and allow the non-wounded on board to disembark. Van den Berg replied that if the Chinook landed, it might not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> again.|$|E
