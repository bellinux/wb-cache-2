5|$|The <b>demographic</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the {{population}} of Croatia are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29 million. The population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate; the natural growth rate of {{the population}} is negative. Croatia is in the fourth or fifth stage of the demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age {{of the population is}} 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E

25|$|As in {{the rest}} of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, {{dominated}} by the Democratic Party. Impoverished by the Civil War, the state continued with an economy based on tobacco, cotton and agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the western counties of the Piedmont, based on cotton mills established at the fall line. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the Wright brothers, near Kitty Hawk on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the Great Migration. Their departure changed the <b>demographic</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> many areas.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, <b>demographic</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E

40|$|Background Community {{misconception}} of {{what causes}} cancer {{is an important}} consideration when devising communication strategies around cancer prevention, while those initiating social marketing campaigns must decide whether to target the general population or to tailor messages for different audiences.

2500|$|Furthermore, a basic intuition that Silver {{drew from}} his {{analysis}} of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example. Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and [...] "similar states," [...] Silver estimated a [...] "538 regression" [...] using historical voting information along with <b>demographic</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.|$|E
