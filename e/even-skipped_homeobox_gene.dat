40|$|In {{recent years}} much {{progress}} has been made in the understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in specification of the cells of the endoderm, which give rise to the epithelium of the gut and respiratory system. However, little is known about the way in which the gut becomes patterned along its anteriorâ€“posterior axis, that is, how boundaries are established between the different epithelia of the gut tube. Here we show that the expression patterns of five genes divide the Xenopus tadpole gut epithelium into at least four regions along this axis in the undifferentiated, 3 -day-old gut (stage 41), and that these divisions are maintained until at least 7 days, when cell differentiation is well under way. In addition, the restricted expression patterns of these genes clearly mark the anterior and posterior boundaries of the intestine. Xsox 2 is expressed in the anterior gut, spanning the oesophagus and stomach but terminating at the stomach/intestine boundary. Xcad 1 and Xcad 2, two caudal-type homeobox genes, are expressed in a region with an anterior limit at this boundary and a posterior limit between the colon and proctodeum, therefore covering the whole of the small and large intestines. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) is expressed only in the anterior small intestine, and the <b>even-skipped</b> <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> Xhox 3 is expressed in the most posterior part of the gut, the proctodeum...|$|E

40|$|<b>Homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> encode DNA-binding proteins, many {{of which}} are implicated in the control of {{embryonic}} development. Evolutionarily, most <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> fall into two related clades: the ANTP and the PRD classes. Some genes in ANTP class, notably Hox, ParaHox, and NK genes, have an intriguing arrangement into physical clusters. To investigate the evolutionary history of these gene clusters, we examined <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> chromosomal locations in the cephalochordate amphioxus, Branchiostoma floridae. We deduce that 22 amphioxus ANTP class <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> localize in just three chromosomes. One contains the Hox cluster plus AmphiEn, AmphiMnx, and AmphiDll. The ParaHox cluster resides in another chromosome, whereas a third chromosome contains the NK type <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes,</b> including AmphiMsx and AmphiTlx. By comparative analysis we infer that clustering of ANTP class <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> evolved just once, during a series of extensive cis-duplication events of genes early in animal evolution. A trans-duplication event occurred later to yield the Hox and ParaHox gene clusters on different chromosomes. The results obtained have implications for understanding the origin of <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> clustering, the diversification of the ANTP class of <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes,</b> and the evolution of animal genomes...|$|R

In the present study, we identified <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> belonging to 14 different classes in five legume species, including chickpea, soybean, Medicago, Lotus and pigeonpea. The characteristic differences within homeodomain sequences among various classes of <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> family were quite evident.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are a {{large and}} diverse group of genes, many of which play {{important}} roles in the embryonic development of animals. Increasingly, <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are being compared between genomes {{in an attempt to}} understand the evolution of animal development. Despite their importance, the full diversity of human <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> has not previously been described. Results We have identified all <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> and pseudogenes in the euchromatic regions of the human genome, finding many unannotated, incorrectly annotated, unnamed, misnamed or misclassified genes and pseudogenes. We describe 300 human homeobox loci, which we divide into 235 probable functional genes and 65 probable pseudogenes. These totals include 3 <b>genes</b> with partial <b>homeoboxes</b> and 13 pseudogenes that lack homeoboxes but are clearly derived from <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes.</b> These figures exclude the repetitive DUX 1 to DUX 5 homeobox sequences of which we identified 35 probable pseudogenes, with many more expected in heterochromatic regions.

50|$|This gene {{belongs to}} the <b>homeobox</b> family of <b>genes.</b> The <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> encode a highly conserved family of {{transcription}} factors that {{play an important role}} in morphogenesis in all multicellular organisms. Mammals possess four similar <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> clusters, HOXA, HOXB, HOXC and HOXD, which are located on different chromosomes and consist of 9 to 11 genes arranged in tandem. This gene is one of several <b>homeobox</b> HOXC <b>genes</b> located in a cluster on chromosome 12. The product of this gene may play a role in the development of hair, nail, and filiform papilla.|$|R
30|$|Os 06 g 0646600 is {{classified}} {{in a class}} II KNOTTED-like homeobox (KNOX) subfamily of rice <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> (Jain et al. 2008). The rice <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> family is divided into zinc finger homeodomain (ZF-HD), homeodomain-leucine zipper protein (HD-ZIP), plant homeodomain (PHD) finger domain, Bell 1 -like homeobox (BLH), KNOX, and WUS-like homeobox (WOX) subfamilies (Jain et al. 2008). Glabrous Rice 1, which encodes a WOX, regulates micro-hair formation on rice leaves (Li et al. 2012). KNOX-type <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> {{may be associated with}} the number of micro-hairs on rice leaves, although involvement of KNOX genes in trichome formation has not been reported in Arabidopsis.|$|R
40|$|The <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> {{family of}} Drosophila appears {{to control a}} variety of position-specific {{patterning}} decisions during embryonic and imaginal development. Most of these patterning decisions determine groups of cells on the anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila germ band. We have isolated a novel <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> from Drosophila, designated H 2. 0. H 2. 0 has the most diverged homeobox so far characterized in metazoa, and, in contrast to all previously isolated <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes,</b> H 2. 0 exhibits a tissue-specific pattern of expression. The cells that accumulate transcripts for this novel gene correspond to the visceral musculature and its anlagen...|$|R
40|$|<b>Homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are {{essential}} for both {{the development of the}} blood and lymphatic vascular systems, as well as for their maintenance in the adult. <b>Homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> comprise an important family of transcription factors, which are characterised by a well conserved DNA binding motif; the homeodomain. The specificity of the homeodomain allows the transcription factor to bind to the promoter regions of batteries of target genes and thereby regulates their expression. Target genes identified for homeodomain proteins have been shown to control fundamental cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. We and others have reported that <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in the placental vasculature, but our knowledge of their downstream target genes is limited. This review highlights the importance of studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> and their downstream targets may regulate important vascular cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and endothelial tube formation, which {{are essential}} for placental vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. A better understanding of the molecular targets of <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> may lead to new therapies for aberrant angiogenesis associated with clinically important pregnancy pathologies, including fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia...|$|R
