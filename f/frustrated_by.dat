50|$|The {{situation}} {{had grown to}} be so <b>frustrating</b> <b>by</b> 1878 that the South Australian government offered a reward of £200 to anyone who could develop an effective mechanical stump puller; although myriad devices were developed, none {{proved to be a}} breakthrough success. Many of these machines were trialled in contests near Gawler in the same year, but none were as effective as three skilled axemen.|$|R
5000|$|Inside Social Games {{compared}} {{the depth of}} Outernauts gameplay favourably to other social games, but warned that the social viral mechanics, such as [...] "nag screens" [...] and [...] "pay to win" [...] mechanics would ward off the core gamers it set to attract. [...] GamesTM likewise, found the energy system to be the games biggest hindrance, and one which could <b>frustrate</b> <b>by</b> interrupting gameplay. Despite this, GamesTM concluded that Outernauts was [...] "a step up on most Facebook games".|$|R

5000|$|The Guardian {{initially}} {{scored the}} film {{two out of}} five stars, saying it was [...] "really hard to finish" [...] and [...] "liable to leave you queasy" [...] but a later review by a different reviewer scored the film {{four out of five}} stars describing it as a [...] "light, delightful movie". Eric Kohn of IndieWire wrote, [...] "The movie primarily <b>frustrates</b> <b>by</b> doing nothing fresh. Careening toward an overly neat and tender resolution, [...] "The F Word" [...] lacks the gall to let its uncoordinated characters wind up victims of their situation".|$|R

5000|$|The Flemish {{saw these}} {{facilities}} {{as a measure}} of integration to another language, as opposed to viewing it as a recognition of a permanent linguistic minority. The French-speaking people, however, saw these language facilities as an acquired right, and a step for an eventual addition to the bilingual region of Brussels, even though that would be unconstitutional. As a result, the amount of French-speaking people in these regions (mostly around Brussels) did not decline, and contain a growing majority of French-speaking Belgians, even though they reside in the officially monolingual Flanders. This [...] "frenchification" [...] is considered <b>frustrating</b> <b>by</b> the Flemish Movement and a reason for a call to separate.|$|R

500|$|In 2003, {{a version}} for Java-based mobile phones was {{announced}} by Sony Pictures Mobile. Reviewers generally acknowledged it as a faithful port of the arcade original, but criticized the controls. Modojo's Robert Falcon {{stated that the}} diagonal controls take time to adapt to {{on a cell phone}} with traditional directions. Michael French of Pocket Gamer concluded: [...] "You can't escape the fact it doesn't exactly fit on mobile. The graphics certainly do, and the spruced-up sound effects are timeless… but really, it's a little too perfect a conversion." [...] Airgamer criticized the gameplay as monotonous and the difficulty as <b>frustrating.</b> <b>By</b> contrast, Wireless Gaming Review called it [...] "one of the best of mobile's retro roundup".|$|R

He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his arrest}} and release Chatwin left Benin {{and went to}} Brazil to {{continue}} his research on de Sousa. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>by</b> the lack of documented information on de Sousa, Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him.

5|$|In 1835, still <b>frustrated</b> <b>by</b> {{the lack}} of {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the Railway and Port Company, Hesketh-Fleetwood organised the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company to raise the funds required to bring the railway to Fleetwood. The estimated cost was £122,000. The company obtained Royal assent to start construction, with an underwritten guarantee from Hesketh-Fleetwood.

40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{offer new}} paradigms for training, allowing novel forms {{of teaching and}} learning to be devised; unfortunately, however, many e-learning systems are still based on complex procedures and unusable interfaces, which are regarded as intimidating, confusing or simply <b>frustrating</b> <b>by</b> the user. In this paper we consider the possibility of exploiting vision and speech as intuitive communication channels, to enhance the quality of the interaction between users and e-learning platforms. Through an analysis of current research in the field of vision-based and speech-based perceptive interfaces, we will discuss some application scenarios for e-learning, stressing the important role that such natural communication forms could play in improving the interaction process.
