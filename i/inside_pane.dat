50|$|To {{keep the}} sun's heat {{out of the}} house, a low-emissivity coating should {{be applied to the}} outside pane of glazed windows. If the windows are {{designed}} to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the <b>inside</b> <b>pane</b> of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.|$|E

50|$|The {{image on}} the window is easily seen, {{although}} it is more face-like from some angles than from others. It is said that the image is only visible from outside the courthouse; from <b>inside</b> the <b>pane</b> {{appears to be a}} normal pane of glass.|$|R
5000|$|The Adventuredome {{opened on}} August 23, 1993 {{in the west}} {{parking lot of the}} hotel. It sits on a {{reinforced}} 18" [...] thick deck elevated 18 ft above ground. The dome itself consists of over 350000 sq ft of pink tinted, insulated glass over a teal green space frame (to minimize structural poles <b>inside).</b> Each <b>pane</b> of glass weighs approximately 300 lb.|$|R
25|$|Properties Editor: The Properties Editor tool {{is used to}} edit {{properties}} in a GUI <b>pane</b> <b>inside</b> Visual Studio. It lists all available properties (both read-only and those which can be set) for all objects including classes, forms, web pages and other items.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{block of}} flats on the estate in January 2007, showing several flats that had been 'boarded up' <b>inside</b> the widow <b>panes</b> (sometimes with {{curtains}} left in place) {{in an attempt to}} preserve the appearance of the community for the remaining residents, as the estate was prepared for demolition ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a detail}} of a window arch at Mission San Xavier del Baco, Arizona, ca. 1900. Viewed from <b>inside,</b> the six <b>pane</b> window is inset in a {{decorative}} arch with a sculpted and painted scalloped pattern. Paintings of figures and ornaments are on the wall surrounding the window. Below the window is a ledge; and below that three pictures are partially visible hanging on the wall...|$|R
60|$|The window {{contained}} {{photographs of}} {{more or less}} undressed dancing girls; nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines; closed yellow paper envelopes, very flimsy, and marked two-and-six in heavy black figures; a few numbers of ancient French comic publications hung across a string as if to dry; a dingy blue china bowl, a casket of black wood, bottles of marking ink, and rubber stamps; a few books, with titles hinting at impropriety; a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers, badly printed, with titles like The Torch, The Gong—rousing titles. And the two gas jets <b>inside</b> the <b>panes</b> were always turned low, either for economy’s sake or {{for the sake of}} the customers.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrochromic}} (EC) vacuum glazing (VG) {{is formed}} when a vacuum glazing {{is combined with}} an electrochromic glazing. Three glass panes are required, two of which may have a low-emittance coating separated by a pillar array, the space formed being evacuated and sealed contiguously by a metal edge seal, the third glass pane with an EC layer is sealed to the evacuated glass unit. With the EC glazing installed with the electrochromic component facing the outdoor environment, for an incident solar radiation of 300 W m(- 2), when the EC layer is opaque for winter conditions, the <b>inside</b> glass <b>pane</b> of the unit due to solar radiation absorbed by the low-emittance coatings within the vacuum gap and electrochromic layer is a heat source with heat transferred from the glazing to the interior enviromnent.

40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} Miguel Parra adobe in a {{state of}} disrepair, San Juan Capistrano, ca. 1930. The adobe is shown at center, its front door obscured by a bush in the right foreground. On the roof, a box window annex can be seen rising from the wooden shingles, {{what appears to be a}} lightning rod affixed to its peak. To the left, a window is visible, with its original iron bars (or rejas) with glass <b>panes</b> <b>inside</b> and wooden shutters outside. The spackle of the facade is cracking and shows brick in some spots. Photoprint reads "One mile east of Capistrano, south side of Ortega Highway. In orange grove, front north"...|$|R
50|$|Window frost (also called fern frost or ice flowers) forms when a {{glass pane}} {{is exposed to}} very cold air {{on the outside and}} warmer, {{moderately}} moist air on the <b>inside.</b> If the <b>pane</b> is not a good insulator (for example, if it is a single pane window), water vapour condenses on the glass forming frost patterns. With very low temperatures outside, frost can appear {{on the bottom of the}} window even with double pane energy efficient windows because the air convection between two panes of glass ensures that the bottom part of the glazing unit is colder than the top part. On unheated motor vehicles the frost will usually form on the outside surface of the glass first. The glass surface influences the shape of crystals, so imperfections, scratches, or dust can modify the way ice nucleates. The patterns in window frost form a fractal with a fractal dimension greater than one but less than two. This is a consequence of the nucleation process being constrained to unfold in two dimensions, unlike a snowflake which is shaped by a similar process but forms in three dimensions and has a fractal dimension greater than two.|$|R
60|$|The two men, sole {{occupants}} of the somewhat shabby cottage parlour, lingered over their port, not so much with the air of wine lovers, but rather as human beings and intimates, perfectly content with their surroundings and company. Outside, the wind was howling over the marshes, and occasional bursts of rain came streaming against the window <b>panes.</b> <b>Inside</b> at any rate was comfort, triumphing over varying conditions. The cloth upon the plain deal table was of fine linen, the decanter and glasses were beautifully cut; there were walnuts and, in a far Corner, cigars of a well-known brand and cigarettes from a famous tobacconist. Beyond that little oasis, however, were all the evidences of a hired abode. A hole in the closely drawn curtains was fastened together by a safety pin. The horsehair easy-chairs bore disfiguring antimacassars, the photographs which adorned the walls were grotesque but typical of village ideals, the carpet was threadbare, the closed door secured by a latch {{instead of the usual}} knob. One side of the room was littered with golf clubs, a huge game bag and several boxes of cartridges. Two shotguns lay upon the remains of a sofa. It scarcely needed the costume of Miles Furley, the host, to demonstrate {{the fact that this was}} the temporary abode of a visitor to the Blakeney marshes in search of sport.|$|R
6000|$|Poetry here of a {{very high}} (perhaps the highest) order of verbal melody, exquisitely clean and pure, and almost always perfumed, like the tuberose, to an extreme of sweetness--sometimes not, however, but even then a {{camellia}} of the hot-house, never a common flower--the verse of inside elegance and high-life; and yet preserving amid all its super-delicatesse a smack of outdoors and outdoor folk. The old Norman lordhood quality here, too, crossed with that Saxon fiber from which twain the best current stock of England springs--poetry that revels above all things in traditions of knights and chivalry, and deeds of derring-do. The odor of English social life in its highest range--a melancholy, affectionate, very manly, but dainty breed--pervading the pages like an invisible scent; the idleness, the traditions, the mannerisms, the stately ennui; the yearning of love, like a spinal marrow, inside of all; the costumes brocade and satin; the old houses and furniture--solid oak, no mere veneering--the moldy secrets everywhere; the verdure, the ivy on the walls, the moat, the English landscape outside, the buzzing fly in the sun <b>inside</b> the window <b>pane.</b> Never one democratic page; nay, not a line, not a word; never free and naive poetry, but involved, labored, quite sophisticated--even when the theme is ever so simple or rustic, (a shell, a bit of sedge, the commonest love-passage between a lad and lass,) {{the handling of the}} rhyme all showing the scholar and conventional gentleman; showing the laureate too, the attache of the throne, and most excellent, too; nothing better through the volumes than the dedication [...] "to the Queen" [...] at the beginning, and the other fine dedication, [...] "these to his memory" [...] (Prince Albert's,) preceding [...] "Idylls of the King." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{building}} their webs, {{as in many}} other small points, Lucy and Eliza showed from the first no inconsiderable personal differences. Lucy began hers by spinning a long line from her spinnerets, and letting the wind carry it wherever it would; while Eliza, more architectural in character, preferred to take her lines personally from point to point, and see herself to their proper fastening. In either case, however, the first thing done was to stretch some eight or ten stout threads from place to place {{on the outside of the}} future web, to act as points d'appuy for the remainder of the structure. To these outer threads, which the spiders strengthened so as to bear a considerable strain by doubling and trebling them, other thinner single threads were then carried radially at irregular distances, like the spokes of a wheel, from a point in the centre, where they were all made fast and connected together. As soon as this radiating framework or scaffolding was finished, like the woof on a loom, the industrious craftswoman started at the middle, and began the task of putting in the cross-pieces or weft which were to complete and bind together the circular pattern. These she wove round and round in a continuous spiral, setting out at the centre, and keeping on in ever-widening circlets, till she arrived at last at the exterior or foundation threads. How she fastened these cross-pieces to the ray-lines I could never quite make out, though I often followed the work closely from <b>inside</b> through the <b>pane</b> of glass with a platyscopic lens; for, strange to say, the spiders were not in the least disturbed by being watched at their work, and never took the slightest notice of anything that went on at the other side of the window. My impression is, however, that she gummed them together, letting them harden into one as they dried; for the thread itself is always semi-liquid when first exuded.|$|R
