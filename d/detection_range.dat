40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the trend}} for initial detection times using both passive and active sonar during submarine-on-submarine operations. Specifically, it simulates a nuclear powered submarine (SSN) {{searching for a}} diesel submarine {{in an environment where}} the SSN has a speed advantage and active sonar <b>detection</b> <b>ranges</b> exceed passive sonar <b>detection</b> <b>ranges.</b> The simulation uses a mover-sensor discrete event application of SIMKIT, developed by Professor Buss, Arnold The simulation results show that initial detection times of a search follow an exponential trend as a function of SSN speed, diesel submarine speed, <b>detection</b> <b>ranges,</b> ping interval and detection probability. As a result, as <b>detection</b> <b>ranges</b> continue to decrease due to increases in sound quieting technology, initial detection times during a submarine search will increase exponentially. This can render a passive sonar prosecution ineffective when combating a modern diesel submarine. Should SSN use active sonar, initial detection times can be significantly reduced, especially if combined with an effective search path. The threat to the SSN of using active sonar can be mitigated by judicious consideration of ping interval and search speed with detection probability and active <b>detection</b> <b>ranges.</b> All values used to arrive at the conclusions stated are notional, and no classified information sources were consulted as part of this work.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{goal of this}} research was to investigate the performance of low frequency passive sonars in the Arafura Sea. Sound speed profiles representative of the wet and dry monsoon seasons and geoacoustic data were inputted into a finite element primitive equation transmission loss model to model the expected propagation at three frequencies, 10, 50 and 300 Hz. Initial <b>detection</b> <b>ranges</b> for several source/receiver depth combinations and geoacoustic areas (deep/ shallow water) were compared and evaluated. Results demonstrate that low frequency (- 10 Hz) <b>detection</b> <b>ranges</b> suffer due to cutoff frequency problems and to surface-decoupling loss. Propagation in deep water has the added disadvantage of excessive loss of signal power due to spherical spreading considerations. Conversely, higher frequencies (300 Hz) provided extended <b>detection</b> <b>ranges</b> in shallow water due to trapping of energy within the entire 50 m to 100 m water column. Additionally, investigation into advantages to be gained through advanced signal processing techniques shows that improvements of the order of 10 to 15 dB of detection gain are possible through the utilization of inverse beamforming.

5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air <b>detection</b> <b>range</b> and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E

During MAPTIP, TNO Physics and Electronics Laboratory the Netherlands employed a Safire infrared FLIR system aboard a P- 3 Orion aircraft and used the ship, the Hr. Ms. Tydeman, as a target. Ten sorties were flown and meteorological conditions were continuously recorded aboard the Hr. Ms. Tydeman. Additional weather observations were made at an oceanographic platform and at NAS Valkenburg. The weather information was compiled and converted to terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) code for input to the EOTDA. The Safire FLIR was installed as a user-defined sensor into the EOTDA using the minimum resolvable temperature (MRT) curves of the manufacturer. The EOTDA was then run using the standard frigate model included in the EOTDA target menu.

25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical <b>detection</b> <b>range</b> {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used to blank out the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the radio energy. This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to ionise, presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly de-ionise, allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{environmental}} impact on radio wave propagation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and coastal radar systems in the operational area of the Netherlands Coastguard, i. e., the exclusive economical zone (EEZ) of the Netherlands. In {{this part of the}} North Sea, the coastguard monitors marine traffic to maintain a safe and secure environment. For their situation awareness, they are depending on (Class A) AIS and (X-band) radar. However, the operators of these sensor systems often experience abnormal effects such as coverage gaps and different <b>detection</b> <b>ranges</b> for AIS and radar. An important and strongly fluctuating cause of these effects is {{the environmental impact}} on radio wave propagation. Therefore, the weather conditions on the North Sea and the impact of these different conditions are analysed and modelled. In general, five common propagation conditions are known: standard atmosphere, evaporation ducts, standard surface ducts, surface-based ducts, and elevated ducts. The effects of these conditions and their occurrences on the North Sea were studied for AIS and radar. It was found that elevated and surface ducts - most prominent during spring and summer - extend both AIS and radar <b>detection</b> <b>ranges,</b> whereas evaporation ducts - strongest at the end of summer - were found to only extend radar <b>detection</b> <b>ranges.</b> Standard atmospheric conditions lead, for both systems, to minimum <b>detection</b> <b>ranges.</b> The modelling in this thesis is a proof of concept for the coastguard to make a forecast of the coverage of their systems on a daily basis, by using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data. Such a daily forecast will support the coastguard in the deployment of mobile detection units, such as ships and aircraft. The modelling also enables operators to understand why targets appear either on AIS or radar, thus preventing that signals are wrongly considered false or suspicious...|$|R

500|$|With {{only small}} numbers of targets, the full MAR was not needed and Bell {{initially}} proposed TACMAR to fill this need. This would have a shorter <b>detection</b> <b>range,</b> so a long range radar like PAR would be needed for early detection. The missile sites would consist of a single TACMAR along with about 20 Zeus EX missiles. [...] In October 1965 the TACMAR {{was replaced by the}} upgraded MSR from the SCD studies. Since this radar had an even shorter range than TACMAR, it could not be expected to generate tracking information in time for a Zeus EX launch. PAR would thus have to be upgraded to have higher accuracy and the processing power to generate tracks that would be handed off to the MSRs. During this same time, Bell had noted problems with long wavelength radars in the presence of radar blackout. Both of these issues argued for a change from VHF to UHF frequencies for the PAR.|$|E
