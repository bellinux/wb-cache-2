This disturb is caused by electron injection from the outermost wordline into the CT layer of the select devices under the erase condition. The increasing select threshold voltage leads to a reduced string current and, finally, to read fails of the NAND string.

40|$|Abstract: In an {{experimental}} study, significantly higher conductivity values {{than those of}} freshly prepared chemically analogous solutions were found in aged (~one year old) aqueous solutions, except for those stored frozen. The results surprisingly resemble a previously noticed phenomenon in liquid water, which develops when water is stored in closed vessels. This was observed as a <b>disturbing</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in gravimetric measurements and in luminescence spectroscopy measurements. The phenomenon was termed “autothixotropy of water ” due to the weak gel-like behavior which develops spontaneously over time, in which ions seem {{to play an important}} role. Here, according to experimental results we propose that contact with hydrophilic surfaces also plays an important role. The role of the “autothixotropy of water ” in proton transfer is also discussed...|$|E

It also endeavors to identify some greenhouse gas emission reduction and control measures. Index Terms- Emissions, energy consumption, greenhouse gas, power generatio...|$|E

40|$|Since the new millennium, {{approximately}} thirty Italian documentaries {{have focused}} on the Roma, Sinti and other more tendentially nomadic groups. Drawing on writings by theorists including Spivak and Parati, this article contends that many documentaries have successfully articulated counter-hegemonic representations of the Roma, elucidated the counter-histories of second and third generation Italian Roma, and denounced the dual subalternity of Roma women, a condition caused by their own patriarchal communities and by the social marginalization of the Roma within Italian society. However, because of limited resources and access, directors have been unable to depict <b>disturbing</b> <b>phenomena</b> affecting the Roma such as forced adoptions and their exposure to health hazards. While cinema’s effectiveness as an informational tool within society’s changing public sphere is increasingly limited, the article outlines ways in which an emancipatory impetus can be developed – via film projects – to reverse the subaltern position of Italian and European Roma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We re-examine vacuity in {{temporal}} logic model checking. We note two <b>disturbing</b> <b>phenomena</b> in recent results in this area. The first indicates {{that not all}} vacuities detected in practical applications are considered a problem by the system verifier. The second shows that vacuity detection for certain logics can be very complex and time consuming. This brings vacuity detection into an undesirable situation where the user of the model checking tool may find herself waiting {{a long time for}} results that are of no interest for her. In this paper we define Temporal Antecedent Failure, an extension of antecedent failure to {{temporal logic}}, which refines the notion of vacuity. According to our experience, this type of vacuity always indicates a problem in the model, environment or formula. On top, detection of this vacuity is extremely easy to achieve. We base our definition and algorithm on regular expressions, that have become the major temporal logic specification in practical applications...|$|R

The <b>disturbing</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{has led to}} several theories on the emergence of this worrisome trend {{and what could be}} done to stave it off. This paper reviewed the major theoretical perspectives on the campus cult-violence and its attendant psychopathological behaviour among Nigerian youths. The review is selective and confined to the theoretical and investigative perspectives which presumably best fit Nigerian models of socio-cultural background. In the light of the existing empirical research which bears upon these theoretical conclusions; a conceptual framework – psycho-infrastructuralism was proposed as an intervention model. The framework shows the linkages between campus cult-violence and key factors of psycho-personality bias, frustration-aggression hypothesis, ethno-political theory and the environmentalist perspectives. It is suggested that, as a complex dynamic process, campus cult-violence activities and its key covariates must be measured and analyzed within psycho-infrastructural model...|$|E
