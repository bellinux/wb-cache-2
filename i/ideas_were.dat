5|$|As {{the first}} new high school built in several years, many unorthodox <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> suggested. After many of the <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> criticized the school {{district}} requested parental input on {{the direction of the}} school's curriculum and held meetings around the city to show their plans for the curriculum. School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs. The school was planned as and is now a citywide magnet school with no attendance boundary. An emphasis on technology was integrated into the plans for the school.|$|E

In this step a joint list of <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> organised by applying the NGT procedure. <b>Ideas</b> <b>are</b> structured and grouped, some <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> subsumed, redundant <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> deleted, overlapping and interrelated <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> merged, and reorganised <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> levelled into a hierarchy.

40|$|GE is {{pioneering}} {{the development}} of market‐based methods for allocating research budget to internal projects. To be effective, a market for ideas must provide appropriate incentives {{for the creation of}} valuable ideas and it must result in sufficiently accurate evaluation of ideas. The main tenet behind GE’s <b>Idea</b> Market <b>is</b> that improvements in the evaluation of research ideas should foster incentives for idea creation. Indeed, idea creation and <b>idea</b> evaluation <b>are</b> complementary activities. For an <b>idea</b> to <b>be</b> successful, it is not enough that the <b>idea</b> <b>be</b> good. It also helps if the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> recognized as good by those who evaluate it. As the evaluation process becomes more accurate, good <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be funded. Thus, incentives for the creation of <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> enhanced when <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> evaluated more accurately. Consider first the incentives for the creation of new ideas. A key obstacle to the creation of <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> the limited “appropriability ” of their benefits (see Arrow, 1962). The problem <b>is</b> that good <b>ideas</b> can <b>be</b> easily stolen. As a result, inventors might have little if any incentives to come up with good <b>ideas.</b> There <b>are</b> non‐market solutions to this market failure. For example, (open) science gives up on attempts to appropriate privately the benefits of ideas by making the ideas publicly available through the publication process. Creators of scientific <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> rewarded instead by the public recognition awarded through th...|$|R
5|$|As the Ottoman Empire did {{not force}} Muslim {{conversion}} on its conquered western territories, reformed <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> quickly {{adopted in the}} two-thirds of Hungary they occupied (the Habsburg-ruled third part of Hungary remained Catholic). A Reformed Constitutional Synod was held in 1567 in Debrecen, the main hub of Hungarian Calvinism, where the Second Helvetic Confession was adopted as the official confession of Hungarian Calvinists.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko (18 December 1946– 12 September 1977) was a South African anti-apartheid activist. Ideologically an African {{nationalist}} and African socialist, {{he was at}} {{the forefront}} of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the Black Consciousness Movement during the late 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|In {{addition}} to criticism, his <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> often oversimplified, misrepresented, distorted or exaggerated for various purposes. This heightened the controversy. In 1962, the WHO published Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects to which Mary Ainsworth, Bowlby's close colleague, contributed with his approval, {{to present the}} recent research and developments and to address misapprehensions.|$|E

60|$|As a clear <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that whereof {{the mind}} {{has such a}} full and evident perception, as it does receive from an outward object {{operating}} duly on a well-disposed organ, so a DISTINCT <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that wherein the mind perceives a difference from all other; and a CONFUSED <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> such an one as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another, from which {{it ought to be}} different.|$|R
40|$|What {{makes an}} idea {{culturally}} successful, {{such as the}} widespread notion in many societies of ancestor-spirits, a haiku, or the recipe for apple pie? To be sure, not all <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> culturally successful. Some <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> never represented in minds. Some are represented, but never communicated to others. Yet other <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> successfully communicated to enough people that they become fashionable for a short time, but quickly fade away. But {{a small number of}} <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> culturally successful: they permanently invade a group of minds. According to an epidemiological approach to explaining culture, then, “contagious ” ideas and their material effects, such as texts, tools, buildings, artwork, constitute what we call culture.

5|$|Maupertuis' <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> in {{opposition}} to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray. In the late 17th century, Ray had given the first formal definition of a biological species, which he described as being characterized by essential unchanging features, and stated the seed of one species could never give rise to another. The ideas of Ray and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology and the argument from design.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1832, {{abolitionist}} {{and journalist}} William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women.

5|$|The {{study of}} phase {{transition}} {{and the critical}} behavior of observables, termed critical phenomena, was a major field {{of interest in the}} 1960s. Leo Kadanoff, Benjamin Widom and Michael Fisher developed the ideas of critical exponents and widom scaling. These <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> unified by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1972, under the formalism of the renormalization group in the context of quantum field theory.|$|E
5|$|These <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> {{informed}} by events {{prior to the}} Great Depression when – {{in the opinion of}} Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.|$|E
5|$|These <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} {{taken as}} postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.|$|E
50|$|Modification of NGT, {{undertaken}} by Bartunek and Murnighan, helps {{to deal with}} ill-structured problems. Normal <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> generated and listed, followed by the facilitator questioning if the <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> relevant to the same problem. If not, the problem {{is said to be}} ill-structured, and the <b>ideas</b> generated <b>are</b> clustered into coherent groups. These clusters of ill-structured <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> then treated as problems in their own right, and the NGT procedure is applied to them. Regular breaks are taken by the participants to ensure that the group feels they are still working on the original problem.|$|R

50|$|Self-refuting {{ideas or}} self-defeating <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> <b>ideas</b> or {{statements}} whose falsehood {{is a logical}} consequence of the act or situation of holding them to <b>be</b> true. Many <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> called self-refuting by their detractors, and such accusations are therefore almost always controversial, with defenders stating that the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> being misunderstood or that the argument is invalid. For these reasons, none of the <b>ideas</b> below <b>are</b> unambiguously or incontrovertibly self-refuting. These <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> often used as axioms, which are definitions taken to be true (tautological assumptions), and cannot be used to test themselves, for doing so would lead to only two consequences: consistency (circular reasoning) or exception (self-contradiction). It {{is important to know}} that the conclusion of an argument that is self-refuting is not necessarily false, since it could be supported by another, more valid, argument.|$|R

Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Final Fantasy III in 1990, Square {{planned to}} develop two Final Fantasy games—one for the Nintendo Entertainment System {{and the other}} for the forthcoming Super NES, to be known as Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V respectively. Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the NES game and continued development of the SNES version, retitled Final Fantasy IV. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the NES version was approximately 80% complete and certain <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> reused for the SNES version.|$|E

In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
