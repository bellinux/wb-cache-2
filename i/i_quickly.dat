25|$|As the Safavid-Ottoman war drew to its close, Abbas I renewed {{efforts to}} bring Georgia more {{completely}} into his empire. His relations with Teimuraz <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> deteriorated after the king of Kakheti turned down the shah's summons to Esfahan. Teimuraz, threatened with an Iranian invasion, attempted to buy peace by sending his two sons, Alexander and Leon, and his mother Ketevan as honorary hostages to the shah's court in 1613. This move, however, failed to relieve pressures on Kakheti.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{decided at}} a young age she wanted to be an actress: [...] "I grew up {{immersed}} in film. My family were in the business. <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends' parents." [...] She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau. She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P.D.James' Devices and Desires. Also that year, she appeared as a young woman engaging in a forbidden affair with a Nazi officer in the Hallmark film One Against the Wind. In 1992 she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in Rachel’s Dream, a 30‑minute Channel4 short, and in 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs.|$|E

500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{made his}} first visit to the {{archives}} of the Comintern in Moscow in September 1992. Later he made three more visits, the last in December 1994. In 2009, at a conference, Stéphane Courtois said: [...] "I did not go to promote The Black Book of Communism in Russia.... In any case, I do not go back again for quite some time.... <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> became aware that I was under constant surveillance in the archives".|$|E

Wagner no longer held events in Biebrich but moved to Vienna in November 1862. There he again tried to premiere [...] "Tristan," [...] but without success. Although Wagner had a lot of money from a concert tour in Russia in 1863, he was again in financial straits. Finally, he had to flee from Vienna to avoid being put in [...] debtors' prison.|$|E

50|$|In early 1992 Harrison had “a two page {{idea that}} <b>I</b> wrote <b>quickly.</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{want to get}} caught up in the {{development}} process.

2500|$|On 24 February 1943, {{the second}} {{prototype}} HM599 first flew, representing the [...] "Tempest Mk I" [...] {{equipped with the}} Napier Sabre IV engine; this flight had been principally delayed by protracted problems and slippages encountered {{in the development of}} the new Sabre IV engine. HM599 was at first equipped with the older Typhoon cockpit structure and vertical tailplane. The elimination of the [...] "chin" [...] radiator did much to improve overall performance, leading to the Tempest Mk <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> becoming the fastest aircraft that Hawker had built at that time, having attained a speed of 466mph (750km/h) during test flights.|$|E
2500|$|Many footballers {{described}} beating Victoria {{as one of}} the top {{achievements in}} South Australian football. Neil Kerley ranked beating Victoria above his club premierships. Victorian footballers have commented on the passion and hatred directed towards them in interstate games played in Adelaide. Garry Lyon described the fans as [...] "hostile and maniacal", and [...] "by the time the games came around they were whipped into a frenzy". Paul Roos commented about the first state game he played in South Australia that [...] "when walking up the entrance and onto Football Park was an experience in itself. [...] <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> realised how much hatred existed towards Victorians and their football." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his election, John Paul <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> {{made several}} {{decisions}} that would [...] "humanise" [...] {{the office of}} pope, admitting publicly he had turned scarlet when Paul VI placed his stole on Luciani's shoulders while the pontiff visited Venice on 16 September 1972. He was the first modern pope to speak in the singular form, using 'I' instead of the royal we, though the official records of his speeches were often rewritten in more formal style by aides, who reinstated the royal we in press releases and in L'Osservatore Romano. He initially refused to use the sedia gestatoria until others convinced him of its {{need in order to}} allow himself to be seen by crowds. He was the last pope to use it. He was the first pope to refuse to be crowned. Instead of a coronation, he inaugurated his papacy with a [...] "papal inauguration" [...] where he received the papal pallium as the symbol of his position as Bishop of Rome.|$|E

2500|$|While Evans {{considered}} himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album From Left to Right on, he also released some material with Fender-Rhodes piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (e.g. Herbie Hancock) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up {{returning to the}} acoustic sound. [...] "I don't {{think too much about}} the electronic thing, except that it's kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice. (...) [...] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers a certain kind of sound that's appropriate sometimes. I find that it's a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but I don't need it (...) I don't enjoy {{spending a lot of time}} with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> tire of it, and I want to get back to the acoustic piano." [...] He commented that electronic music: [...] "just doesn't attract me. I'm of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege." ...|$|E
2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> realised I didn't want to carry on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{liberal in}} its content, the Constitution created a {{centralized}} government, where the provinces had no true autonomy. Desire for local control sparked a minor rebellion in some provinces {{in the northeast}} in 1824 which was easily suppressed, but the incident was enough to reveal discontent with the State's organization. At the end of 1825, a secessionist rebellion began in Cisplatina, the southernmost Brazilian province. Unlike {{the rest of the}} nation, its population consisted of both Luso-American and Hispano-American elements, a result of colonial times when sovereignty over the region shifted between Portugal and Spain. The United Provinces of South America (a former Spanish colony later known as Argentina) formally annexed the Brazilian province. The Empire responded with a declaration of war, which [...] "was to draw Brazil into a long, inglorious, and ultimately futile war in the south" [...] – the Cisplatine War. João VI died in March 1826, {{a few months after the}} outbreak, and Pedro I inherited the Portuguese crown, becoming King Pedro IV. Brazil and Portugal were again reunited—though only in a personal union—barely 2 years following the end of the war for Brazilian independence. Pedro <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his eldest daughter Maria II, but as she was a minor, he retained involvement in Portuguese affairs.|$|E
