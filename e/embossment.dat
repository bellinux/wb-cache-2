40|$|Composite slabs {{consist of}} {{trapezoidal}} steel sheeting and concrete cover. The steel sheeting serves as both, a lost framework and a tension bearing member after hardening of concrete. The longitudinal shear between the sheeting and the concrete must be ensured by a mechanical interlock, for example shear studs or prepressed <b>embossments</b> in the sheeting. The traditional massive shear studs {{have to be}} welded to the supporting construction of the slab. Alternatively, thin screws can be drilled through the sheeting and cast into the concrete to ensure the composite action or to strengthen the composite slab in reconstructions locally.

The current study was based on finite element analysis using ANSYS 8. In the experimental programme, carried out by author, ten simply supported composite deck slabs were tested to failure under two point line load at L/ 4 (Shear span) of the span. These tested specimens were analysed by the finite element method and the analysis have shown these slabs displayed a high degree of flexural characteristics, ultimate strength and ductility. Close agreement had been observed between the finite element and the experimental results for ultimate loads and load deflection responses. The finite element model was thus found to be capable of predicting the behaviour of composite deck slab accurately...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThin-walled {{cold formed}} {{corrugated}} steel sheet with <b>embossments,</b> used in composite steel concrete slab, is a modern and effective construction. The steel sheet {{is used as a}} permanent formwork and as a load bearing member after hardening of concrete as well. The prestressed <b>embossments</b> are crucial to ensure a composite action. However, its load bearing capacity is influenced by many factors and {{it is not possible to}} be determined without using expensive and time consuming tests of the whole slab in laboratory. This paper is focused on composite action using this type of shear connection and its behaviour under different types of loading. Four-point bending tests and vacuum tests were performed on the whole span slab. Additional small-scale shear test help us to understand the shear behaviour of thin-walled steel sheet in ultimate limit state. The data from the tests make possible to set up and calibrate numerical models. These models can then facilitate pointing out the main factors which influence the load bearing capacity of this type of structure...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{improvement}} of composite slabs characterization throughout the use of advanced finite elements models. The accurate three-dimensional modelling of a full scale commercial steel sheet and concrete slab geometries enables {{the analysis of the}} composite slab micromechanics. The inclusion of the <b>embossments</b> depth and slope, the steel sheet thickness, the tilting angle, the length and width and spacing of <b>embossments,</b> and the profiling angle of the rib shape removes the need of simplifications for the complex phenomenon at the steel – concrete interface. The accuracy observed at the finite element models once compared with the laboratory specimens enables a new approach to describe the complex stress distributions in composite slabs. In particular, this study introduces a novel representation of the longitudinal shear strength Tau(u) and a newly defined vertical normal stress Sigma(u) between the steel and concrete that frequently define the overall composite slab bearing capacity. Subsequently, this study compares detailed stress diagrams and deformations from the finite elements models with experimental data obtained through piezoelectric gauges at the laboratory specimens.

50|$|Embossing is {{the process}} of {{creating}} raised relief within one's design. Embossing is used to create both concave and convex shapes by alternating the side on which the embossing is performed. Using the embossing tools and appropriate embossing pad, the parchment is rubbed backwards and forwards or side to side in parallel movements with increasing downward pressure so that the parchment can be evenly stretched. A finished <b>embossment</b> will be satin-white in color and will contrast with the translucency of the parchment paper. Color can be varied by moderating the level to which the shape is embossed.

When tracing the mapping pen should be allowed to glide easily over the parchment, no pressure should be used as this increases the amount of ink that is dispersed from the nib and may also create an unintentional <b>embossment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Currently, most cold-formed {{steel sheet}} designs for {{composite}} slabs incorporate a repeating pattern of <b>embossments</b> {{along the entire}} length of the steel sheet ribs. Their function is to hinder the longitudinal slipping, similarly to the corrugation of the rods in reinforced concrete, so that the longitudinal shear forces are transferred between steel and concrete. However, in composite slabs, the wedge effect of the <b>embossments</b> transforms the relative slipping of the steel sheet and concrete into forces acting on the interface, causing the transversal bending of the sheet, the separation and relative slipping between steel and concrete and, eventually, the complete detachment and the resistance drop. This paper is presenting the experimental results of a new bonding system, under patent by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), ensuring the full connection between steel sheet and concrete, applied to composite slabs. The system consists in producing a series of many small crown-shaped breakages on the steel sheet, which are oriented towards the side of the sheet that will remain in contact with the concrete. When fresh concrete is poured, the projections of the mentioned breakages are embedded therein; once the concrete is set, their function is to resist the shearing forces and separating forces generated between both materials when the composite steel-concrete element is loaded.
