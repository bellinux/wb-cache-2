500|$|During her {{audition}} for the show, Thorne read the {{lines from the}} Pembleton character in a previous episode. She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't {{want to say that}} but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very {{aware of the fact that}} it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so {{that one of your}} creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E
500|$|Once again, Patton {{found other}} {{commands}} given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel {{and in one}} incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took Trier, Coblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented {{virtually all of the}} remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to by-pass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: [...] "Have taken Trier with two divisions. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give it back?" ...|$|E

500|$|The demo {{was sent}} to {{producer}} Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add {{to the fact that}} they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and this is just another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say? Everybody thinks he has the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references safe-sex. The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The next time you want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well anybody can do it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The song features clattering programs and icy synth block-chords.|$|E
2500|$|Reznor was {{considering}} Adrian Belew (who played in several bands, including King Crimson and the live band for David Bowie) exhibited to Le Pig, so Flood made a welcoming {{phone call and}} invited him to the house surrounding the studio (10050 Cielo Drive). Upon entering Le Pig he asked, [...] "Hi, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do?". The production team communicated back to Belew, who spoke about what tuning the song was played at. Reznor responded, [...] "Um, I'm not sure. Probably E. See what happens. Don't worry about it. Here's the tape, [...] do whatever you want. Go!". Belew eventually recorded what became the odd ending of the song.|$|E
2500|$|Despite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men {{arrested for}} the crime have vehemently denied {{involvement}} in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators {{tried to get him}} to testify falsely against Zach Adams. The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that [...] "hey kept him up all night, would not give him anything to eat or drink and finally he said, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say? According to family members, Dylan has some ability to read, but cannot perform other tasks such as telling time, and they believe that Dylan is being manipulated.|$|E

In a followup at the OPEC summit, Reuters wrote that [...] "Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can", and that Chávez said to a throng of reporters at the OPEC summit, [...] "For a while now, I have needed {{to go to the bathroom}} and I am going to pee ... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pee on you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know what {{you expect me to}} <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go down there with a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment. On January26, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him [...] "crazy" [...] during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - {{to point out that the}} condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E
