40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the attitudes of}} Black and White students in academically gifted programs to determine if attitudes of Black students toward giftedness and toward their peers in programs <b>for</b> the <b>gifted</b> are {{a factor in the}} under-representation of Black students in gifted programs. Sixty-five students in ninth grade in a Richmond, Virginia, school <b>for</b> the <b>gifted,</b> who had attended a regular public school program <b>for</b> the <b>gifted</b> the year before, were surveyed, with usable responses from 15 Black students and 33 White students. Survey results indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} in attitudes of Black and White gifted students toward giftedness and toward people in programs <b>for</b> the <b>gifted.</b> All Black students and 97 % of White students were pleased to be identified as academically gifted. The majority of all students enjoyed programs <b>for</b> the <b>gifted</b> and felt that they were worthwhile. All the Black students and 85 % of White students felt they learned a lot from their classes <b>for</b> the <b>gifted.</b> While a small percentage of Black students indicated more negative attitudes by peers, this was offset by more White students who felt left out of activities by their friends and who were teased about being in the gifted program. The paper concludes with suggestions for including more Black students in programs <b>for</b> the academically <b>gifted.</b> An appendix contains comments by gifted Black students and bar graphs depicting responses by Black and White students on each questionnaire item.

5|$|Improvements {{in public}} schools were the {{hallmark}} of Carroll's term. Using money from a coal severance tax enacted by Ford's administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes. He strengthened the Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks. A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings. Vocational and special education were expanded, and a program <b>for</b> <b>gifted</b> and talented students was piloted. Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from 46th to 38th nationally in teacher salaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks.

On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities <b>for</b> <b>gifted</b> children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E

5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools <b>for</b> <b>gifted</b> students or those wishing {{to study a}} specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk {{to prepare students for}} a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, {{and by the time he}} left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 general {{election}} brought a Conservative government {{to power and}} allowed the Council to shift its focus towards retaining Grammar Schools where they still existed and improving schools where work had been put on hold during the comprehensive debate; despite 90% of English councils adopting comprehensive education, Lincolnshire had retained its grammar schools. Although the County Council began discussing the abolition of them again in 1985, opposition from parents at a public consultation in 1987 resulted in the plans being dropped. With the question of its future resolved, Carre's applied for grant-maintained status in 1989; the Education Secretary approved the proposals and formally granted the status in September 1990. When grant-maintained status was abolished in 1999, Carre's became a Foundation School. Following a successful bid to the DfES, submitted in October 2002, the school was granted specialist Sports College status in 2003. An all-weather pitch was laid out in 2007, and a new technology building with a fitness suite opened in 2011. In 2009, Carre's became a specialist Science College and a lead school <b>for</b> <b>gifted</b> and talented students. The school converted to Academy status in August 2011. In 2014, the governors announced their intention to bid for conversion to a multi-Academy trust and become a coeducational, selective school on a new site; in February 2015, Kesteven and Sleaford High School announced its intention to join the proposed trust, a moved welcomed by Carre's. Carre's officially {{became part of the}} Robert Carre Multi-Academy Trust on 1 September 2015; the schools continue to operate on their sites, sharing staff and facilities.|$|E
