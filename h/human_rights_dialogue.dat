40|$|This report {{presents}} five {{case studies}} on EU <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Dialogues</b> (HRDs). The case studies concern the HRDs with the African Union, China, India, Morocco and Peru. Building {{on the findings}} of the previous reports in Work Package 3 of the FRAME project, the aim of this report is to explore how domestic and organisation-based conceptions of <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> democracy and rule of law emerge in HRDs and what consequences these conceptions entails for the HRDs’ goals. The report starts with a description of the methodology used (Chapter II). Next, Chapter III puts HRDs in context by examining their institutional setting. The Chapter specifically focuses on three key issues: respect for sovereignty and the equality of participants; transparency; and the priorities of the dialogues. Chapter IV is dedicated to the case studies. The Chapter is divided in two parts: the first part focuses on General <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Dialogues</b> and the second on Formal <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Dialogues.</b> General HRD’s are Dialogues of a general nature based on regional or bilateral treaties, agreements or conventions or strategic partnerships dealing systematically with the issue of <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> The first case study in this category concerns India. This is an elaborate study. It fills a gap in the scholarly literature since the EUIndia HRD has so far been little researched. One of the main difficulties that the case study highlights with the HRD is that the EU is conditioned by an essentially Eurocentric world-view about India. The next case study in this first part of the Chapter concerns Peru. The research shows that although the EU’s conceptions of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> differ in some respects from the Peruvian, the Dialogue has been productive. The last case study in the part of General HRD’s concerns European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), more specifically Morocco. This too is an elaborate case study which presents a much-needed addition to the academic literature. It details the institutional setting of the dialogue and describes to what extent diverging conceptions of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> appear in the dialogue, and what the sensitive issues are in this respect. Despite the conceptual differences, this is probably the most successful dialogue of the ones analysed in this report. The second part of the Chapter, the part on Formal HRDs, starts with a brief case study on the African Union. In this dialogue there are real points of contention between the two partners, such as the views on the International Criminal Court and concerning the issue of migration. The case study raises the asymmetry of the bilateral relation rooted in the colonial past. It closes with a brief case study on the HRD with China. It highlights that the EU and China conceptualise <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> democracy and rule of law differently. These differences are emphasised often by the Chinese. Guarding its national sovereignty, China is cautious about the suggestions made by other powers. In Chapter V the reports concludes with discussing how the institutional settings of the Dialogues impacts their content. It then reflects on key overarching topics, namely state sovereignty; the critique of double standards; universality and cultural diversity; indivisibility; when conceptions patter; and the politicisation of conceptual differences. It closes with some suggestions on how the HRD’s could be strengthened...|$|R

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of the legislation and practice of freedom of information in Norway and Vietnam.

The thesis aims to spell out an understanding and rationale {{of the right to}} information and aims to provide constructive suggestions on how to enhance the implementation of such right in the process of law making in Vietnam, and how to learn from the processes of law making and law implementation. In addition, the thesis aspires to be of use to the continued <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>dialogues</b> and cooperation between Vietnam and Norway. The conclusion is that although there are differences in politic, culture and level of development, the right to information is a universal moral right which must be made into law. In both contexts, such a law should address the emerging societal needs of the country and be implemented under conditions of the institutional reform towards more openness and transparency...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} devoted to the mapping of legal and policy {{instruments}} of the EU for <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy support. In particular, it highlights the EU´s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> priorities in terms of themes and vulnerable groups in its external action based on a review of EU policy documents and literature. In order to do so the report first identifies the instruments that set up the frame of the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy policy. The framework of the EU’s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy policy is presided by the Strategic Framework on <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> and Democracy, which establishes the principles, objectives and priorities that must guide the EU’s action. Two general objectives, each with a different scope, can be identified in the Strategic Framework: the EU’s and its Member States’ commitment to promote the universality of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and the EU’s determination to promote <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy in its external action. In addition, the Strategic Framework highlights some areas of action which identify specific objectives and priority themes and groups. Although the Strategic Framework is on <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy, the emphasis throughout the document is on <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> not on democracy. Democracy is ‘an aspiration’ that it is not defined. There are other relevant documents that set out the EU´s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy policy. As well as general policy papers on mainstreaming <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and promoting <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy in the EU external action, there are specific <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> guidelines on priority themes and vulnerable groups and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> strategies towards particular third countries. In order to implement its <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy policy, the EU has developed a broad range of instruments. Some of them have been especially created in order to contribute to the specific objective of the promotion of <b>human</b> <b>right</b> and democracy worldwide; in particular, the EIDHR, the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> clauses, the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> focal points in EU Delegations, the EUSR for <b>Human</b> <b>Rights,</b> election support and the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>dialogues</b> and consultations. Moreover, the EU uses other traditional instruments of its CFSP to promote <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy in its relations with third countries. These instruments respond to the EU’s objective of mainstreaming <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy in all its policies and actions toward third countries. Among them, those that should be highlighted are the EU’s action in multilateral fora, bilateral political dialogues, démarches and declarations,, CFSP decisions, restrictive measures and, finally, thematic and geographic financial programmes. Regular assessment of the implementation of the EU’s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy policy is one of the outcomes stated in the Action Plan. This evaluation of policy is mainly carried out through one specific instrument: the EU’s Annual Report on <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> and Democracy in the world. In addition, {{as a consequence of the}} EU’s approach to put <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> at the core of its external action, <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy promotion constitute also an important part of other EU’s Annual Reports relating to other external policies, such as CFSP and Development...|$|R
