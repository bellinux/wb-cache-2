40|$|The author explores a {{fundamental}} trade-off that occurs between settlement delay and <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> {{in the daily}} operation of large-value payment systems (LVPS), with specific application to Canada's Large Value Transfer System (LVTS). To reduce settlement delay, participants generally must maintain greater <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> in the system. <b>Intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> and settlement delay can be costly for LVPS participants, and improvements in the trade-off are desirable. The replacement of standard queuing arrangements with a complex queue-release algorithm represents one such improvement. These algorithms are expected to lower <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> needs and speed up payments processing in an LVPS. Simulation analysis is used to empirically test this proposition for the case of Canada's LVTS. The analysis is conducted using a payment system simulator developed by the Bank of Finland, called the BoF-PSS 2. The author shows that increased use of the LVTS central queue (which contains a complex queue-release algorithm) reduces settlement delay associated with each level of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> considered, relative to a standard queuing arrangement. Some important issues emerge from these results. Payment, clearing, and settlement systems...|$|E
40|$|Alongside {{consolidation}} and globalisation of {{the financial}} markets, the increase in values exchanged in payment and settlement systems has been remarkable. The size of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> requested to expedite settlement of such values is accordingly very significant, especially compared to overnight or longer term liquidity. The increasing use of risk control arrangements in payment and settlement systems (e. g. real-time gross settlement) is typically associated with higher liquidity needs, which have been balanced by the parallel development of several forms of liquidity saving features in systems. The most remarkable developments have affected the qualitative management of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity.</b> A clear trend illustrated by continuous linked settlement (CLS) is the shortening of the time horizon in <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> management. On the “supply” side, <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> can be provided by central banks or commercial banks, depending on the settlement asset used by systems. Since most central banks extend credit only against collateral, the type of assets that participants can use {{is an important factor}} in determining the opportunity costs of intra-day liquidity. In the past decade, most central banks have substantially broadened the range of collateral they accept in their provision of liquidity. Furthermore, an interbank <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> market seems to start emerging in relation with concentration of correspondent banking activities and funding costs related to critical time windows. Developments affecting <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> management need to be adequately considered from a financial stability perspective. Liquidity risk profile has changed alongside a variety of factors including consolidation which has led to a concentration of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk and the development of interdependencies in payment and settlement systems. One lesson to be drawn from the recent period is the usefulness for central banks, to have a list of eligible assets that is diversified enough to address an unexpected increase in collateral demand, in order to mitigate the consequences of a financial turmoil. Over the past decade, the relevant actors, including the banking sector, central banks and the banking supervisors have taken various initiatives to better approach the diverse challenges raised by developments in <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Central bank policy responses encompass the provision of new settlement services which allow to optimize <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> management of banks (e. g. the new TARGET 2 platform), the adaptation of their collateral policy to the new landscape of interdependent payment systems and oversight initiatives to better monitor and address changing risks. ...|$|E

40|$|Large value {{payment and}} {{securities}} settlement systems are important components of an economy's financial system. Many such systems are operated by central banks and are liquidity intensive. Central banks often provide inexpensive liquidity to facilitate settlement. This {{leads to a}} number of policy questions about the provision of such liquidity. To answer these questions, central banks need to understand what factors influence the timing of settlement. This paper offers a model to better understand intraday patterns of settlement and identifies three factors that influence the timing of settlement: the cost of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity,</b> a participant's exposure to settlement risk, and system design. Incorporating all three factors enables our model to explain a number of stylized facts concerning behavior within the Federal Reserve's Fedwire fund and securities systems around a major policy change. In particular, the model captures the different responses of the two systems in both the pattern of settlement and the use of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity.</b> The results map out how policy interacts with participants' incentives to influence the use of <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> and the resultant credit exposure of a central bank.

We show that the relationship between jumps and market liquidity depends on the respective dimensions of liquidity. First, the increase in ex-ante and ex-post trading costs is statistically significant but the economic impact remains limited. Second, jumps are driven by a sharp rise in the demand for immediacy, rather than by weak liquidity supply. As such, jumps {{do not seem to be}} due to an endogenous deficient provision of market liquidity. Third, there is rather strong evidence of resilience, whatever the liquidity measures under consideration. We also find that liquidity shocks in the effective spread and the number of trades contribute the most to the likelihood of jumps. Finally, examining post-jump price discovery process, we conclude that liquidity is more informative immediately after jumps compared to the case where there is no jump...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Algorithmic trading {{attempts}} to reduce trading costs by selecting optimal trade execution and scheduling algorithms. Whilst many common approaches only consider the bid-ask spread when measuring market impact, the authors aim to analyse the detailed limit order book data, {{which has more}} informational content. Design/methodology/approach – Using data from the London Stock Exchange's electronic SETS platform, the authors transform limit order book compositions into volume-weighted average price curves and accordingly estimate market impact. The regression coefficients of these curves are estimated, and their intraday patterns are revealed using a nonparametric kernel regression model. Findings – The authors find that market impact is nonlinear, time-varying, and asymmetric. Inferences drawn from marginal probabilities regarding Granger-causality do not show a significant impact of slope coefficients {{on the opposite side}} of the limit order book, thus implying that each side of the market is simultaneously rather than sequentially influenced by prevailing market conditions.

40|$|Preliminary Draft, Please do not Quote) The US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank {{have adopted}} a number of measures, {{including}} aggressive policy rate cuts, to ease the liquidity crunch {{in the financial markets}} following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Using high frequency spot and forward foreign exchange quote and interest rate data in the period from 1 September to 31 December 2008, this study investigates how these policy actions affect the dynamics of market liquidity condition. Following Hui et al. (2009), the paper uses the differential between the US dollar rate implied by the covered interest parity condition and the corresponding US dollar interest rate as a proxy for (the lack of) the liquidity in the US dollar money market. The study focuses on EUR/USD and compares the most stressful crisis period with other relatively less stressful periods. The paper then examines how policy action announcements by the central banks affect the dynamics of <b>intraday</b> money market <b>liquidity.</b> The study employs autoregressive models to capture the potential effects of monetary policy action announcements on both the mean and volatility of the liquidity proxy. The results show that the coordinated cuts of policy rates failed to stimulate lending in the short-term US money market, whereas the unlimited currency swap line offered by the Federal Reserve with other central banks succeeded in reducing the illiquidity and the effectiveness persisted longer for short-term funding.

This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, most central banks, {{concerned}} about settlement risks inherent in payment netting systems, have implemented real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. Although RTGS systems can significantly reduce settlement risk, they require greater liquidity to smooth nonsynchronized payment flows. Thus, central banks typically provide intraday credit to member banks, either as collateralized credit or priced credit. Because intraday credit is costly for banks, how <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> is managed has become a competitive parameter in commercial banking and a policy concern of central banks. This article uses a game-theoretical framework to analyze the <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> management behavior of banks in an RTGS setting. The games played by banks depend on the intraday credit policy of the central bank and encompass two well-known paradigms in game theory: "the prisoner's dilemma" and "the stag hunt. " The former strategy arises in a collateralized credit regime, where banks {{have an incentive to}} delay payments if intraday credit is expensive, an outcome that is socially inefficient. The latter strategy occurs in a priced credit regime, where postponement of payments can be socially efficient under certain circumstances. The author also discusses how several extensions of the framework affect the results, such as settlement risk, incomplete information, heterogeneity, and repeated play.

40|$|<b>Intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk is {{a subject}} that applies to all banks, and arises {{whenever}} there is a timing mismatch between incoming and outgoing payments within a business day. In case such a mismatch occurs, the bank is exposed to the risk that it is unable to meet its payment obligations at the time expected. A liquidity buffer could help to mitigate this risk. This thesis presents a framework for <b>intraday</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk management within ABN AMRO Bank, while taking different priorities of transactions into account. We examine the use of extreme value theory (EVT) and propose two metrics to capture the risk: the univariate and multivariate risk metric. The univariate risk metric represents {{the size of the}} liquidity buffer for each priority group separately and provides granular view. Making use of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in combination with univariate EVT, we are able to estimate the size of the liquidity buffer for a specified time interval within a business day. We forecast the buffer size 30 days out-of-sample and test the violations against the conditional coverage (CC) hypothesis. Satisfactory results are obtained for the groups with high and moderate priority when the highest confidence levels are considered: α = 0. 1 and 0. 05. For the group with low priority, the risk metric performs well for the lowest confidence levels: α = 0. 025 and 0. 01. The multivariate risk metrics aggregates the size of the liquidity buffer, while taking the diversification of the priority groups into account.
