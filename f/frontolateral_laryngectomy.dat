During the frontolateral approach, the lesion and its limits were carefully defined, the surgical margins were established under the rigid telescope and the patients’ margins were studied under contact endoscopy after methylene blue staining. Frozen section examination of the margins was performed and the histopathological analysis was compared to the surgical and endocopic findings. The infraglottic region and the surgical margins were free of disease in all cases and there was a 100 % correlation with the histopathological examination. All patients are alive with no evidence of disease after a minimum of 5 years’ follow-up.

40|$|CONTEXT: Swallowing is a {{continuous}} dynamic process, characterized by complex stages, that involves {{structures of the}} oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. It {{can be divided into}} three phases: oral, pharyngeal and esophageal. Dysphagia is characterized by difficulty with, or the inability to swallow food of normal consistencies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of swallowing difficulties and modifications made to the consistency of the food consumed in cases of total and partial laryngectomy, with or without subsequent radiotherapy, among patients who had not been diagnosed as having dysphagia. TYPE OF STUDY: Descriptive study. SETTING: Voice Clinic of São Paulo Hospital, Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina, São Paulo, Brazil. METHOD: 36 laryngectomy patients: 25 total and 11 frontolateral cases, were studied. A survey consisting of a 23 -item questionnaire was applied by a single professional. RESULTS: Among those interviewed, 44 % reported having modified the consistency of the food consumed (56 % of the total and 20 % of the partial <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> cases). It was not possible to investigate the influence of radiotherapy on the groups in this study, because the partial <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> cases were not exposed to radiotherapy. There was a higher incidence of complaints of swallowing difficulties in total laryngectomy cases (p < 0. 027) than in partial frontolateral cases. However, there was no relationship between the surgery and weight loss. We also noted the patients' other problems regarding the eating process, as well as the compensation that they made for such problems. DISCUSSION: Research has shown an association between laryngectomy and swallowing difficulties, although there have been no reports of associated changes in eating habits among laryngectomized patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that difficulty in swallowing is not rare in total and <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> cases. Such patients, even those who did not complain of dysphagia, also had minor difficulties while eating, and had to make some adaptations to their meals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. Early {{laryngeal}} {{cancer is}} treated with surgery or radiotherapy. A partial laryngectomy {{instead of a}} to-tal laryngectomy {{can be used for}} treating patients with radia-tion failures. Methods. Patients were grouped by the two types of par-tial laryngectomies we performed: group I, endoscopic laser surgery (n = 42); and group II, <b>frontolateral</b> partial <b>laryngectomy</b> (n = 21). Results. With CO 2 laser treatment, 14 of 24 patients (no involvement of the anterior commissure) and eight of 18 patients (involvement of the anterior commissure) were cured. With the <b>frontolateral</b> partial <b>laryngectomy,</b> we achieved local control in 15 of 21 patients. Conclusions. If the surgeon is familiar with the different techniques of, and indications for, partial laryngectomy, this can be a good and satisfying treatment in selected patients with radiation failure for glottic cancer.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} a modified flap technique (MFT) involving {{the use of}} a false vocal fold flap for glottic reconstruction and the removal of arytenoid cartilage and to compare it with conventional <b>frontolateral</b> partial <b>laryngectomy</b> (FLPL) and laser cordectomy (LC). Methods: Twenty-eight MFT, 13 FLPL and 12 LC patients completed a standardised questionnaire for assessing aspiration, respiration, quality of life, and subjective voice quality. We analysed vocal function in terms of roughness, breathiness and hoarseness, measured voice range profiles, and performed videoendoscopy. Results: No patient reported respiratory problems. Aspiration occurred in 33. 3 % (MFT), 41. 6 % (FLPL) and 16. 6 % (LC). Voice quality was rated as good/satisfactory by 17 MFT patients (62 %), satisfactory/sufficient by 69 % of FLKT patients, and sufficient/poor by 75 % of LC patients. Conclusions: The modified false vocal fold flap effectively covers defects and creates a neocord that ensures good phonatory rehabilitation and has positive effects on postoperative quality of life...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade the primary {{treatment}} of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer was shifted towards organ preservation, i. e. preservation of the larynx. The treatment of laryngeal cancer was changed from standard radiotherapy towards hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Hypopharyngeal cancer is nowadays mostly treated {{with a combination of}} chemotherapy and radiotherapy instead of primary surgery. Therefore, the greatest shift in treatment protocols found was for hypopharyngeal cancer. The goal of this thesis was in the first place to find out whether recurrent laryngeal cancer can be treated with preservation of the larynx and the consequences of organ preservation for the function of the “new” organ. The second goal of this thesis was to find out which treatment protocols are used in the Netherlands for hypopharyngeal cancer. Also, to find the consequences of chemoradiation protocols for surgical treatment of recurrent hypopharyngeal cancer. Chapter I is a general introduction of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. The incidences of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer are mentioned. Furthermore, the biggest risk factors, being smoking and alcohol, are described. Especially, the effect of tobacco smoke on the development of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer is described. Tobacco smoke contains several substances, which can cause mutations in genes. The mutations deregulate several enzyme systems and cell regulation systems, which cause degeneration of squamous cell epithelium. An overview of the other chapters of this thesis is given. In Chapter II two partial laryngectomy techniques are described. The oncological and functional results of the endoscopic CO 2 laser and the <b>frontolateral</b> partial <b>laryngectomy</b> for the treatment of the recurrent glottic laryngeal cancer are described. The indications of both techniques are mentioned. Both techniques have good oncological results and less functional problems were found. With the CO 2 laser 44 - 58 % of the patients are cured with preservation of the larynx; with the <b>frontolateral</b> partial <b>laryngectomy</b> 71 % was cured. It is important to realize that in case of a new recurrence, a total laryngectomy can be performed without an extra risk of failure for therapy. Both partial laryngectomy techniques, CO 2 laser and <b>frontolateral</b> partial <b>laryngectomy,</b> are good treatment modalities for recurrent glottic laryngeal cancer. However, the indications for the different techniques are important and should be followed strictly. In chapter III the functional and oncological results of the third partial laryngectomy technique, cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (CHEP), is described. With the CHEP 79 % of the patients are cured with preservation of the larynx. In eight patients a Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) was performed to objectify problems swallowing. In none of the patients aspiration was found. Before and after the operation the voice was recorded and judged. After the operation the voice is worst. However, most patients are satisfied with there voice. The CHEP appears oncologically safe and functional for the treatment of recurrent glottic laryngeal cancer in selected patients. In chapter IV was investigated whether the quality of life is different after a partial laryngectomy versus a total laryngectomy for recurrent laryngeal carcinomas after radiotherapy. Also the voice of both groups of patients was judged. The quality of life was investigated with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) – C 30 Dutch version 3. 0 and the EORTC – H & N 35 questionnaire. The only difference found was smell and taste related. The voice was judged with the Voice Handicap Index. No {{differences between the two groups}} were found. There are no big differences in quality of life after treatment with a partial or a total laryngectomy. This is mainly caused by the unexpected good quality of life after a total laryngectomy. In chapter V the treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer in the Netherlands is described. The treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer in the period 1985 – 1994 was investigated. The biggest group of patients was treated with radiotherapy alone or with combined radiotherapy and surgery. The overall 5 -year disease-free survival after treatment with curative intention was 32 %. The disease-free survival is better after combined surgery and radiotherapy. In chapter VI, the complications after salvage surgery in patients prior treated with radiotherapy alone or chemoradiation is described. The post-operative complication rate is significantly higher (92 % vs. 50 %) in the chemoradiation group. The most frequent complication found was a pharygocutaneous fistula. The quality of life, after a longer post-operative period, showed a significant difference in social functioning in disadvantage of the chemoradiation group. In the general discussion (chapter VII) the found results are discussed. The most important conclusion is that there is place for organ preservation therapy, but we must remain critical of indications and side effects of organ preservation protocols while we should realize that quality of life after total laryngectomy are not as poor as we might sometimes think...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study was conducted}} to analyse videokymographic findings from patients who underwent vertical <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> with reconstruction using a sternohyoid muscle flap. Overall, 22 patients with T 1 b and T 2 glottic tumours and more than one year of follow-up were studied. Two experienced observers analysed the recorded videokymographic data. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. The images showed the vocal vibratory behaviour during sustained /i/ phonation. The vibratory source was supraglottic in 7 / 22 patients, glottic in 11 and mixed in 4. The mean duration of the glottic cycles extracted from the supraglottic, mixed and glottic vibratory sources was 6. 4 ms, 5 ms and 4. 6 ms, corresponding to the fundamental frequency (f 0) of 188. 7 Hz, 200 Hz and 215. 7 Hz, respectively. Of the 11 patients with a glottic vibratory source, 4 did not present a closed phase in the glottic cycle. The mean open quotient was 79 %, 40 % and 63 %, for the supraglottic, mixed and glottic vibratory sources, respectively. All 11 reconstructed vocal cords presented a rounded lateral peak. Of the 15 preserved vocal cords, 11 presented a rounded lateral peak and 4 had sharp peaks. All patients with a glottic vibratory source presented a rounded medial peak. All the vocal cords evaluated presented a mucosal wave, which was normal in 3 patients with a glottic source and clearly reduced in the others. Only one case presented phase asymmetry. The mean values for the amplitude asymmetry index were 0. 92 and 0. 68, for the mixed and supraglottic vibratory sources, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. After {{external}} partial laryngectomias, videostroborscopy is very usefull in {{evaluation of}} postoperative phonatory mehanisms showing the “slow motion” of the vibrations {{of the remaining}} laryngeal structures. The aim {{of this paper was}} to compare the videostroboscopic characteristics of the vibration and to establish the differences in the phonation mechanisms {{depending on the type of}} external partial laryngectomy performed. Methods. This prospective study was conducted during the period 2003 - 2009 at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, including 99 patients with laryngeal carcinoma, treated with open surgical approach using different types of vertical and horizontal partial laryngectomy. Videostroboscopy was used to analyse vibrations of the remaining laryngeal structures. Results. The dominant vibration structure after partial horizontal laryngectomy, chordectomy, <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> and three quarter laryngectomy was the remaining vocal fold, after hemilaryngectomy it was the false vocal fold and after subtotal and near total laryngectomy it was the arythenoid. In patients with supracricoid hemilaryngopharyngectomy performed, many different structures were involved in the vibration. After most of the partial laryngectomies, vibrations can be found in the reconstructed part of the defect. In both horizontal and vertical partial laryngectomies movements of the larynx during phonation were mostly medial, while in cricohyoidoglottopexies they were anterior-posterior. Most of the operated patients (72. 7 %) had insufficient occlusion of the neoglottis during the phonation. Conclusion. Videostroboscopy is a useful method in examining the phonation mechanisms of reconstructed laryngeal structures after partial laryngectomy as well as in planning postoperative voice therapy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} swal- lowing using a reproducible objective methodology and to seek preoperative factors that could influence swallowing outcomes in patients operated on for partial laryngectomy. Twenty-four patients who underwent partial <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> with epiglottic reconstruction for T 1 bN 0 or T 2 N 0 glottic carcinoma between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Using fiberoptic endoscopic and videofluoroscopic evaluation, early (15 days postopera- tively) and late (2 months postoperatively) scores were obtained for all patients to quantify their swallowing skills. Eighty-three percent of patients achieved at least partial oral feeding at time of hospital discharge and 87. 5 % achieved exclusive oral feeding within 2 months postop- eratively. Early score was good or excellent in 50 %, average in 4. 2 % and poor in 41. 8 %. Regarding late scores, 63 % were classified as having a good or excellent late score, 7 patients (29 %) were classified as ''middle result'' because their time to recover was longer (i. e. between 1 and 2 months postoperatively), and two patients had a poor late score. Finally, at last follow-up, only one patient was partially fed by gastrostomy (180 days after surgery). T stage (p= 0. 04) was the only factor influenc- ing early swallowing outcomes and length of hospital stay was longer for poor scores than for good late results (p= 0. 02). Our findings show good outcomes in terms of postoperative swallowing. Objective assessment of deglu- tition is essential for a better understanding of the mecha- nisms of postoperative swallowing disorders and for patient selection...|$|E

To evaluate vocal parameters after modified fron-tolateral partial <b>laryngectomy</b> (MFLPL) and <b>frontolateral</b> par-tial <b>laryngectomy</b> (FLPL) in both excised canine and finite element models. Study Design. FLPL and MFLPL were compared, using a pro-spective paired case control laboratory study with excised canine larynx and computational modeling. Setting. Basic science study conducted in university laboratory. Methods. FLPL and MFLPL were performed serially on 9 excised canine larynges. The excised larynx bench appara-tus {{was used to}} collect phonation threshold pressure (PTP) and high-speed video data. A finite element model was built to compare a normal vocal fold with applied ten-sion, a cut fold with no applied tension (simulating FLPL), and a cut fold with applied tension (simulating MFLPL). Stress values and distributions across the 3 conditions were computed. Results. The mean PTP increase after MFLPL (15. 45 - 17. 46 cmH 2 O) was not statistically significant. In the excised canine model, fundamental frequency (F 0) showed a significant increase for the MFLPL (P =. 039). Differences in vibration amplitudes were not statistically significant. Von Mises stress distribution was most similar between the MFLPL model and the normal fold. Maximum von Mises stresses at the midline were 17. 56, 21. 63, and 5. 10 kPa for the normal, MFLPL, and FLPL, respec-tively, and 47. 57, 63. 98, and 101. 97 kPa at the peripheries. Conclusions. From these results, we conclude that MFLPL {{has the potential to}} give a better voice outcome while avoiding tracheotomy in partial laryngectomy patients. In vivo study in canines to examine the healing process would lend fur-ther evidence-based support for this surgical method...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{therapeutic}} effect of middle frontal {{horizontal partial laryngectomy}} (MFHPL) in treating stage T 1 b squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx involving anterior vocal commissure (AVC) was {{compared with that of}} the anterior <b>frontolateral</b> vertical partial <b>laryngectomy</b> (AFVPL). The feasibility and practical significance of MFHPL in clinical application was discussed in the present study. Methods: From January 1996 to January 2010, a total of 65 patients diagnosed with stage T 1 bN 0 M 0 glottic laryngeal cancer were treated with MFHPL or AFVPL. The postoperative complications, glottic reconstruction, recurrence rate, voice quality and survival rates were evaluated and compared between two treatments. Results: AFVPL and MFHPL were performed in 34 and 31 patients, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed that in the MFHPL-treated patients the reconstructed glottis was spacious and symmetric. In contrast, AFVPL treatment resulted in irregular glottic area with poor symmetry and tubular glottis. The incidence of postoperative laryngeal stenosis significantly differed between the MFHPL- and AFVPL-treated groups (P = 0. 025). No significant difference was detected in the 3 - and 5 -year overall- or tumor-free survival rates between two treatments. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and maximum phonation time (MPT) after surgery were 51. 0612. 99 and 12. 4263. 44 sec in the AFVPL-treated group; while in the MFHPL-treated patients they were 31. 8167. 48 and 7. 6561. 98 sec, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our first}} attempts {{to develop a}} method for the objective assessment of quality in substitution voices. The objective analysis deals with acoustic parameters characterising short voice and speech samples like a sequence of isolated vowels, a sequence of VCV and CVCVCV syllables, a short sentence, etc. A database of 113 registrations from 68 patients (53 total laryngectomy patients with tracheo-esophageal speech, 14 total laryngectomy patients with esophagcal speech and 5 patients with partial <b>frontolateral</b> <b>laryngectomy)</b> and 6 registrations from healthy control persons was collected. Each registration consisted of seven speech utterances and was subjected to an acoustic analysis {{as well as to}} a perceptual evaluation, the latter involving eight parameters like "overall impression", "tonicity", etc. Since the goal of our work is to find out the best acoustical measurement for supporting perception and making it precise, it seemed logical to strive for a perceptually based acoustic analysis. We therefore performed the analysis by means of a peripheral auditory model with a built-in fundamental frequency (pitch) extractor. From the frame-level outputs (a frame is 10 ms) of the analyser, global objective parameters, such as (1) the percentage of voiced frames, (2) the average voicing evidence, (3) the voicing length distribution and (4) the fundamental frequency jitter, were computed for the different speech utterances. So as to reduce the parameter variability arising from the nature of the speech utterances (e. g., the presence of pauses in the signal, errors caused by the pitch extractor, etc.), the objective parameters were computed using non-standard averaging schemes involving energy weighting and frame selection. A statistical analysis of the objective parameters confirms that the quality of tracheo-esophageal speech is superior to that of esophageal speech, but inferior to that of normal speech and speech with the preservation of one vocal fold. Correlations between the objective parameters and the perceptual parameters are moderate. status: publishe...|$|E

We calculated the mathematical proportion between the midsagital dimension of the synechia of the anterior commissure and the {{measurement of the}} free border of the intermembranous region of each vocal fold the preserved one and that reconstructed with the bipedicle sternohyoid muscle flap. the acoustic evaluation showed an important increase in the fundamental frequency, and the values of all parameters were changed regardless of the anterior commissure synechia findings.
