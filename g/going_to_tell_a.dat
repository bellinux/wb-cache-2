5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs {{him that if he}} proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2016, in the Rolling Stone video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she {{discusses}} how {{the music}} industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. [...] "You’ve got {{to give me a}} really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E
2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture {{and one of our}} local people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. I suppose it was one really small thing that you just do and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The entertainment," [...] he said, [...] "will incur {{no greater}} {{hardship}} upon you {{than a little}} patience. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Primrose and Periwinkle, do {{you hear}} what he says?" [...] cried Cowslip, dancing with delight. [...] "Cousin Eustace is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us <b>a</b> dozen better stories than that about the Gorgon's Head!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were about}} to honour me," [...] he said, [...] "by taking me into your confidence." [...] Mr. Vimpany stared in tipsy bewilderment. Mountjoy tried again in plainer language: [...] "You were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>a</b> secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, signor, and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> {{lie about}} it, {{whatever}} the consequences may be. Still, I wish I {{could get out}} of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had been}} drinking. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie about it. But he needn't have done as he did. Faddle knows that, and can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|John {{was called}} up at once, and the Next Neighbor accosted him gayly: [...] "If you {{had known that}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story you would have walked faster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Nugent is all right," [...] said Mary Phillips, [...] "but I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> {{word about}} her or {{anything}} else until you've had some breakfast. I know you have not tasted food this day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I cannot {{tell you}} the truth," [...] he promised, [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> lie, but apart from that I admit nothing. I do not even admit that it was I whom you saw." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> plain tale; one not {{pleasant}} for me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> or {{for you to}} hear, but we've got {{to stand}} it. I know all about that fellow; and I know he is no earl's son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really {{spoke of}} marriage, I bain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story {{and say he}} didn't to please you. I have already tried to please you too much for my own good!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In coorse," [...] {{explained}} Gabriel; [...] "ye disremember, Olly, that Gracey never hez let on to me, her own brother, whar she ez, and she wouldn't be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> stranger. Thar's them personals as {{she never}} answered!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story, one {{of those}} tales of {{astonishing}} adventures that happened {{years and years and}} years ago. Perhaps you wonder why it is that so many stories are told of [...] "once on a time", and so few of these days in which we live; but that is easily explained.|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{thought he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>a</b> secret; so {{he said that he}} wouldn't on any account, and that Mr Fips might entirely depend upon him. But as Mr Fips said 'Very good,' in reply, and nothing more, Tom {{prompted}} him: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I-- er-- I had {{the last}} line, but Tubbs knocked it out of me," [...] grumbled Songbird. [...] "And say, he knocked {{something}} else out of me!" [...] he exclaimed suddenly. [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>an</b> important bit of news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by talking about a story? I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> story; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a {{statement}}. A statement is a matter of fact, therefore the exact opposite of a story, which is a matter of fiction. What I am now <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you really happened to me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shifted from}} one foot to another, and looked as if he wished himself out of my way. At a later time of my life, I have {{observed}} that these are signs by which an honest man is apt to confess that he has told, or is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>a</b> lie. As it was, I only noticed that he answered confusedly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to play to-day," [...] she said, [...] "and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> single story. Aunt Janet won't let me put pebbles in my shoes, but I've put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if I lean back the least bit. And I'm going to work buttonholes all over this cotton. I hate working buttonholes worse than {{anything}} in the world, so I'm going to work them all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|I warn my [...] "kyind friends," [...] then, that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> {{story of}} {{harrowing}} villainy and complicated--but, as I trust, intensely interesting--crime. My rascals are no milk-and-water rascals, I promise you. When {{we come to}} the proper places we won't spare fine language--No, no! But when we are going over the quiet country we must perforce be calm. A tempest in a slop-basin is absurd. We will reserve that sort of thing for the mighty ocean and the lonely midnight. The present Chapter is very mild. Others--But we will not anticipate THOSE.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{secured the}} {{acquittal}} of Oliver Hilditch," [...] she persisted. [...] "He is {{by this time}} a free man. Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak to you of that responsibility. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> little {{about the man who}} owes his freedom to your eloquence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Tom <b>a</b> {{word about}} it, but keep {{it for a}} {{surprise}} till he comes. He will be here next week, and then we 'll have a grand clearing up of mysteries," [...] said Fan, evidently feeling that the millennium was at hand.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor breathed freely. [...] "Listen, Capataz," [...] he said, {{stretching}} out his arm almost affectionately towards Nostromo's shoulder. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> very simple thing. You are safe {{because you are}} needed. I would not give you away for any conceivable reason, because I want you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't get {{a chance}} to listen. As I was coming up I saw the first man give the second man some money. Then the second man looked up and saw me, and shoving the money into his pocket, he dove across the street and into the crowd. That made me feel sure it was Crabtree, and I ran after him pell-mell. I {{followed}} him for about half a block. But the crowd was too much for me, and he got away. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> policeman, but then I thought he couldn't do any more than I could, and I made up my mind I'd wait for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This isn’t so {{very much}} of a story,” went on Shadow, as all looked at him. “Dave telling Buster not to let outsiders know put me in mind of it. Once {{the mother of a}} little girl told her that her uncle had been naughty and had been put in prison for it. Said the mother, ‘Now, Lucy, don’t tell anybody.’ So Lucy went out to play and pretty soon, when she had all her companions around her she said, ‘What do you think my ma said? She said that when anybody has an uncle in prison, like my uncle is, you mustn’t tell anybody. So I’m not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> single person!’” ...|$|E
60|$|Now, I {{was going}} to make a speech--I {{supposed}} I was, but I am not. It is late, late; and so I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story; and there is this advantage about a story, anyway, that whatever moral or valuable thing you put into a speech, why, it gets diffused among those involuted sentences and possibly your audience goes away without finding out what that valuable thing was that you were trying to confer upon it; but, dear me, you put the same jewel into a story and it becomes the keystone of that story, and you are bound to get it--it flashes, it flames, it is the jewel in the toad's head--you don't overlook that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} not," [...] laughed Jenny. [...] "He eats {{a lot of}} other kinds of worms, and he just dearly loves fruit like {{strawberries}} and cherries and all sorts of small berries. Well, I can't stop here talking any longer. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> secret, Peter, if you'll promise not to tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} {{just talking to}} them about--" [...] Thady began; but {{he felt that he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his friend <b>a</b> falsehood, and again held his tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I give out!" [...] laughed Davis, and his {{laughter}} rang cracked like a false piece. [...] "If you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> and there's <b>an</b> end to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was your}} honesty," [...] she continued. [...] "You {{remember}} that night upon the roof at Blenheim House? You were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie for me, and I {{know how you}} hated it. You love the truth, you are truthful naturally; I would rely upon you wherever I was. I know that you would keep your word, I know {{that you would be}} honest. A woman loves to feel that about a man--she loves it--and I don't want you to be brought near the people who sneer at honesty and all good things. I don't want you to hear their point of view. You may be simple and commonplace in some respects; I want you to stay just as you are. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> fact, which I doubt much my {{readers will}} {{hesitate}} to believe; {{but if they}} do, they are welcome not to believe a word in this whole history--for nothing which it contains is more true. It must be known then that the nose of Antony the Trumpeter was of a very lusty size, strutting boldly from his countenance like a mountain of Golconda, being sumptuously bedecked with rubies and other precious stones, the true regalia of a king of good fellows, which jolly Bacchus grants to all who bouse it heartily at the flagon. Now thus it happened, that bright and early in the morning, the good Antony, having washed his burly visage, was leaning over the quarter-railing of the galley, contemplating it in the glassy wave below. Just at this moment the illustrious sun, breaking in all his splendor from behind a high bluff of the Highlands, did dart {{one of his most}} potent beams full upon the refulgent nose of the sounder of brass; the reflection of which shot straightway down, hissing hot, into the water, and killed a mighty sturgeon that was sporting beside the vessel! This huge monster being with infinite labor hoisted on board, furnished a luxurious repast to all the crew, being accounted of excellent flavor, excepting about the wound, where it smacked a little of brimstone; and this, on my veracity, {{was the first time that}} ever sturgeon was eaten in those parts by Christian people.[49] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll do that," [...] he answered. [...] "But {{you must}} keep {{a good part}} of what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> secret--at least for the present," [...] he added, and then gave the {{particulars}} of the joke which had been played on the disliked teacher. Then he told of what had occurred at the gymnasium.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Quatermain," [...] {{went on the}} former, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> story, and {{ask your}} advice, and perhaps your assistance. The agent who {{forwarded}} me your letter told me that I might rely on it implicitly, as you were," [...] he said, [...] "well known and universally respected in Natal, and especially noted for your discretion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Pennycuik, as I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. <b>A</b> {{little after}} {{you were born}} in your English workhouse, your kind, honourable, brave country, England, sent an English gentleman, who could not <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie, <b>to</b> say that so long as the sun rose and the rivers ran in their courses the Transvaal would belong to England. Did you ever hear that, khaki--eh?" ...|$|R
