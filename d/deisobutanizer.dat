25|$|The {{isobutane}} feed to an alkylation unit can {{be either}} low or high purity. Low purity makeup isobutane feedstock (typically < 70% vol isobutane) usually originates from the refinery (mainly from the reformer) {{and need to be}} processed in the <b>deisobutanizer</b> (DIB). High purity feedstock (> 95% vol isobutane) normally originates from an external De-isobutanizer (DIB) tower and is fed directly to the alkylation unit reaction zone. Such isobutane feed does not normally contain any significant level of contaminants.|$|E
40|$|A digital {{simulation}} {{package for}} dynamic simulation of continuous distillation {{units in the}} frequency domain is presented. The package {{is based on a}} rigorous dynamic model that can account for all dynamic phenomena known to be important for control studies. Two industrial scale problems ar presented to demonstrate the software: a fictitious but representative 64 -tray <b>deisobutanizer,</b> and an actual 91 -tray ethane-ethylene splitter. Simulation results reveal the power of the package in computing a wide variety of frequency responses with sufficient accuracy. Â© IEE...|$|E
