40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{differences}} in the management techniques used by Israeli female and male pediatric <b>dentists.</b> All 112 participants of the meeting of the Israeli Society of Dentistry for Children that was held in February 1999 received a questionnaire which sought information regarding age, sex, behavioral and pharmacological methods used to treat children, having a course in nitrous oxide, general anesthesia, and feelings towards pediatric patients. No differences between female and male <b>dentists</b> were found regarding most management techniques. The majority of <b>dentists</b> used tell-show-do, and gave presents at the end of the appointments. Hypnosis was the least used technique. Papoose board was more prevalent among male <b>dentists</b> than among female <b>dentists.</b> Most <b>dentists</b> reported having the parents present during treatment, and more male <b>dentists</b> used their assistance when restraint was needed. General anesthesia was significantly more prevalent among males than among females (p = 0. 01). One-third of the <b>dentists</b> reported feeling aggression toward the pediatric patient. Although not statistically significant, more female <b>dentists</b> reported about feeling aggression than male <b>dentists.</b> Most <b>dentists</b> felt authority towards the pediatric patient.

40|$|Objectives—The {{challenges}} entailed in dental Medicaid {{programs are}} well documented. To increase {{our understanding of}} Medicaid participation, we surveyed Florida <b>dentists</b> to determine the demographic and practice characteristics of Medicaid-participating <b>dentists.</b> Methods—Our target population was practicing Florida <b>dentists</b> who treat children, including {{those who do not}} currently accept Medicaid {{as well as those who}} do. The final sample (n = 882) included (1) pediatric <b>dentists</b> and (2) general <b>dentists</b> who self-reported that they treat children. Participants completed a survey concerning their Medicaid participation. Analyses included survey-sample weighted chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. Results—More than two-thirds of the sample <b>dentists</b> are not participating in Medicaid and will not consider doing so. Key findings are that Black <b>dentists</b> across the state and Hispanics in South Florida are more likely to participate in Medicaid than other groups of Florida <b>dentists.</b> Pediatric <b>dentists</b> are more likely to be Medicaid participants than general <b>dentists,</b> but nearly one-fifth of the pediatric <b>dentists</b> might quit participation. Non–Medicaid providers are more likely to report not being busy enough in their practice than Medicaid providers. Conclusions—If we are to address the shortage of Medicaid dental providers, increasing our understanding of how to capture the excess capacity among general <b>dentists</b> (the reported lack of busyness) in a way acceptable to <b>dentists</b> and to the State of Florida is an important first step. In addition, dental schools should consider implementing a track dedicated to training students fo...|$|R

Aim: To assess the knowledge and attitude of graduate <b>dentists</b> and postgraduate <b>dentists</b> toward bioterrorism in Dhule city, Maharashtra (India). Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study included graduate <b>dentists</b> and postgraduate <b>dentists</b> in Dhule, Maharashtra, India. The list of <b>dentists</b> of Dhule city {{was obtained from the}} Indian Dental Association office, Dhule branch. Among 110 <b>dentists</b> practicing in Dhule city, 97 responded.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate if orthodontists’ and general dentists’ perceptions of how often, under what circumstances, and by which media orthodontists communicated with general <b>dentists</b> were similar, and to determine if orthodontists were meeting the communication needs of general <b>dentists.</b> Orthodontists (N= 1, 000) and general <b>dentists</b> (N= 1, 000) throughout the United States were randomly selected to participate in a web-based and mailed survey, respectively. The results indicated that the orthodontists communicated with general <b>dentists</b> using the type of media the general <b>dentists</b> preferred to use.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} views of <b>dentists</b> in {{conducting}} smoking cessation counselling in dental practices in Hong Kong. Methods: A mailed questionnaire survey was conducted on {{a random sample of}} 484 Hong Kong <b>dentists.</b> Information on belief, attitudes and confidence of the dentists' roles towards smoking cessation counselling; current practices and perceived barriers in conducting smoking cessation counselling; and personal information of the <b>dentists</b> were collected. Results: 211 <b>dentists</b> completed the questionnaires (response rate: 50. 2 %). Most of the surveyed <b>dentists</b> had positive attitudes on the necessity of guidelines for <b>dentists</b> in conducting smoking cessation counselling. More than half of the surveyed <b>dentists</b> (55. 0 %) asked and recorded the patients' smoking status routinely in their practices. The top three barriers perceived by the <b>dentists</b> were: “lack of patients' motivation” (85. 6 %), “lack of time in consultation” (73. 5 %) and “lack of smoking cessation protocols and guidelines” (68. 1 %). <b>Dentists</b> who were females, younger, had fewer years of practice, graduated in Hong Kong or practiced in non-private hospitals/clinics were more likely to ask and record the patients' smoking status (p< 0. 05). For those surveyed <b>dentists</b> who had a more positive view on belief, attitudes and confidence of the dentists' roles towards smoking cessation counselling, they were more readily to carry out smoking cessation counselling activities (p< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} analgesic prescriptions and the information given to their patients about use of these drugs by the <b>dentists</b> working in Istanbul. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to 250 <b>dentists</b> working in Istanbul. The questionnaires consisted of open-ended questions about analgesic use in dentistry and were handed out directly to <b>dentists.</b> They were analyzed and responses to each question expressed as absolute frequencies. The cases and the analgesics prescribed by <b>dentists</b> for each case were determined by the descriptive statistics method; “frequency”. RESULTS: Responses to questionnaires were received from 130 (52 %) <b>dentists.</b> The most commonly prescribed analgesic was naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is also estimated that <b>dentists</b> did not prescribe selective COX- 2 inhibitors or opioid analgesics. Some <b>dentists</b> reported prescribing more than one NSAIDs for the same patient (n = 11 cases). Although more than 75 % of the <b>dentists</b> reported that they gave information to their patients {{about the use of}} analgesics, the content of the information was limited. DISCUSSION: The results of the questionnaires applied to the <b>dentists</b> showed that <b>dentists</b> most commonly prescribe naproxen for the management of dental pain and they rarely prescribe incompatible analgesic combinations. The results also showed that <b>dentists</b> informed their patients inadequately about analgesic use. Incomplete information given by <b>dentists</b> about drug interactions, storage conditions and price of the prescribed drugs is an important point of the study that may also affect the success ratio of the therapy and the compliance of the patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to measure job satisfaction among registered clinical <b>dentists</b> so as to identify issues which may influence recruitment and retention of <b>dentists</b> in active clinical practice. Methods: A questionnaire measuring dimensions of job satisfaction was mailed to a stratified random sample of 80 private and 80 public sector <b>dentists</b> selected from the 1999 Victorian Dental Register. Results: An adjusted response rate of 60 per cent was achieved (n= 87). Analyses showed significant differences (ANOVA; p< 0. 05) in levels of satisfaction for various dimensions of job satisfaction by gender, age group and practice type. Differences in job satisfaction between male and female <b>dentists</b> related to the personal time dimension. Differences in satisfaction between <b>dentists</b> of different age groups were attributable to six dimensions: relationships with colleagues, relationships with patients, relationships with staff, personal time, community and administrative responsibilities. Differences between levels of satisfaction among private and public <b>dentists</b> related to the autonomy, relationships with patients, pay and resources dimensions. Conclusion: There are various dimensions of job satisfaction that may be pertinent to issues influencing recruitment and retention of <b>dentists.</b> Differences that exist between levels of job satisfaction among private and public sector <b>dentists,</b> between male and female <b>dentists</b> and <b>dentists</b> of different age groups need to be addressed in order to improve recruitment and retention rates of <b>dentists</b> in active clinical practice in different sectors of the dental care system...|$|R

40|$|Background. An {{increase}} in the number of <b>dentists</b> conducting tobacco-use cessation treatment is needed. The authors assessed the effects of high-intensity training (HIT) or lowintensity training (LIT) and reimbursement on general dentists'tobacco-use-related attitudes and treatment behaviors. Methods. The authors randomly selected 265 <b>dentists</b> in three states and assigned them to one of five groups: HIT workshop groups with and without tobacco-use cessation counseling reimbursement, LIT mailed self-study groups with and without reimbursement or a control group. Outcomes at follow-up were dentists' self-reported tobacco-use-related attitudes and behaviorsand patients' reports of dentists'behaviors. Results. Significantly moredentists in the intervention groups reported having positive attitudes and behaviors at follow-up than did <b>dentists</b> in the control group. <b>Dentists</b> inthe HIT groups, however, reported assessing patients' willingness to quit and assisting them with the quitting process significantly more oftenthan did <b>dentists</b> in the LIT groups. Significantly more patients of <b>dentists</b> inthe intervention groups who used tobacco reported receiving advice and assistance from their <b>dentists</b> than did patients of <b>dentists</b> in the control group. Adding reimbursement to HIT or LIT conditions did not provideadditional intervention effect. Conclusion. <b>Dentists</b> trained by means of aworkshop or self-study program used components of a recommended guideline more frequently and felt more positive toward tobacco-use cessation counseling than did <b>dentists</b> in the control group.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the change in Medicaid reimbursements in Texas affected the activity level of the enrolled providers or changed the attitudes of <b>dentists</b> towards Medicaid. ^ Methods. A letter with instructions for completing a survey online was sent to a random sample of 415 general and 325 pediatric <b>dentists</b> (500 <b>dentists</b> originally sampled by Blackwelder plus 240 additional <b>dentists).</b> The survey consisted of 27 questions about Medicaid. ^ Results. Surveys from 98 (13. 2 %) of <b>dentists</b> were collected, with 57 (17. 5 %) from pediatric <b>dentists</b> and 37 (9 %) from general <b>dentists.</b> Our results were compared to the study by Blackwelder et al, which reported attitudes of Texas <b>dentists</b> toward the Medicaid program prior to the reimbursement change. Our data indicates an increase in Medicaid activity among enrolled providers (58. 6 % activity to 94. 8 % activity) with greater percent change among pediatric <b>dentists</b> (61. 8 % to 97. 5 %) compared to general <b>dentists</b> (53. 3 % to 80 %). Also, the proportion of enrolled active Medicaid providers spending greater then 10 % of their time with Medicaid has increased (76. 9 % to 87. 3 %). Furthermore, pediatric <b>dentists</b> spending greater then 50 % of their time with Medicaid increased from 30. 9 % to 38. 5 %, and general <b>dentists</b> from 18. 4 % to 37. 5 %.

40|$|Aim: <b>Dentists</b> have a dual {{professional}} role: {{they have}} to focus on good oral health in their patients and, at the same time, {{they have to}} organise their practices. The aim of this analysis was to assess the extent to which <b>dentists</b> can be seen as business-oriented and/or willing to delegate to dental team members and others, and to investigate which personal and practice characteristics of <b>dentists</b> can be regarded as determinants for these two aspects of their professional role. Method: The data were collected in 2000 by means of a written questionnaire sent to a random stratified sample of 790 <b>dentists.</b> Results: 607 (77 per cent) <b>dentists</b> responded. Multivariate regression analysis showed that business oriented <b>dentists</b> distinguish themselves by having larger practices and a higher level of professional satisfaction. Furthermore, although to a lesser extent, on a regular basis, they treat patients from colleagues in the practice.
