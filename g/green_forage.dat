25|$|Townsend's ground {{squirrels}} {{become dormant}} {{in late spring}} or early summer, after grasses cure. They emerge from dormancy in late winter. Dormancy lasts 7.5 to 9 continuous months. It is shorter in wet years, when <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> is available later in summer, than in dry years.|$|E
25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> to the animals.|$|E

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later I was called out to receive a sheep which, with milk, native beer, some corn, and other things, {{including}} <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> for the donkeys, Bausi had sent for us to eat. Here I may remark that while we were among the Mazitu we lived like fighting cocks. There was none of that starvation which is, or was, so common in East Africa where the traveller often cannot get food for love or money--generally because there is none.|$|E
60|$|For {{over two}} hours {{we went on}} thus till our path brought us from the ravine on to a grassy declivity, across which it wound its way. Here, to our astonishment, we found a fire burning, and hanging above the fire an {{earthenware}} pot, which was on the boil, although we could see no man tending it. The figure signalled to me to dismount, pointing to the pot in token that we were to eat the food which doubtless she had ordered the wild men to prepare for us, and very glad was I to obey her. Provision had been made for the horse also, for near the fire lay a great bundle of <b>green</b> <b>forage.</b>|$|E
60|$|Leaving them {{in charge}} of two old women, I went to see to Anscombe, who as yet could not do much for himself, also to the outspanning of the horses which were put into a cattle kraal, where they lay down at once without {{attempting}} to eat the <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> which was given to them. After this I gave our goods into the charge of the kraal-head, a nice old fellow whom I had never met before, and he led Anscombe to another hut close to that where the women were. Here we drank some maas, that is curdled milk, ate a little mutton, though we were too fatigued to be very hungry, and stripping off our wet clothes, threw them out into the sun to dry.|$|E

40|$|Main {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on tranditonal pig raising(TPR) fed with local feeds effected on reproductivities of sows and productivities of fattening hogs with the motheds of on-the -spot surveys,tests and consulting literatures for backgrounds of agriculture,livestock industry,feed resources and present situations of pig production. Through surveyed on reproductivities of 320 sows and on liveweight gains and feed consumed of 3109 hogs sold, it was shown that on an average,a live litter size of a sow was 10. 57 heads with initial weight of 8. 45 kg/litter when born and was 9. 83 heads {{with the weight of}} 110. 8 kg /litter when weaned at 57. 50 days old. Delivery interval was 180 - 205 days. Duration of reproduction of the sows was 5 - 8 years. With TPR,it could save 20 - 30 percent concentrate stuff but time for slaughtering of hogs was extended to 2 - 5 months;it could save 50 - 60 percent concentrate with the sows. By tested on 41 fattening hogs,the experiment groups basically lived on <b>green</b> <b>forages</b> with a diet containing 12. 15 - 18. 05 percent crude fiber (CF) per kg dry matter (DM) gained 495 g/head per day and 1. 79 kg concentrate, 1. 41 kg roughage and 11. 95 kg <b>green</b> <b>forages</b> should be consumed to gain one kg liveweight,which had 10. 84 Mcal digestable energy (DE) and 480 g crude protein (CP).

40|$|The {{dry matter}} (DM), crude protein (CP), {{ammoniacal}} nitrogen (N-NH 3) and pH values were determined in three pearl millet genotypes silage, after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days ensiling in PVC laboratory silos. Dry matter contents of silage ranged from 23. 12 to 24. 49 %; CP mean levels were 10. 95 % for <b>green</b> <b>forages</b> and 10. 40 % for silage in the 56 th day. In the last evaluation period the N-NH 3 and pH mean values were 8. 75 % and 3. 62, respectively. DM and CP contents remained constant (P> 0. 05) and the N-NH 3 values significantly increased, not tending to stability, along the whole fermentation process.

60|$|In another {{portion of}} the square, {{provisions}} and stock, alive and dead, were being offered for sale, {{for the most part}} by natives of the country. Here were piles of vegetables and fruits grown in the gardens, sacks of various sorts of grain, bundles of <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> from the irrigated lands without the walls, calabashes full of curdled milk, thick native beer and trusses of reed for thatching. Here again were oxen, mules and asses, or great bucks such as we now know as eland or kudoo, carried in on rough litters of boughs to be disposed of by parties of savage huntsmen who had shot them with arrows or trapped them in pitfalls. Every Eastern tribe and nation seemed to be represented in the motley crowd. Yonder stalked savages, naked except for their girdles, and armed with huge spears, who gazed with bewilderment on the wonders of this mart of the white man; there moved grave, long-bearded Arab merchants or Phoenicians in their pointed caps, or bare-headed white-robed Egyptians, or half-bred mercenaries clad in mail. Their variety was without end, while from them came a very babel of different tongues as they cried their wares, bargained and quarrelled.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{discovery}} of vitamins A and D in the 1920s, green feed and sunshine were essential {{to the health of}} poultry. Vitamin D was synthesized from sunlight on the skin (as with humans), while Vitamin A was obtained through <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> plants such as grass. Yards small enough to be fenced economically were soon stripped of palatable <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> and become barren. This is followed by a build-up of manure, parasites, and other pathogens.|$|E

50|$|Horses {{that are}} not {{subjected}} to hard work or extreme conditions usually have more than adequate amounts of vitamins in their diet if they are receiving fresh, <b>green,</b> leafy <b>forages.</b> Sometimes a vitamin supplement is needed when feeding low-quality hay, if a horse is under stress (illness, traveling, showing, racing, and so on), or not eating well. Grain has a different balance of nutrients than forage, and so requires specialized supplementation to prevent an imbalance of vitamins and minerals.|$|R
40|$|The exact and {{reliable}} detection of sugar monomers and fructans provides important {{information for the}} evaluation of carbohydrate metabolism in plants and animals. Using the HPLC method; a large number of samples and single sugars; with both high sensitivity and selectivity; may be analysed. It was shown that the described method—using a Nucleosil column loaded with Pb 2 + ions; a refractive index detector (RID); and HPLC-grade water as the eluent—gives precise and reproducible results regarding the detection of individual sugars in extracts of plants and feed materials. The method can be applied for the detection of sucrose; maltose; lactose; xylose; glucose; galactose; arabinose; fructose; ribose; and mannitol. Furthermore; depending on the plant material; the sugars verbascose; stachyose; and raffinose can be separated. The peaks were well resolved and the reproducibility of the analysis; with 94 – 108 % of recovery (RC) and relative standard deviation (RSD) of up to 5 %; was very good. The method was successfully applied to a variety of <b>green</b> <b>forages</b> and samples of sugar beet pulp silages.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the Morphometric Trait Characteristics of West African Dwarf (WAD) Goats in five Local Government Areas of Abia State. A total of One Hundred & Twenty Three (123) WAD goats (33 bucks and 90 does) were randomly sampled from local farmers in the area (Umuahia – South, Isiala –Ngwa North, Ikwuano, Isuikwuato and Ukwa East LGAs). The study lasted two consecutive months and the experimental animals were raised semi- intensively and fed with fresh <b>green</b> <b>forages</b> and kitchen wastes. Drinking water was provided ad libitum. Goats {{between the ages of}} less than a year and four years were used based on their dentition. The body weight and linear body measurements were determined using a hanging scale and tailor’s tape respectively. The following linear body measurements (LBMs) were taken: Withers Height (WH), Rump Height (RH), Rump Width (RW), and Body Length (BL). Others include Heart Girth (HG), Neck Circumference (NC), Face Length (FL), Neck Length (NL), Ear Length (EL) and Foreleg Length (FLL). Results obtained showed that BWT, RH and HG of WAD goats were significantly (p 0. 05) influenced on all morphometric traits studied. In all parameters studied, Does were superior to Bucks.

5000|$|During fermentation, the silage {{bacteria}} {{act on the}} cellulose and carbohydrates in the forage {{to produce}} volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as acetic, propionic, lactic, and butyric acids. By lowering pH, these create a hostile environment for competing bacteria that might cause spoilage. The VFAs thus act as natural preservatives, {{in the same way}} that the lactic acid in yogurt and cheese increases the preservability of what began as milk, or vinegar (dilute acetic acid) preserves pickled vegetables. This preservative action is particularly important during winter in temperate regions, when <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> is unavailable.|$|E
50|$|Broom {{grass is}} a {{significant}} source of income for subsistence communities, primarily for the women who collect it to manufacture and sell them as brooms across Nepal. In addition to providing cash income when sold as brooms the plant provides a variety of uses to the farmers such as, the leaves provide <b>green</b> <b>forage</b> for livestock, the roots promote soil conservation, and the dried up stems can be used as stakes to support growing vegetables. Broom grass has had a direct impact in preventing frequent landslides, helping retain ground moisture and fertility, and improving soil quality by reducing soil erosion. Broom grass has the ability to crowd out invasive species when intercropped and is beneficial in retaining soil nutrients to regrow vegetation. The grass also possesses numerous medicinal properties that are essential in subsistence communities.|$|E

40|$|Most often, farmers {{consider}} {{red clover}} an unattractive forage {{because of its}} low ensilability. Nevertheless, several in vivo and in vitro experiments also showed advantages of red clover silages such as decreased rumen biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This {{has been attributed to}} a possible protective role of protein-bound phenols, with polyphenol oxidase playing a key role in their formation. This enzyme is active in red clover, but not in other <b>green</b> <b>forages,</b> such as, for example, perennial rye grass. Therefore, the aim was to study the lipid metabolism within red clover/ryegrass mixtures in lab scale silages and during in vitro rumen batch incubations. Ensilability of red clover increased with higher proportions of ryegrass in the silage mixture. However, the lipid-protecting mechanism of red clover does not seem to occur in the co-ensiled ryegrass as lipolysis of polar lipids linearly increased with increasing proportions of ryegrass (86. 0 %, 91. 6 %, 89. 9 %, 93. 1 % and 95. 6 % in 60 -day-old silages with 100 / 0, 75 / 25, 50 / 50, 25 / 75 and 0 / 100 red clover/ryegrass, respectively). Rumen lipolysis and biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and C 18 : 2 n- 6 were negatively related to red clover proportions in the silage mixtures.
