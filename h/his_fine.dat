5|$|Mertens claimed another winners' medal on 22 December 2014 after Napoli's penalty {{shoot-out}} {{victory over}} Juventus in the Supercoppa. Despite being predominantly {{used as a}} substitute, he continued <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> form for Napoli {{over the course of}} the next season and a half, netting 10 goals and contributing 11 assists across all competitions in 2014–15, and 11 more goals in 2015–16. His tally in the latter campaign included a brace in Napoli's joint-largest ever winning margin in the Europa League, a 5–0 win over Belgian side Club Brugge.

5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this work, Day, known for <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed in {{his failure}} to make a {{breakthrough}} in the NBA, Parker turned to Europe to resurrect his basketball career, intending {{to return to the}} NBA after a good season with a European club. Eventually he moved to Israel in the 2000–01 season, where he was signed by the Israeli EuroLeague powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv. Initially, Parker and his wife were intimidated by the occasional bomb attacks in the city, but they soon settled in and Parker was able to focus on his basketball career. Within his first season with his new club, he became one of their most pivotal players. Parker was signed to fill the void left by Doron Sheffer's retirement at the shooting guard position, but ended up featuring as a both scorer and play-maker for Maccabi. He immediately brought to the team his ability to score, rebound, block shots, and even entertain the crowds with slam dunks. In Parker's inaugural season, Maccabi won the Israeli domestic championship and the Israeli National Cup, as well as the FIBA SuproLeague Cup. He continued <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> form for the club in the 2001–02 season, averaging 16.4 points per game and 5.2 rebounds per game as Maccabi again won both domestic titles, and even reached the Euroleague 2001–02 Final Four.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543, his estates were divided among his descendants, and the castle and manor were split. John Levett of Salehurst {{purchased}} the castle in 1588. In 1623, most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir Nicholas Tufton, later Earl of Thanet. His son, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, inherited Nicholas's property on his father's death in 1631; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639. John Tufton was {{a supporter of the}} Royalist cause during the English Civil War, and led an attack on Lewes, and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Haywards Heath. Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643, and more in 1644, as well as fining him £9,000 (£ today). To help pay <b>his</b> <b>fine,</b> Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for £6,000 (£ today) in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell, a Parliamentarian.|$|E
5|$|In early 1190 Geoffrey {{ordered a}} halt to {{religious}} ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing {{to go on the}} Third Crusade, ordered Geoffrey to the king's presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was Justiciar, was hampering Geoffrey's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine, Richard insisted on immediate full payment. When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re-confiscated his lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey's election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey's estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of <b>his</b> <b>fine.</b>|$|E
5|$|It took Đurić three {{personal}} attempts {{before he}} received his Singaporean citizenship on 27 September 2007 as he {{was not on the}} Football Association of Singapore's Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. Despite obtaining his Singapore passport for non-footballing reasons, coach Radojko Avramović called him up to the Singapore national team on 1 November 2007. He made his international debut at the age of 37 years and 89 days against Tajikistan in the first leg of {{the second round of the}} 2010 World Cup qualifiers on 9 November, contributing with an immediate impact by scoring both goals in a 2–0 victory. Đurić started the match following injuries to attacking midfielder Shi Jiayi and striker Indra Shahdan Daud. The result coupled with a 1–1 draw in the second leg meant that Singapore progressed to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. He continued <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> form on the international stage, scoring against Lebanon and Uzbekistan as Singapore finished third in Group 4.|$|E

5|$|Nasri {{continued}} <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> form as season wore on. In the club's Champions League group stage tie against Serbian club Partizan, he assisted on a Sébastien Squillaci {{goal in the}} team's 3–1 victory. In October 2010, Nasri went on {{a streak}} in which he scored goals in three-straight matches. He started the streak by converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Birmingham City. In the club's following match, against Shakhtar Donetsk, Nasri scored on a left-footed volley in a 5–1 victory. He also assisted on a goal in the match. Against Manchester City five days later, he scored the first goal {{and set up the}} third in a 3–0 victory. As a result of his performances in October 2010, Nasri was named the PFA Fans' Player of the Month. In November, Nasri was on the score-sheet again netting the opener in a 3–2 defeat to Tottenham. A week later, he scored a volley in a 4–2 win over Aston Villa.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Holroyd was {{assigned}} the number nine shirt following {{the departure of}} fellow striker Scott Rendell. He started the club's first match of the season, playing the whole game in a 2–0 home defeat to Barrow. Three days later, he scored twice in Cambridge's 3–1 win against Ebbsfleet United, scoring both goals. Holroyd scored his first professional hat-trick four days later, scoring against his former employers, Chester City, as Cambridge came from two goals down to win the match 4–2. One of his goals included an audacious over head kick, 15 yards from goal. Holroyd scored four goals in two games shortly after, netting against Gateshead and Forest Green Rovers respectively. He scored a further two goals in Cambridge's 4–3 home loss to Luton Town in September 2009, taking his goal tally to eleven for the season. His twelfth goal of the season came against Cambridge's local rivals, Histon, Holroyd netting with just nine minutes remaining in a 1–1 draw. A week later, he scored from the penalty spot in Cambridge's 4–0 win against Ebbsfleet United. <b>His</b> <b>fine</b> goalscoring form continued into November 2009, scoring in victories against Kidderminster Harriers and Ilkeston Town respectively. After his goal against Ilkeston Town, Holroyd did not find the net {{until the end of}} December 2009, scoring just before half-time for Cambridge as they lost 2–1 at Mansfield Town. A week later, Cambridge United assistant manager, Paul Carden, said that he expected Holroyd to leave the club in the January transfer window. He subsequently played his last game for the club in Cambridge's 1–0 home defeat to Eastbourne Borough. During {{the first half of the}} 2009–10 season, Holroyd scored 15 goals in 25 games for Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{began the}} 2009–10 season in fine form for Chelsea, netting a penalty during a {{shoot-out}} in the Community Shield over Manchester United, before scoring {{twice in a}} 2–1 victory over Hull City. Drogba earned himself an assist when he was fouled in the penalty box to give Chelsea a penalty, which Frank Lampard converted, in a 3–1 victory over Sunderland. In Chelsea's third {{game of the season}} against West-London rivals Fulham, Drogba scored his third goal of the season. Drogba scored his fourth goal of the season, against Stoke City; Chelsea ended winning the game 2–1 with a late strike from Malouda. He added a fifth at home against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 20 September. He scored his 100th goal for Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat against Wigan Athletic. Drogba was again important in the 2–0 win over title rivals Liverpool on 4 October. He assisted both goals, setting up Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda. He then scored a glancing header against Blackburn on 24 October 2009, bringing his tally to eight goals in eleven appearances, scoring his third goal in as many games. Drogba continued <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> form scoring a header against Bolton Wanderers in a 4–0 win in the League Cup, Drogba went on to score a goal in the same week with another 4–0 win against Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut for Millwall {{in the opening}} game of the 2009–10 season, {{starting}} in the club's 1–1 draw with Southampton; providing the assist for Millwall's equaliser. A month later, he scored his first goal for Millwall in a 3–1 victory over Huddersfield Town. Playing in a deeper role than when at Stevenage, Morison struggled for goals, but made the majority of Millwall's goals throughout October, whilst also netting in a 5–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. In December 2009, he scored a 91st-minute winner in a 3–2 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, and also scored a similar goal in a 4–0 win over Staines Town in the FA Cup. Three days later, Morison scored twice in Millwall's 2–1 victory over Walsall. <b>His</b> <b>fine</b> form through December continued, scoring twice in a 4–4 draw against Charlton Athletic at The Valley. He scored his seventh goal in as many games in a 2–0 win over Bristol Rovers, whilst also assisting the second goal. Morison scored his second goal of Millwall's FA Cup campaign against Derby County at Pride Park in early January 2010; scoring in the 108th minute as Millwall were knocked out 5–3 on a penalty shootout. He provided the assists for both of Millwall's goals in games against Southampton and Oldham Athletic respectively, before scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion; his 11th goal of the season. This was followed up with a brace in a 3–1 win away to Carlisle United, whilst also setting up Millwall's third goal. Morison scored another brace four days later, as Millwall beat Charlton Athletic 4–0. His 17th of the season came {{in front of the}} Sky cameras against Leeds United at Elland Road. Shortly after, Morison scored his 18th goal of the campaign, scoring a header from an acute angle in Millwall's 5–0 win over Stockport County. As a result of <b>his</b> <b>fine</b> goalscoring form throughout March, Morison was named Football League One Player of the Month. Another goal followed for Morison in a 2–1 win away at Colchester United. Morison's 20th goal of the season came in a 2–1 victory over Leyton Orient, scoring Millwall's second goal from the penalty spot. The goal subsequently means that Morison has now scored 20 goals or more in his last six seasons for three different clubs. On {{the last day of the}} season, Morison scored a brace against Swindon Town in a 3–2 victory. Morison's first was a coolly dispatched penalty, whilst he supplied the cross that led to an own goal. Morison's second goal of the game was a half-volley from outside the area; looping into the top right-hand corner of the net. He scored his 23rd goal of the season in Millwall's 2–0 win against Huddersfield Town as Millwall progressed to the League One play-off final, where they beat Swindon Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium; Morison's third successive victory at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was part}} of the {{starting}} eleven in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture {{at the start of the}} 2011–12 season, playing the whole game as the club drew 0–0 at home to Exeter City. In Stevenage's next game, Wilson provided the assist for Stacy Long's goal in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Peterborough United in the League Cup. He also assisted Craig Reid in the club's 3–1 away win at Bournemouth on 16 August 2011. Three days later, on 19 August, Wilson signed a contract extension at the club. He added to his two previous assists by assisting Craig Reid's first goal in the club's 4–2 home win against Rochdale on 3 September. Wilson scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, scoring Stevenage's fourth goal of the match just before half-time. In the same game, Wilson provided the run and pass to assist Darius Charles' second-half goal, Stevenage's fifth of the game. He added a second goal to his goal tally in Stevenage's League Trophy penalty loss against League Two side AFC Wimbledon — opening the scoring after seven minutes when Brett Johnson's clearance cannoned off of Wilson's leg and beat the stranded Seb Brown in the AFC Wimbledon goal. <b>His</b> <b>fine</b> form for the season continued, and he was pivotal in Stevenage's 2–1 home win against Sheffield United, assisting Mark Roberts' goal, before winning a penalty late-on, which was duly converted by Scott Laird. He also set-up Chris Beardsley's 38th-minute strike, to open the scoring, in an eventual 2–1 win against Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way. In the club's last game of 2011, on 31 December, Wilson scored the only goal of the game as Stevenage defeated Wycombe Wanderers 1–0 at Adams Park. The goal came in the 82nd minute of the match, with Wilson powerfully beating Nikki Bull from close-range following Luke Freeman's precise cross. He was also on hand to score two of Stevenage's five goals in a 5–1 victory against Rochdale at Spotland on 14 January 2012. Both of Wilson's goals came in the second-half; the first came shortly after the interval, when he ran onto Chris Beardsley's rolled pass to fire the ball into the net, with his second coming after he ran onto Mark Roberts' clearance to calmly beat Péter Kurucz in the Rochdale goal. Wilson scored one further goal during the campaign, scoring a diving header in injury-time in a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic at Broadhall Way. It took Wilson's goal tally to six for the season, with the player being ever-present during the campaign under both Westley and new manager Gary Smith, playing in all 56 of the club's games, as Stevenage narrowly lost in the play-off semi-finals.|$|E
