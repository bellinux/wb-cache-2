Low carbon steel (AISI 5120 H steel) was turned with four kinds of physical vapor deposition (PVD) coated cemented carbide tools. The <b>coating</b> <b>films</b> used were TiN <b>coating</b> <b>film</b> and three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum based <b>coating</b> <b>films,</b> namely (Ti,W,Si,Al) N, (Ti,W,Si,Al) C and (Ti,W,Si,Al) (C,N) <b>coating</b> <b>film.</b> (Ti,W,Si,Al) N, (Ti,W,Si,Al) C or (Ti,W,Si,Al) (C,N) is {{a new type of}} <b>coating</b> <b>film.</b> The following results were obtained: (1) The critical load of three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum based <b>coating</b> <b>films</b> was higher than that of TiN <b>coating</b> <b>film.</b> (2) The hardness of three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum based <b>coating</b> <b>films</b> was higher than that of TiN <b>coating</b> <b>film.</b> (3) In cutting low carbon steel, the wear progress of three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum based <b>coating</b> <b>film</b> tools was slower than that of the TiN coated tool.

40|$|The in-situ {{analysis}} of pharmaceutical solid dosage forms films {{is of great}} interest to pharmaceutical research, especially with the drive towards continuous processing compared to batch processing requiring either in-line or on-line {{analysis of}} pharmaceuticals. The size and shape of many solid dosage forms impedes their in-situ analysis, particularly when using thermal analysis techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thermal probe methods, which combine atomic force microscopy (AFM) with thermal analysis, permits imaging and characterisation of solid dosage forms in-situ. The goal of this thesis is to perform the in-situ analysis of <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> minitablets through the use of thermal probe methods. Minitablets, which are small diameter tablets, were coated with Opadry I, Opadry II or Surelease, and blends of Surelease and Opadry I and Surelease and Opadry II. In addition the same systems were prepared as cast free films to ascertain differences resulting from the two methods of producing the films. Distinct morphologies were observed between the <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> minitablets and cast free films, particularly for the polymer blends. Thermal analysis by modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC) and localised thermomechanical analysis (L-TMA) of <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> minitablets coated with polymer blends indicating miscibility. However the novel technique of heated tip tapping mode was employed, which was able to resolve separate domains of the polymer blends, which appeared as nanophases. Heated tip tapping mode was further employed to determine changes in the surface morphology of <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> minitablets which had undergone curing. It was successfully used to observe the further coalescence of Surelease and the alteration in the phase distribution of the polymer blends after <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> minitablets had been cured. Polymer films with incorporated pigments were also analysed by thermal probe methods with differences in pigment distribution being observed between <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> minitablets and cast free films. Tapping mode AFM was able to determine the location of pigment particles and the novel use of L-TMA performed in tapping mode allowed thermal analysis without changing AFM mode. Overall the use of AFM combined with thermal probes achieved the aim of performing in-situ analysis of polymer film coats; however further research to correlate in-vivo behaviour of <b>film</b> <b>coats</b> would be of value...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} filler {{used in the}} pellet cores (ie, waxy {{cornstarch}} or lactose) and the enteric <b>film</b> <b>coat</b> thickness on the diffusion and dissolution of a freely soluble drug were studied. Two kinds of pellet cores containing riboflavin sodium phosphate as a model drug, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as a basic filler, and waxy cornstarch or lactose as a cofiller were <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> (theoretically weight increase 20 % or 30 %) with an aqueous dispersion of cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP). The diffusion of riboflavin sodium phosphate in aqueous enteric-coated pellets was investigated using noninvasive confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The in vitro release tests were performed using a USP apparatus I (basket method). Diffusion of drug from the core to the <b>film</b> <b>coat</b> {{was found to be}} greater with lactose-containing pellets than with waxy cornstarch-containing pellets. The dissolution test showed that 30 % enteric-coated waxy cornstarch pellets had a good acidic resistance in 0. 1 N HCl solution for at least 1 hour, while the other enteric pellet formulations failed the test. The waxy cornstarch-containing enteric pellets dissolved at SIF in less than 10 minutes. Confocal images of film-coated pellets showed that waxy cornstarch-containing pellets had less drug dissolved than respective lactose-containing pellets. The observations were further confirmed by measurement of fluorescence intensity of riboflavin sodium phosphate in the <b>film</b> <b>coat.</b> The dissolution test was consistent with the confocal microscopy results. In conclusion, waxy cornstarch as a cofiller in the pellet cores minimizes premature drug diffusion from the core into the <b>film</b> <b>coat</b> layer...|$|R
