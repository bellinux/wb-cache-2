5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E

25|$|The gearbox was a four-speed manual transmission, an {{advanced}} feature on an inexpensive {{car at the}} time. The gear stick came horizontally out of the dashboard with the handle curved upwards. It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> shift pattern: the first {{was back on the}} left, the second and third were inline, and the fourth (or the S) could be engaged only by turning the lever to the right from the third. Reverse was opposite first. The idea was to put the most used gears opposite each other— for parking, first and reverse; for normal driving, second and third. This layout was adopted from the H-van's three-speed gearbox.|$|E
25|$|Brooks {{got off to}} a slow start, {{completing}} {{just one}} pass for two yards in the first quarter, but he heated up {{in the second and third}} periods, engineering one first-half touchdown drive and throwing two scoring passes in the third quarter. By the end of the game, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> mix of numbers, completing just nine of 25 passes for 155 yards but throwing two touchdowns and no picks. Added to his two-touchdown day in a season-opening, 26–20, overtime Saints win in Tampa, Brooks has four TD passes against Tampa Bay this season; the rest of the league has three in 10 games.|$|E

His mother was a mortal woman, Semele, the daughter of king Cadmus of Thebes, and his father was Zeus, {{the king of the}} gods. Zeus's wife, Hera, discovered the affair while Semele was pregnant. Appearing as an old crone (in other stories a nurse), Hera befriended Semele, who confided in her that Zeus was the actual father of the baby in her womb. Hera pretended not to believe her, and planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind. Curious, Semele demanded of Zeus that he reveal himself in all his glory as proof of his godhood.|$|E
25|$|In November 1709, {{when the}} Prussian king Frederick I {{returned}} to Berlin from {{a meeting with}} Russian tsar Peter the Great, the king <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> encounter with his mentally deranged wife Sophia Louise, who in a white dress and with bloody hands pointed at him saying that the plague would devour the king of Babylon. As there was a legend of a White Lady foretelling {{the deaths of the}} Hohenzollern, Frederick took his wife's outburst seriously and ordered that precautions be taken for his residence city. Among other measures, he ordered the construction of a pest house outside the city walls, the Berlin Charité.|$|E
25|$|One night, {{he recalls}} {{the story of}} the princess in the locked tower, and desires to see her. He strikes the tinderbox and sends the dog with eyes the size of teacups to bring her to his apartment. The soldier is {{overwhelmed}} with her beauty, kisses her and orders the dog to return her to the tower. The following morning, the princess tells her parents she has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> dream and relates the night's adventure. The royal couple then watch her closely. When the princess is carried away again, they unsuccessfully use a trail of flour and chalk marks on neighborhood doors to find where she spends her nights. Eventually, her whereabouts are discovered and the soldier is clapped in prison and sentenced to death. The tinderbox got left behind, so he cannot summon its help.|$|E

25|$|On {{the eve of}} the 18th birthday, a half-fairy half-mortal {{girl named}} Lyra <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> dream. All her friends and family were there tonight to {{celebrate}} that special event, and Lyra's grandfather Tangle had prepared an amazing gift for her. But then Lyra heard a whisper, and everyone quickly disappeared. Waking up from that dream, Lyra finds herself alone in her beloved Town of Wish as she is being trapped in a parallel dimension which is very similar to her original one. Guided by the messages left by Tangle plus using her father's magically hidden airship, Lyra breaks out to find Tangle's odd fairy friend simply called the Clockmaker, who is the only stranger could help her get back home, and reunite with family and friends. She finds the Clockmaker in his hideout and thankfully, he agrees to help. Lyra have to find three magical keys in three separately hidden areas; Treehouse Village, Wind Music Island, and Water Collector; to re-activate the Clockmaker's Time Synchronization Machine.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, Prestini was {{sometimes}} laid off by Washington Brick & Lime {{for several months}} at a time. For {{a couple of years}} he drifted and worked odd jobs in Chicago, San Francisco, Mexico, Hawaii, and various other places. Although he had long been sculpting original terra cotta art pieces, he didn't begin painting seriously until his return to Clayton in 1936. He was likely inspired in part by Charles Sater, a fellow terra cotta modeler who did religious-themed oil paintings. Prestini's early work was in the Regionalist style popular at the time, but <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> dark cast, reflecting his deep forebodings over the growth of mechanization and the rise of fascism in Europe. In 1940 a series of paintings he called the Pages of History was briefly displayed in the windows of a downtown Spokane stationery store before public complaints over their grim content led to their removal. These same works were better received when he took them to Los Angeles, earning a laudatory article in the Sunday Los Angeles Times.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E

500|$|The trial {{opened on}} 1 June 1891. Ticket holders began queuing at 9:30am, {{and the court}} was full {{half an hour before}} its 11am start time. The prince sat on a red leather chair on a raised {{platform}} between the judge and the witness box; his appearance was the first time since 1411 that an heir to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court. The Pall Mall Gazette stated that [...] "the court presented an appearance which, save for the dignity of its own fittings and its rows of learned-looking law books, might have been taken for a theatre at a fashionable matinée", with society ladies watching proceedings with opera glasses or lorgnettes. The correspondent of The Manchester Guardian described the opening of the case as being [...] "in the presence of a carefully selected and fashionable assembly", while Clarke later wrote that [...] "the court <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> appearance. Lord Coleridge had appropriated half of the public gallery, and had given tickets to his friends".|$|E

I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

500|$|Cameron {{agreed to}} meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Upon meeting him, however, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger who would {{talk about how the}} villain should be played. Cameron began {{sketching}} his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that [...] "he'd make a hell of a Terminator". Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, [...] "Oh some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks." [...] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. He also wrote that [...] "it took [...] awhile to figure out that Jim [...] was the real deal." [...] In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons {{to be able to use}} them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. James Cameron said that [...] "Somehow, even his [...] accent worked... It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lundgren's biggest {{weakness}} as {{a pitcher}} was lack of control. Even in 1907, his best year, Lundgren averaged 4.0 walks per nine innings pitched. In 1909, he averaged 8.3 walks per nine innings before being released. A profile of Lundgren published in 1913 by The Atlanta Constitution discussed his strengths and weaknesses:"He had everything including speed to burn green hickory {{and an assortment}} of curves that would keep a criptograph specialist figuring all night but he was wild as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate the plate with a field glass. ...
