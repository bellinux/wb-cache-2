40|$|Current {{concepts}} in physiology and pathophysiology of lower esophageal sphincteric mechanism are reviewed. With {{recent advances in}} manometric method for more accurate in-vivo human studies combined with in-vivo and in-vitro studies in animal models, there is much information regarding function of this sphincter. Three components of sphincter control have been identified: specialized circular smooth muscle at esophagogastric junction, autonomic nervous system, and probable physiology effects of gastrointestinal hormones, particularly gastrin. Clinical syndromes of sphincteric dysfunction have been identified relative to these three controlling elements. Foods and drugs that adversely effect sphincter pressure have been identified and indicate that anticholinergic agents, <b>fatty</b> foods, <b>chocolate,</b> alcohol, and cigarette smoking may have...|$|R
50|$|Certain {{foods and}} {{lifestyle}} {{are considered to}} promote gastroesophageal reflux, but most dietary interventions have little supporting evidence. Avoidance of specific foods and of eating before lying down should be recommended only to those {{in which they are}} associated with the symptoms. Foods that have been implicated include coffee, alcohol, <b>chocolate,</b> <b>fatty</b> foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods. Weight loss and elevating the head of the bed are generally useful. Moderate exercise improves symptoms; however in those with GERD vigorous exercise may worsen them. Stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol do not appear to result in significant improvement in symptoms.|$|R

40|$|Conching is an {{important}} process designed to improve the flavour and texture of chocolate. The quality and price of the finished product are dependent on {{the duration of the}} treatment. During conching the coarser particles undergo refinement, sugar aggregates are dispersed and all solid particles are distributed within the melted fat. Flavour changes occur due to physical alterations. Specific chemical alterations were found, too. Low boiling compounds were reduced due to the volatility, high boiling fractions of flavour compounds show some chemical reactions. Within milk <b>chocolate,</b> <b>fatty</b> acids are set free and heterocyclic compounds as well as 2 -methyl-ketones are developed. So milky and caramelic taste are influenced. Analytical possibilities are shown to measure conching intensity by means of flavour analysis...|$|R
50|$|Cocoa solids are {{a mixture}} of many {{substances}} remaining after cocoa butter is extracted from cacao beans. When sold as an end product, {{it may also be}} called cocoa powder or cocoa. Cocoa solids are a key ingredient of chocolate, chocolate syrup, and chocolate confections. In contrast, the <b>fatty</b> component of <b>chocolate</b> is cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is 50% to 57% of the weight of cocoa beans and gives chocolate its characteristic melting properties. Cocoa liquor or cocoa mass is a paste of roasted cocoa beans with cocoa butter and solids in their natural proportions. Recipes for chocolate require the addition of extra cocoa butter to cocoa liquor, leading to a cocoa solids surplus and thus a relatively cheap supply of cocoa powder. This contrasts with the earliest European usage of cocoa where, before milk and dark chocolate was popularized, cocoa powder was the primary product and cocoa butter {{was little more than a}} waste product.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rapid extraction method, {{based on a}} matrix solid-phase dispersion technique using diatomaceous earth as solid support and 50 : 50 (v/v) chloroform/methanol as extracting solvent, that can determine 11 free <b>fatty</b> acids in <b>chocolate.</b> The extraction procedure is followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using a normal-bore (4. 6 mm i. d.) C- 18 column and an electrospray interface operating in the negative ion mode. The tandem mass spectra of selected compounds show that charge-remote fragmentation (CRF) mechanisms are occurring; the intensities of the CRF reactions increase with the carbon number and degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids. Average recoveries, evaluated by the standard addition method, vary between 79 - 103 %, and the estimated quantification limits are less than 153 ng/g. The proposed method {{has been used to}} analyse nine chocolate samples from various price ranges, bought from supermarkets. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In parental-supervised diets, {{students}} also usually ingest the proper proportion of foods {{from the different}} dietary groups; once removed from the parental dinner table, many college students do not eat enough fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. This is because when students go off to college, they face an independence that they usually have not experienced before. Many {{have to learn how}} to go out and feed themselves instead of having their parents cook for them. Research has shown that over 60 percent of college students commonly ingest sugary and <b>fatty</b> foods like <b>chocolate</b> and potato chips over fruits and vegetables. Presently, sugar accounts for approximately 20 percent of an American’s diet, which equates to about 90 pounds of sugar per person per year. This explains why a study, conducted by Stephanie Goodwin of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, states that three out of four students don’t eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily, denying students key vitamins C and E, as well as fiber.|$|R
40|$|Chocolate is {{a complex}} {{rheological}} system in which non-fat cocoa particles and sugar particles are enveloped by crystal matrix of cocoa butter. Physical properties of chocolate depend on ingredient composition, method of production and properly performed pre-crystallization phase. In this work, chocolate was produced in an unconventional way, i. e. in a ball mill applying variable refining time (30, 60 and 90 min) and pre-crystallization temperature in chocolate masses (26, 28 and 30 ⁰C). Two types of chocolate were produced: chocolate with 20 % of powdered cow’s milk (R 1) and chocolate with 20 % of soya milk powder (R 2). The quality of chocolate was followed by comparing nutritive composition, 23 polyphenol content, hardness of chocolate, solid triglyceride content (SFC) and rheological parameters (Casson yield flow (Pa), Casson viscosity (Pas), {{the area of the}} thixotropic loop, elastic modulus and creep curves). The aim of this paper is determining changes caused by replacing cow’s milk with soya milk powder in respect of nutritive, rheological and sensory properties, as well as defining optimal parameters: precrystallization temperature and refining time of soya milk chocolate in order to obtain suitable sensory and physical properties identical to those of milk chocolate mass. The results show that replacing powdered cow’s milk with soya milk powder affects the increase in nutritive value of soya milk chocolate. R 2 chocolate mass showed the increase in essential amino acids and <b>fatty</b> acids. This <b>chocolate</b> mass also showed the increase in total polyphenols by 28. 1 % comparing to R 1 chocolate mass. By comparing viscosity, yield stress, shear stress and the area of the thixotropic loop, it can be observed that R 1 chocolate mass represents a more organized and simpler system than the mass with soya milk (R 2), as it shows lower values for all the above mentioned parameters, regardless of the refining time and pre-crystallization temperature. Viscoelastic behavior of R 2 is also evident, as a consequence of soya protein presence. In order to maintain optimal hardness as well as melting resistance of chocolate, in case of R 2 chocolate mass it is necessary to apply pre-crystallization temperature of 26 ⁰C, while for the chocolate mass R 1 it is 30 ⁰C...|$|R
