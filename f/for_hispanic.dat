25|$|In Hispanic {{cultures}} shyness and inhibition {{with authority}} figures is common. For instance, Hispanic students may feel shy towards being praised by teachers {{in front of}} others, because in these cultures students are rewarded in private with a touch, a smile, or spoken word of praise. Hispanic students may seem shy when they are not. It is considered rude to excel over peers and siblings; therefore it is common <b>for</b> <b>Hispanic</b> students to be reserved in classroom settings. Adults also show reluctance to share personal matters about themselves to authority figures such as nurses and doctors.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{background}} {{may contribute}} to prostate cancer risk, as suggested by associations with race, family, and specific gene variants. Men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) with prostate cancer have twice {{the risk of developing}} prostate cancer, and those with two first-degree relatives affected have a fivefold greater risk compared with men with no family history. In the United States, prostate cancer more commonly affects black men than white or Hispanic men, and is also more deadly in black men. In contrast, the incidence and mortality rates <b>for</b> <b>Hispanic</b> men are one third lower than for non-Hispanic whites. Studies of twins in Scandinavia suggest that 40% of prostate cancer risk can be explained by inherited factors.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{may differ}} in how a disease progresses. Black {{men who were}} {{diagnosed}} with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts. The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% <b>for</b> <b>Hispanic</b> men, and 34.4% for Black men. Black men were also {{significantly less likely to}} be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively. However, the reasons for these differences are not clear, and should not be understood as an essential difference between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors.|$|E

25|$|In recent decades, Republicans {{have been}} {{moderately}} successful in gaining support from Hispanic and Asian American voters. George W.

The election of Bobby Jindal as Governor of Louisiana has been hailed as pathbreaking. He is the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first state governor of Indian descent. According to John Avlon in 2013, the Republican party is more diverse at the statewide elected official level than the Democratic Party, including Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.|$|E

500|$|Assimilation is a {{particularly}} difficult process <b>for</b> <b>Hispanic</b> Americans because they have [...] "old countries that are neither old nor remote.

Julie Barak confirms Gonzalez Echevarria’s assertions regarding Latin American immigration and continues on to demonstrate how the privileged, wealthy existence led by the García girls in the Dominican Republic serves to further complicate their process of assimilation. The girls are vastly unaware of their good fortune until they {{are faced with the}} economic hardships of immigration in the United States.|$|E
