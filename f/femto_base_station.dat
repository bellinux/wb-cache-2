30|$|The {{introduction}} of small cells, such as pico- and femtocells, has further increased {{the complexity of}} ICI management. Picocells (PeNB) are managed by the network operator and share spectrum and resources with the larger macrocells (eNB). These small cells are, generally, carefully placed to compensate for heavily congested areas or for poor coverage, e.g. indoors. Picocells share a backhaul connection with macrocells and can thus {{communicate with each other}} and allow for synchronization and coordination. Femtocells (HeNB), on the other hand, are small cells owned and managed by private customers and are generally designed to be indoor access points [10]. Communication between macro- (pico-) and femtocells is not envisioned, and hence, coordination between the two layers is impossible [11]. In order to mitigate interference from <b>femto</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> different strategies have been presented. One way would be to utilize orthogonal spectrum for the two layers, in a way similar to fractional FR, at the cost of spectral efficiency [12]. To maximize spectral efficiency, then macro and <b>femto</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> have to work in shared spectrum (or co-channel deployment), interfering with each other. Kosta et al.

An elementary solution to the interference mitigation problem is to restrict transmission of pilot signals by <b>femto</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> (BSs) which have no serving subscribers, i. e. idle listening state operation. However, the implementation of the idle listening state in a femto BS opens a possibility of having a problem in location update because a femto BS in idle listening state and a user equipment (UE) in idle mode are not able to communicate with each other.
