500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I hope you have a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because no one wants to see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E

5000|$|David Geffen {{played to}} Glenn Frey a demo of three songs by Tom Waits; Frey loved this song {{and took it}} to Henley {{suggesting}} that they split the vocals on the song. Frey said: [...] "It’s such a car thing. Your first car is like your first apartment. You had a mobile studio apartment! “Ol’ 55” was so Southern California, and yet there was some Detroit in it as well.

5000|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the 2004 Charlatans album Up at the Lake, Burgess was living in Los Angeles in the USA, away from the other band members who were still based in England.

5000|$|I was {{initially}} {{drawn to the}} Hudson River School when I learned {{that many of the}} paintings were made specifically to incite a feeling of awe and a desire to experience the new frontier.

Also she {{has the kind of}} spirit and glow that you don't need {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to manufacture, nor could you manufacture for any amount of money. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of stripping away all the elements and having Joy just do her thing."

2500|$|According to actor Gere, {{an early}} {{draft of the}} screenplay, which he read several years ago, {{presented}} the Sumners as suffering from a dysfunctional sexual relationship. It gave Connie some justification for having an affair. According to the actor and to director Lyne, the studio wanted to change the storyline so that the Sumners had a bad marriage with no sex, to create greater sympathy for Connie. Both men opposed the change; Lyne in particular felt that the studio's suggestions would have robbed the film of any drama: [...] "I wanted two people who were perfectly happy. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> totally arbitrary nature of infidelity." [...] The Sumners' relationship was rewritten as a good marriage, with her affair {{the result of a}} chance meeting.|$|R
5000|$|Director J. J. Abrams added {{numerous}} lens flares to the 2009 film Star Trek by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens.

But <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the future was so bright it couldn't be contained in the frame."

5000|$|... 2. [...] "Goodbye (She Quietly Says)": I had {{a line in}} my head. [...] "There was no tempest in the tea." [...] That's {{what led}} me there. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of those kind of goodbyes that people have where nothing is {{happening}} emotionally. It knocks me out when there is nothing on the surface. People are just sitting {{in a coffee shop}} and devastation has happened. They don't articulate their feelings. Instead, they are putting sugar in their coffee and spooning cake. They are having a quiet conversation but meanwhile a life is coming apart.|$|E
5000|$|The strike {{received}} extensive {{local and}} national attention, both positive and negative. In opposition, some women called for the “National Celebration of Womanhood," [...] a day dedicated to women dressing in “frilly," [...] feminine clothing, singing while doing the laundry, and cooking breakfast in bed for their husbands. Other women simply watched the protest, unsure of its implications or what exactly the protest was about. One woman in the crowd was quoted as saying, “I don’t know what these women are thinking of. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of looking delectable and having men whistle at me.” ...|$|E
40|$|My {{journey to}} {{creating}} Nyctophobia and Counting began in Honors 495, {{taught by a}} wonderfully exuberant man, Vincent Pollard, who became intensely involved in each student's project. Even when the course was finished, Pollard would email my classmates and me the call number of books at Hamilton Library that dealt with our individual projects. Throughout Honors 495, I pursued a creative project that involved satirizing the insatiable and materialistic needs of Americans. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea!</b> <b>I</b> drew up thesis maps, outlines, timelines, and even a twenty-five­ page proposal that consisted mostly of drawings. Bright, bold crayon drawings. But I didn't followthroughwiththatbrilliantproposal. Summer arrived and my idea from 495 did not fly off the paper as expected. The flaw: too much planning and too little execution. So, I came up with another great idea. I would delve into a creative nonfiction project...|$|R
5000|$|On the score, Jablonsky said, [...] "I {{met with}} Michael {{before he started}} {{shooting}} 'Transformers: The Last Knight.' He showed me some amazing concept art and explained how the story connects the history of Transformers {{all the way back}} to the times of King Arthur and the Knights of <b>the</b> Round Table. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> because it gave me the opportunity to explore new musical <b>ideas.</b> <b>The</b> storyline allowed me to write melodies that are a bit more 'classical' than I've written for the other Transformers films, which was a lot of fun for me. Another important aspect of the story revolves around massive skyscraper-sized 'horns from hell' that start emerging from the Earth. They look like gigantic animal horns, but no one knows what they are or why they have appeared. I wanted to create an unsettling sense of mystery and tension with the music." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} completely different, something darker and heavier. I also am heavily into old doom metal, and saw that the sound and heaviness of bands like Saint Vitus and Pentagram was very compatible with the more evil and frentic approach of Bathory, Venom and Mercyful Fate. And <b>I</b> just <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of combining it into something both heavy and sinister. (Faustcoven Interview) ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the series, writer Mark Millar explained that he planned to use character ideas that went unused in the first two Ultimates series, saying, [...] "I always liked the idea of doing like five years worth of Ultimates stories, and to me that's 60 issues, but it became 26 issues ... but I had those overhanging ideas. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Tony having a teetotaling older brother who despised him and always wore white suits instead of Tony's dark suits ... I like the idea of going a bit deeper into the characters. You meet Bruce Banner's teachers and Nick Fury's ex-wife. Just seeing what was going on in the background really." ...|$|E
