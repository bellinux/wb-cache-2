5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms <b>here</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.|$|E

25|$|The early Socialist Labor Party, {{influenced}} by {{the father of the}} Social Democratic Party of Germany, Ferdinand Lassalle, argued that the wage gains and improvements of conditions achievable by trade unions were insignificant and ephemeral. Only the capture of the state through the ballot box would enable a restructuring of the economy and society in anything resembling a permanent manner. So long as capitalism existed, wage gains <b>here</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> offset by the pressure of wage cuts there and incomes would be driven down to a subsistence minimum through the inexorable pressure of the market. Thus the political campaign for the capture of the state—winning office for the sake of winning power to enact change—was considered paramount.|$|E

The Middle Portal, largest of the three, was planned to include a chapel made of cobblestones, although the foundation was never even finished. The Inner Portal contained barracks and six houses. Marie Ogden taught that the Inner Portal, where she lived with her daughter Roberta, was located on the exact center of the Earth's axis, and that only those who lived <b>here</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spared the coming calamities of the last days.

2500|$|Many {{counties}} are named after their principal town, and the expected form <b>here</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Durhamshire, however this form {{has never been}} in common use. The ceremonial county is officially named Durham, however the county has long been commonly known as County Durham and as such is the only English county name to be prefixed with [...] "County" [...] in common usage – a practice more common in Ireland. Its unusual naming (for an English county) is explained to some extent by the relationship with the Bishops of Durham, who for centuries governed Durham as a county palatine (the County Palatine of Durham), outside the usual structure of county administration in England. Thus [...] "County Durham" [...] is a shortened form of [...] "County of Durham".|$|E

2500|$|Helms {{articulated}} several understandings, {{derived from}} his working knowledge and experiences as ambassador in Iran.

He quotes Helms, [...] "They have a very different turn of mind. <b>Here</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ladies, dressed in Parisian clothes. ... But before they went on trips abroad, they would ship up to Mashhad in chadors to ask for protection." [...] Helms with his wife had visited the pilgrimage site in Mashhad, 'the tomb of the eighth Imam'. As to the Shah's statecraft, Helms' May 1976 memo observes, [...] "Iranian government and society are highly structured and authoritarian and all major decisions are made at the top. Often even relatively senior officials are not well informed about policies and plans and have little influence on them." [...] In July 1976 Helms send a message to State which, while confident, again voiced various concerns, e.g., about the [...] "inadequate 'political institutionalization'" [...] of the regime. Professor Abbas Milani comments that in 1975 Helms had [...] "captured the nature of the Shah's vulnerability when he wrote that 'the conflict between rapid economic growth and modernization vis-à-vis a still autocratic rule' was the greatest uncertainty about the Shah's future." [...] Milani, looking ahead after Helms' departure, writes that the election of President Carter in 1976 [...] "forced the Shah to expedite his liberalization plans." ...|$|E

He said the response was [...] "somewhat tumultuous." [...] On November 9, 1,000 men had arrived unorganized and so ill-supplied with arms that be deemed it best to direct them to return home. They followed this direction and assured Borland that within a week's time he would have at least 3,000 men at his command. He told them that companies thus organized and prepared would be received into service for 30 days {{from the time they}} reported again to him. Borland added a postscript to this letter, saying that he had just received a report from his scouts that a Federal force of 7,450 was between Reeve's Station and Greenville in Missouri. He told Gen. Polk that the force he had was wholly insufficient for either attack or defense. It should be three times as large or be abandoned altogether; and finally he asked to be relieved of his command.
