When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take anything they can get. Nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.|$|E
500|$|Viewers saw Sunny finding herself {{unable to}} deal with her {{feelings}} for Zeke and their friends trying to encourage the two to begin a relationship. Zeke managed to get Sunny to open up to him about her insecurities and she started to trust him. They later began a relationship. Holy Soap described their relationship saying [...] "After much to-ing and fro-ing, she eventually got together with Zeke". Network Ten describe Sunny and Zeke's relationship as being a [...] "blessing in Zeke's life, and a great help to him". Sunny is also credited with helping Zeke to heal from his past and putting him on the straight and narrow again. Bower called Zeke and Sunny the show's [...] "Romeo and Juliet couple". Of their relationship she said [...] "They come from different cultures and she's got a year as an exchange student, so we play out the Romeo and Juliet thing. How far <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> for their love? Do they love each other? They keep clashing because of their cultural differences".|$|E
2500|$|Ron Paul {{was also}} {{challenged}} for his stance on Iran, and was criticized by Michele Bachmann, who Paul refuted {{by continuing to}} state his position that sanctions are an act of war, {{and the prospect of}} Iran possibly having a nuclear weapon is similar to the war propaganda that preceded the war in Iraq. Paul continued, [...] "I don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. I would like to reduce them because there would be less chance of war. But to declare war on 1.2 billion Muslims and say all Muslims are the same, this is dangerous talk. Yeah, there are some radicals. But they don't come here to kill us because we're free and prosperous. <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to Switzerland and Sweden? That is absurd." ...|$|E

Tell me {{all about}} it,' cried the old hag, holding him closer yet, patting the hand that was drawn through his arm against her other hand, and searching every line in his face with her bleared eyes. 'Come! Begin! I want to be told all about it. What, Rob, boy! You and me can keep a secret together, eh? We've done so before now. Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> first, Rob?' ...|$|R

What are they after? I do not know. They are not after gold. There is no stampede. Besides, they spend plenty of money. But I ask {{questions}} no more. I, too, {{go on and}} on, because I am strong on the trail and because I am greatly paid.|$|E
6000|$|... "What club <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to? I {{called in}} at the Atheneum last night, {{thinking}} to find Radclyffe there, but the hall porter {{told me that he}} never went there now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{not that}} I wonder at, Peter; it's the putting of such splendid work in such dark narrow lanes that surprises me. Why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> {{to so much}} expense {{in such a place}} as this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm wishing my love to you, Misses Brown,' {{returned}} the false Rob, seeking consolation in the glass. 'Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to first was it? Him and her, do you mean?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Well, sir, if {{they are}} that sort of men why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> and enlist in the army instead of {{becoming}} sailors. It {{stands to reason that}} it is because they know that they cannot do work.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{who will}} {{look after the}} other part?" [...] said Aunt Viney grimly. [...] "That {{will have to be}} kept tidy, too; and the {{servants}} for such a house, where in heaven are they to come from? Or <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] {{said the}} young man; [...] "I command thee to tell me, O Zadok! Why {{are the people}} all gone mad this morning, and why do they weep and wail, and why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> crazy when I do but ask them why they are so afflicted?" ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the train}} ran into Bologna Station, {{they were still}} in the {{restaurant}} car. Nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> at once to their seats. Angus had paid the bill. There was three-quarters-of-an-hour's wait in Bologna.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{this was}} <b>done</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> down to the beach, and superintended the landing {{of the men and}} stores, which was carried on until nightfall. Then, when the last boat load was landed, they came up to dinner.|$|R

6000|$|And {{so they go}} on over Jordan {{to fulfil}} their strange destiny, to fight {{their way into the}} promised land, to root out the Canaanite tribes, whose iniquity was full, whose sins had made them a {{nuisance}} not to be suffered on the earth of God.

6000|$|... "Can't say, sur," [...] {{replied the}} {{old man with a}} {{peculiar}} smile; [...] "few miners live to my time of life, much less <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> underground.

6000|$|I shall {{tell them}} to send you the 'Athenaeum' of last week, where I have a 'House of Clouds,'[57] which papa likes {{so much that he}} would wish to live in it {{if it were not for}} the damp.

50|$|When DET-1 {{was formed}} and their {{equipment}} being chosen, they {{decided not to}} use the traditional Marine Ka-Bar nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> with a dagger design as the Marine Raiders had been issued 60 years previously.

6000|$|... “Yes! yes!” {{the boys}} heard him say. Then {{followed}} a pause. “You don’t mean it! When, just now? Was that the noise we heard? Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to?

60|$|<b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> {{there as}} they please without going {{beforehand}} for tickets?--They pass through an introductory examination, which is not severe in any way, but merely shows {{that they are able}} to take advantage of the classes there; of course they pay a certain sum, which is not at all, at present, I believe, supporting to the college, for every class, just to insure their paying attention to it.|$|E
60|$|CHORUS Enviable colour of breath, {{wonder of}} clouds that fade along the sky {{that was our}} {{accustomed}} dwelling; hearing the sky-bird, accustomed and well accustomed, hearing the voices grow fewer, the wild geese fewer and fewer along the highways of air, how deep her longing to return. Plover and seagull are on the waves in the offing. <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go,</b> or do they return? She reaches out for the very blowing of the spring wind against heaven.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to, {{when they}} spring so fast up there,' asked Barnaby; 'eh? Why do they tread so closely on each other's heels, {{and why are}} they always in a hurry--which is what you blame me for, when I only take pattern by these busy folk about me? More of 'em! {{catching}} to each other's skirts; and {{as fast as they}} go, others come! What a merry dance it is! I would that Grip and I could frisk like that!' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then that}} pair went off together, {{fighting}} {{their own little}} battle on that head, as turtle-doves will sometimes <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> <b>went</b> off, and Bernard was left with Bell standing together over the ha-ha fence which divides the garden {{at the back of}} the house from the field.|$|R

6000|$|... "But did {{you come}} upon the thieves at all?" [...] {{continued}} Crystal with eager volubility. [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to for the night?

60|$|Well, said I, seignior, but how <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> {{out of one}} valley into another? and whither <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> at last? He {{answered}} me, those valleys {{are always}} full of pleasant rivers and brooks, which fall from the hills, and are formed generally into one principal stream to every vale: and that as these must have their outlets {{on one side of}} the hills or on the other, so, following the course of those streams, one is always sure to find the way out of one valley into another, and at last out of the whole into the open country; so that it was very frequent to pass from one side to the other of the whole body of the mountains, and not go much higher up hill or down hill, compared to the hills in other places. It was true, he said, there was no abrupt visible parting in the mountains, that should seem like a way cut through from the bottom to the top, which would be indeed frightful; but that as they pass from some of the valleys to others, there are ascents and descents, windings and turnings, sloping up and sloping down, where we may stand on those little ridges, and see the waters on one side run to the west, and on the other side to the east.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. Of course," [...] replied Dear Me. [...] "We {{always are}} the first.

So we get back here before the rest of them, and usually have begun {{housekeeping}} by the time they arrive. My cousin, Chebec the Least Flycatcher, should be here by this time.

60|$|Every {{field on}} that long route was watched by an armed sentinel, {{some of whom}} had fallen asleep, no doubt, but were on hand, nevertheless. This shows what sort of a country modern Attica is--a {{community}} of questionable characters. These men were not there to guard their possessions against strangers, but against each other; for strangers seldom visit Athens and the Piraeus, and when they <b>do,</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> in daylight, and can buy all the grapes they want for a trifle. The modern inhabitants are confiscators and falsifiers of high repute, if gossip speaks truly concerning them, and I freely believe it does.|$|E
60|$|While he lay at {{the bottom}} of the shaft the {{regulators}} placed the parcels taken from the store, in such a manner as to make it appear that he had fallen in by accident, and when this had been <b>done</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> swiftly toward the settlement, regardless of whether their victim lived or died.|$|R
