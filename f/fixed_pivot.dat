The Tilt-A-Whirl was invented in 1926 by Herbert Sellner, who first operated it at {{an amusement}} park in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. More than likely, Sellner discovered its unpredictable dynamics not through mathematical analysis but by building one and trying it out.|$|E

50|$|Two positions: As {{an example}} {{consider}} a task defined by two {{positions of the}} coupler link, {{as shown in the}} figure. Choose two points A and B in the body, so its two positions define the segments A¹B¹ and A²B². It is easy to see that A is a circling point with a center that is on the perpendicular bisector of the segment A¹A². Similarly, B is a circling point with a center that is any point on the perpendicular bisector of B¹B². A four-bar linkage can be constructed from any point on the two perpendicular bisectors as the <b>fixed</b> <b>pivots</b> and A and B as the moving pivots. The point P is clearly special, because it is a hinge that allows pure rotational movement of A¹B¹ to A²B². It is called the relative displacement pole.|$|R
60|$|The Martians wore no clothing. Their {{conceptions of}} {{ornament}} and decorum were necessarily different from ours; {{and not only}} were they evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but changes of pressure {{do not seem to}} have affected their health at all seriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates, our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are just {{in the beginning of the}} evolution that the Martians have worked out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent--the wheel is absent; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot</b> or relatively <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot,</b> with circular motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.|$|E

40|$|The {{vector space}} model (VSM) {{is one of}} the most widely used {{information}} retrieval (IR) models in both academia and industry. It was less effective at the Chinese ad hoc retrieval tasks than other retrieval models in the NTCIR- 3 evaluation workshop, but comparable to those in the NTCIR- 4 and NTCIR- 5 workshops. We do not know whether the lower level performance was due to the VSM's inherent deficiencies or to a less effective normalization of document length. Hence we evaluated the VSM with various pivoted normalizations of document length using the NTCIR- 3 collection for confirmation. We found that VSM's retrieval effectiveness with pivoted normalization was comparable to other competitive retrieval models (for example, 2 -Poisson), and that VSM's retrieval speed with pivoted normalization was similar to competitive retrieval models (2 -Poisson). We proposed a novel adaptive scheme that automatically estimates the (near) best parameters for pivoted document-length normalization based on query size; the new normalization is called adaptive pivoted document-length normalization. This scheme achieved good retrieval effectiveness, sometimes for short (title) queries and sometimes for long queries, without manually adjusting parameter values. We found that unique, adaptive pivoted normalization can enhance <b>fixed</b> <b>pivoted</b> normalizations for different test collections (TREC- 5 and TREC- 6). We also evaluated the VSM with the adaptive pivoted normalization using the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and found that this type of VSM performs similarly to the competitive retrieval models (2 -Poisson) with PRF. Hence, we conclude that the VSM with unique (adaptive) pivoted document-length normalization is effective for Chinese IR and that its retrieval effectiveness is comparable to that of other competitive retrieval models with or without PRF for the reference test collections used in this evaluation.

40|$|Abstract: Tomba (2012) {{introduced}} a technique for construction (n x n) magic squares (when n is odd) using basic Lat in Squares by <b>fixing</b> the <b>pivot</b> element and arranging other elements {{in an orderly}} manner [10]. However, even-order magic squares can’t be constructed using the same procedure because of duplication in diagonal elements. In this paper, a technique for constructing (n x n) magic squares (when n is doubly even) using basic Latin square is developed. Doubly even magic squares are made by fixing the column associated with the elements, adjacent to the pivot element and arranging {{in an orderly manner}} that generates a magic parametric constant (T, known as Tomba’s constant) and sub-magic parametric constants (Ti) and finally derived by minor adjustment on the values of Ti s. The technique can provide weak magic squares for singly even cases. The construction is illustrated with suitable examples.

50|$|Rocker-roller boards add {{a degree}} of {{instability}} to the rocker board that makes them much more challenging for the rider than a rocker board is. Rather than on a <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot,</b> a rocker-roller's board is placed on a cylindrical roller; this fulcrum is a wheel that moves {{in relation to the}} ground and in relation to the board. The board's pivot point shifts back and forth as the cylinder rolls beneath it. In almost all models the two flat ends of the wheel/roller are about as far from each other as the width of the board. In most models the axis of the roller is perpendicular to the board's length. Thus, as the rider's weight moves over the roller, the board both tilts from side to side and also slides sideways. In models whose roller can be placed with its axis parallel to the board's length, the board slides and tilts toward the front and back (if the rider's feet are oriented accordingly).|$|E

Similarly to our previous paper Giri et al. [1], which considered the <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot</b> technique, the main emphasis here is to check the convergence for five different types of uniform and non-uniform meshes. First, we observed that the cell average technique is second order convergent on a uniform, locally uniform and non-uniform smooth meshes. Secondly, the scheme is examined closely on an oscillatory and non-uniform random meshes. It is found that the scheme is only first accurate there. In spite of this, the cell average technique gives one order higher accuracy than the <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot</b> technique for locally uniform, oscillatory and random meshes. Several numerical simulations verify the mathematical results of the convergence analysis. Finally the numerical results obtained are also compared with those for {{the case of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot</b> technique...|$|E

It is shown that the <b>fixed</b> <b>pivot</b> technique is second order convergent on a uniform and non-uniform smooth meshes. Furthermore, it gives first order convergence on a locally uniform mesh. Finally the analysis shows that the method does not converge on a non-uniform random mesh.
