5|$|While other European {{clubs have}} mainly marketed to {{international}} audiences, Bayern {{has focused on}} Germany. Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fifth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's value at US$1.235billion. As a result of Bayern's finals appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League, the club's brand value has reached US$786million, up 59% from the previous year. Among European teams, this <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Real Madrid's US$600million and behind first-placed Manchester United, whose brand is valued at US$853million. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.|$|E
5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E

25|$|As {{explained}} below, long-term {{estimates of}} the length of the tropical year were used in connection with the reform of the Julian calendar, which resulted in the Gregorian calendar. Participants in that reform were only partially aware of the non-uniform rotation of the Earth, but now this can be taken into account to some degree. The amount that TT <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> UT1 is known as ΔT, or Delta T. The table below gives Morrison and Stephenson's (S & M) 2004 estimates and standard errors (σ) for dates significant {{in the process of developing}} the Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} mass is an {{important}} point on an aircraft, which significantly affects {{the stability of the}} aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the {{center of mass}} must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly {{to the point of being}} unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing. If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly so unstable that it is impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a stalled condition.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of a}} sighted guide {{by people}} in this class is {{dependent}} on the specific requirements of the sport. Guides are used in para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing. Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently from for B1 skiers as the skiers in this class have some vision, which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight. The guide may ski in front of the skier and use visual cues to inform the skier of what <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> them on the course. For cyclists in this class, a guide is used with the guide sitting at the front of a tandem bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{increased by}} 308% between 2005 and 2014, {{primarily as a}} result of Thomson Reuters' decision to track a much larger number of Brazilian journals in its database between 2006 and 2008. Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> most of its neighbours. When it comes to impact, Brazil has lost a lot of ground in the past decade. One possible cause may be the speed with which enrolment in higher education has expanded since the mid-1990s, especially as concerns students passing through the federal system of universities, some of which have resorted to hiring inexperienced faculty, including candidates without doctorates.|$|E
25|$|At {{the one to}} go signal, {{the pace}} car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> {{the leader of the}} race will be waved around {{to the rear of the}} field. These cars are not {{permitted}} to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars > Cars 1 or more laps down > Free Pass Car > Wave Arounds > Cars who have received a penalty.|$|E

500|$|Between seconds one and sixteen {{inclusive}} {{past the}} minute, the current difference between UTC and UT1 is transmitted by doubling {{some of the}} once-per-second ticks, transmitting a second tick 100ms after the first. [...] (The second tick preempts other transmissions, but does not get a silent zone.) [...] The absolute value of this difference, in tenths of a second, {{is determined by the}} number of doubled ticks. [...] The sign is determined by the position: If the doubled ticks begin at second one, UT1 <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> UTC; if they begin at second nine, UT1 is behind UTC.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} identified {{version of}} the pursuit or chase is from {{the third quarter of}} the 7th century BC. Next chronologically is the best known version on the François Vase by Kleitias. The number of characters shown on pottery scenes varies with {{the size and shape of}} the space available. [...] The François Vase is decorated with several scenes in long narrow strips. This means that the Troilus frieze is heavily populated. In the centre, (which can be seen at the Perseus Project at ,) is the fleeing Troilus, riding one horse with the reins of the other in his hand. Below them is the vase—which Polyxena (partially missing), who <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him, has dropped. Achilles is largely missing but it is clear that he is armoured. They are running towards Troy [...] where Antenor gestures towards Priam. Hector and Polites, brothers of Troilus, emerge from the city walls in the hope of saving Troilus. Behind Achilles [...] are a number of deities, Athena, Thetis, (Achilles' mother,) Hermes, and Apollo (just arriving). Two Trojans are also present, the woman gesturing to draw the attention of a youth filling his vase. As the deities appear only in pictorial versions of the scene, their role is subject to interpretation. Boitani, sees Athena as urging Achilles on and Thetis as worried by the arrival of Apollo who, as Troilus' protector, represents a future threat to Achilles. He does not indicate what he thinks Hermes may be talking to Thetis about. The classicist and art historian Professor Thomas H. Carpenter sees Hermes as a neutral observer, Athena and Thetis as urging Achilles on and the arrival of Apollo as the artist's indication of the god's future role in Achilles' death. As Athena is not traditionally a patron of Achilles, Sommerstein sees her presence in this and other portrayals of Troilus' death as evidence of the early standing of the prophetic link between Troilus' death and the fall of Troy, Athena being driven, above all, by her desire for the city's destruction.|$|E

2500|$|To find {{how many}} days the civil {{calendar}} <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the Julian in any year from 301 BCE (the calendar is proleptic [...] up to 1582 CE) add 300 to the year, multiply the hundreds by 7, divide by 9 and subtract 4. Ignore any fraction of a day. When {{the difference between the}} calendars changes the calculated value applies on and from March 1 (civil date) for conversions to Julian. For earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. For conversions to the civil date the calculated value applies on and from February 29 (Julian date). Again, for earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. The difference is applied to the calendar one is converting into. A negative value indicates that the Julian date <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the civil date. In this case {{it is important to remember}} that when calculating the civil equivalent of February 29 (Julian), February 29 is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is −4 the civil equivalent of this date is February 24. Before 1 CE use astronomical years rather than years BCE. The astronomical year is (year BCE) – 1.|$|E
