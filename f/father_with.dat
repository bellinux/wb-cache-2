40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{present study}} {{examined}} fathers' and mothers' attitudes toward fathering and fathers' involvement with their infant sons and daughters. Subjects included 42 pairs of parents with infants from upper and middle socioeconomic class families. All subjects {{were of the}} Caucasian race. The Attitudes Toward Fathering Scale and the Father Behavioral Self-Report Questionnaire {{were used to assess}} the subjects' attitudes toward fathering and the degree of fathers' involvement in infant caretaking, respectively. A variety of statistics, including the analysis of variance, Scheffe' Test, Sign Test, and Chi-Square Test, were used in data analyses. When fathers were divided into developmental and less developmental fathering types, results revealed that <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> sons, regardless of fathering type, were generally more involved with their infants than were <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters. However, developmental <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters were generally more involved with their infants than were less developmental <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters. Furthermore, less developmental <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> sons were generally more involved with their infants than were less developmental <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters. When <b>father</b> and mother pairs were divided into developmental, discrepant, and less developmental family groups, results revealed that <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> sons, regardless of family group, were generally more involved with their infants than were <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters. In addition, fathers in developmental families tended to be more involved with their infants than were fathers from discrepant families, followed by fathers in less developmental families. However, while <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters upheld this pattern of <b>father</b> involvement, <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> sons did not. <b>Fathers</b> <b>with</b> sons in discrepant families tended to be more involved with their infants than were fathers from developmental families, followed by fathers in less developmental families. Finally, <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> sons in discrepant families were generally more involved with their infants than were <b>fathers</b> <b>with</b> daughters in discrepant families. Findings obtained in this study were discussed on the basis of previous theory and research. Generally, the results indicated that fathers are involved in caring for their infants. Their attitudes toward fathering are related to their involvement in child care. Furthermore, within families, both fathers' and mothers' attitudes toward fathering are important in understanding fathers' involvement in infant caretaking. Finally, the sex of the infant must be considered in understanding the relationship between fathers' and mothers' attitudes toward fathering and fathers' involvement in infant caretaking...|$|R

5|$|Kafka {{was born}} into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today part of the Czech Republic. He trained as a lawyer, and after {{completing}} his legal education he was employed with an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his <b>father,</b> <b>with</b> whom he had a strained and formal relationship.

5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so, in the {{background}} of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their <b>father</b> <b>with</b> a cloak. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's descendants forever. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a long way from God's perfect creation. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.|$|E

5|$|Born in Daviess County, Kentucky, Ford {{attended}} the University of Kentucky, but his studies were interrupted by his service in World War II. After the war, {{he graduated from}} the Maryland School of Insurance and returned to Kentucky to help his <b>father</b> <b>with</b> the family insurance business.

5|$|Born on Korhal IV, the {{scion of}} a {{powerful}} founding family of the Terran Confederacy, Mengsk was a colonel in the Confederate Marine Corps and {{a veteran of the}} Guild Wars, who became a successful prospector after war's end. Though trying to distance himself from the actions of his father, a prominent Korhal senator and vocal dissident against the Confederacy, Mengsk became a revolutionary himself when his father, mother, and younger sister were murdered by Confederate assassins. His activities soon spurred the Confederacy to launch a nuclear attack against Korhal, wiping out its population; Mengsk swore vengeance, and formed a revolutionary group he called the Sons of Korhal. Years of open conflict successfully weakened Confederate control over the fringe worlds, during which he recruited followers such as Sarah Kerrigan, Jim Raynor and Edmund Duke. Raynor and Kerrigan grew uneasy with Mengsk's increasingly extreme methods, namely luring Zerg to attack Confederate targets, leading to Mengsk abandoning Kerrigan to the Zerg on the Confederate capital of Tarsonis (another reason for the latter was Kerrigan had been the assassin that murdered his <b>father).</b> <b>With</b> the destruction of Tarsonis by the Zerg, Mengsk crowned himself emperor and styled himself as a benevolent dictator.|$|E
5|$|Fearing for Shae's safety, Tyrion {{breaks up}} with her and orders her to leave for Pentos. She refuses until he calls her a whore, and {{declares}} that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey. Outraged at her betrayal and finally snapping from years of mockery for his dwarfism, Tyrion demands a trial by combat. Cersei names the virtually undefeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before his execution, Tyrion is released by Jaime to be smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Tyrion decides to confront Tywin before his flight, and finds Shae in his father's bed. Tyrion strangles her to death, and then confronts Tywin on the privy. Tyrion kills his <b>father</b> <b>with</b> a crossbow bolt, and then leaves for Pentos with Varys.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded by}} {{mounting}} campaigns against the rebel barons and deepening his alliance with Theobald. Baldwin of Flanders {{was wounded in}} battle and died in September 1118, easing the pressure on Normandy from the north-east. Henry attempted to crush a revolt {{in the city of}} Alençon, but was defeated by Fulk and the Angevin army. Forced to retreat from Alençon, Henry's position deteriorated alarmingly, as his resources became overstretched and more barons abandoned his cause. Early in 1119, Eustace of Breteuil and Henry's daughter, Juliana, threatened to join the baronial revolt. Hostages were exchanged in a bid to avoid conflict, but relations broke down and both sides mutilated their captives. Henry attacked and took the town of Breteuil, despite Juliana's attempt to kill her <b>father</b> <b>with</b> a crossbow. In the aftermath, Henry dispossessed the couple of almost all of their lands in Normandy.|$|E

On 21 July 1917, Howell was invested with his Victoria Cross and Military Medal by King George V in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. A photograph of the pair together was taken at this time, and later published in the Times History of the War. Promoted to sergeant, Howell returned to Australia on 31 October. Having not adequately recovered from his wounds, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 5 June 1918 on medical grounds. Howell's father and one of his brothers had also served on the Western Front during the First World War; his <b>father</b> <b>with</b> the 54th Battalion and his brother, Frederick, with the 1st Pioneer Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and {{get caught in the}} same accident that creates the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's <b>father</b> <b>with</b> the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{had put a}} {{price on}} Federico Pistrucci's head, as he had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French {{advanced}} towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his <b>father</b> <b>with</b> enough academic achievement that he was allowed to take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually allowed to work at Mango's. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, also taking lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci's carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter λ (lambda) on his creations.|$|E
