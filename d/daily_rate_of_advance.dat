5000|$|Volume 10 of the Soviet {{official}} {{history of}} the Second World War treats the Prague Offensive as a primarily military event, identifying the major military formations involved, their axes of advance, and in some cases, their <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance.</b> Unsurprisingly, the Soviet history praises the operation for the international efforts of Soviet, Polish, Czech, and Romanian soldiers on behalf of [...] "the freedom of the Czechoslovakian People". No mention is made, however, of Stalin's political intentions regarding Czechoslovakia. The final push to Prague during the night of 8-9 May 1945 is presented as having been necessary to relieve struggling Czech insurgents in Prague while the authors could not resist accusing former officers of the prewar Czech Army of abandoning the barricades during combat with the Germans in Prague.|$|E

40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effect of}} low temperature on {{the incidence of}} ischemic heart disease over a 15 -year period was examined. To reduce confounding by other seasonal factors the analysis was restricted to the winter months and {{was based on the}} change in the <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> sudden death at the time of cold snaps (arbitrarily defined as days on which the mean temperature was at least 4. 4 degrees C lower than the day before) and around the time of heavy snowfalls. A statistically significant increase in the <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> sudden death at the time of cold snaps occurred only in men under 65 years of age, and even in this group the effect was of relatively small magnitude (+ 16 %) compared with the large change in rate following heavy snowfalls (+ 88 %). Among persons aged 65 years or over cold snaps had virtually no effect, and only the men in this group showed an increased <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> sudden death following a snowfall. These results suggest that much of the increased frequency of death from ischemic heart disease in winter, particularly among the elderly, must be due to factors other than short-term cold stress...|$|R

30|$|The predatory mites, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oud.) and Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), were {{collected}} from leaves of the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) growing at Hail District, Saudi Arabia, in 2017. Different biological aspects and life table parameters of both predators were evaluated by feeding on three insect egg species, Anagasta (Ephestia) kuehniella (Keller) (Pyralidae), Sitotroga cerealella (Oliv.) (Gelechiidae), and Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Noctuidae), as alternative food sources at 27  °C and 70 % RH. Predators’ developmental times were affected by food type. Duration of life cycle was significantly longer when N. cucumeris was provided with S. cerealella eggs (16.56  days for male and 15.42  days for female) {{than the other two}} kinds of insect eggs. Maximum time of life cycle of N. barkeri occurred for male fed on eggs of S. cerealela (18.82  days), likewise the minimum time was observed for male fed on eggs of A. kuehniella (9.92  days).The fecundity of both phytoseiid mites was the highest (25.06 eggs/♀, with a <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 2.05 eggs/♀/day, for N. cucumeris and 23.26 eggs/♀, with a <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 2.04 eggs/♀/day, for N. barkeri, respectively) by feeding on eggs of A. kuehniella. Fecundity was the lowest (13.37 eggs/♀, with a <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 1.48 eggs /♀/ day and 10.35 eggs/♀, with a <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 0.84 eggs/♀/day for the two predatory mites, respectively) on S. cerealella eggs. Food source affected all the life table parameters of both tested predatory mites. It was concluded that two phytoseiid mite species can be maintained successfully on the alternative food, A. kuehniella eggs, in lab trials whenever the natural prey types are scarce.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} to examine {{the first half of the}} year effect in Chinese stock markets by Statistical Methods. In Chinese stock markets, the stock <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return which was got from the first half of the year (January to June) is {{significantly}} higher than the second half of the year's(July to December). Also, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return of the first half of the year is highr than the second half of the year's while the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return has been classified into two types which are <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return on average and cumulative <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return. The first half of the year effect is independent existence because the stock <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return in the second half of the year is significantly above although classifying the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return from February to June which except January into <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return on average and cu-mulative <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return.

50|$|Demand at {{capacity}} is {{the volume of}} production for a single product item at capacity. It is a fixed value that defines the maximum <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> supply. The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> production. In contrast to Toyota Production System, and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output <b>rates</b> according to <b>daily</b> demand. Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> supply. The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the product item to market demand. A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> than the average over a long range. This will likely affect the resource productivity and inventory levels. A greater mix on the line is able to provide {{a higher level of}} service for any given level of resources and inventory.|$|R
