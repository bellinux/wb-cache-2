Recent reductions in {{the density of the}} filter media in scrubber filter panels have suggested concomitant decreases in dust collection efficiencies and increases in the exposure levels of mine workers to respirable silica dust. A description of the structure and operation of continuous miners with flooded bed scrubbers was presented. The respirable silica collection efficiencies of wire mesh filter panels constructed using 10, 15, 20, or 30 layers of stainless steel wire mesh and of two synthetic filters were examined using both high and low capacity scrubbers with supplying air velocities of 2, 200 or 3, 500 feet per minute at the scrubber filter. The respective collection efficiencies of the 10 and 20 layer filters at the two air velocities were 58 % and 76 %, and 69 % and 84 %. The highest collection efficiencies were measured using the 30 layer wire filter and the two synthetic filter panels composed of nonwoven synthetic fiber and an array of nylon brushes. The relative overall performance of each type of scrubber was determined using data on the silica collection efficiency and the air moving capacity of each <b>filter</b> <b>panel.</b> The 30 layer wire mesh panel and the synthetic filters were the most effective in removing silica dust.

40|$|Underground {{coal mining}} {{companies}} that operate continuous miner sections often {{apply to the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for approval to take extended cuts to depths of up to 40 ft {{as a means of}} improving productivity. Historically, MSHA has granted approval of this practice if the mine has successfully demonstrated the ability to control the roof, methane, and respirable dust while extracting these extended cuts. A key component for controlling dust generated by continuous miners in 40 -ft cuts has been the utilization of flooded-bed scrubbers. These fan-powered scrubbers pull dust-laden air from the mining face and remove respirable dust particles by passing the collected air through a wetted <b>filter</b> <b>panel.</b> The filtered air is then discharged back into the mine atmosphere. To effectively use scrubbers in faces that employ exhaust ventilation, the return ventilation curtain or tubing should be located outby the scrubber discharge on the continuous miner, which results in a setback distance from the face of approximately 40 ft. Over the last several years, MSHA has emphasized that mines demonstrate effective dust control before granting approvals for taking extended cuts with extended curtain setbacks. Each mine operator must successfully demonstrate control of workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 dust exposures in standard 20 -ft cuts before MSHA considers approving extended cuts. The goal of the research conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was to compare dust levels generated in 20 -ft cuts when using traditional exhaust face ventilation without a scrubber to dust levels in 20 -ft cuts when using extended curtain setbacks with a scrubber operating. Dust surveys were completed at three mines, with area and personal sampling conducted to quantify respirable dust concentrations on a cut-by-cut basis. Dust sampling results did not show a statistically significant difference (Wilcoxon two-sample test, 1 = 0. 05) in respirable dust concentrations between these two test conditions (scrubber-on and scrubber-off) at the continuous miner or shuttle car sampling locations at the face.

The study of particle loading characteristics of filter media in the laboratory setting is typically performed under the steady flow conditions, i. e., at the constant particle concentration and flow rate.

The purpose of this work is to apply new estimation methods following two-step procedure as in Badinger et al. (2004). We combine a spatial filtering of variables to remove the spatial correlation (Getis and Griffith, 2002) and suitable estimators for dynamic panels (using first-differenced and system GMM estimators). Our estimations on filtered variables reveal a conditional convergence process between Argentinean provinces and a positive and significant impact of agglomeration variables on growth rate. Hence, our results show that ignoring spatial distortions due to geographic proximity misleads estimations and underestimates the speed of convergence specifically for provinces that are distant from Buenos Aires.

The fibrous HVAC filters were previously rated by the manufacturers according to ASHRAE Standard 52. 2 and ranged from shallow (2. 5 cm) fiberglass <b>panel</b> <b>filters</b> (MERV 4) to deep-bed (12. 7 cm) electrostatically charged synthetic media filters (MERV 16). Measured removal efficiency ranged from 0 to 10 % for most ultrafine particles (UFP) sizes with the lowest rated filters (MERV 4 and 6) to 60 – 80 % for most UFP sizes with the highest rated filter (MERV 16). The deeper bed filters generally achieved higher removal efficiencies than the <b>panel</b> <b>filters,</b> while maintaining a low pressure drop and higher airflow rate in the operating HVAC system. Assuming constant efficiency, a modeling effort using these measured values for new filters and other inputs from real buildings shows that MERV 13 – 16 filters could reduce the indoor proportion of outdoor UFPs (in the absence of indoor sources) {{by as much as}} a factor of 2 – 3 in a typical single-family residence relative to the lowest efficiency filters, depending in part on particle size...|$|R

Under the weakly integrated model, the largest autoregressive root exists in a neighborhood of unity that is wider than T− 1, where T is the time-series dimension of the panel. As T →∞, the AR parameter approaches unity at a rate slower than the local-to-unity process, but faster than the conventional stationary process. The criteria are shown to be inconsistent when the idiosyncratic errors are weakly integrated, regardless {{of the degree of}} integration in the common factors. We show that prewhitening the panel prior to applying the Bai and Ng criteria restores consistency of the estimator. Our findings imply that for stationary panels, the Bai and Ng criteria will overestimate the true number of factors as the serial correlation in the idiosyncratic errors increases holding the sample size fixed.

Broad-scale genetic differentiation between geographically separated populations (including sub-species) was assessed and revealed significant differentiation between all populations (F range =  0. 01 – 0. 28), with the largest divergence observed between the three geographically distant subgroups (QLD, NSW and VIC) along {{the east coast of}} Australia (average F range =  0. 17 – 0. 23). Sub-group divergence appears to be a reflection of an isolation by distance effect and sampling strategy rather than true evidence of sub-speciation. This is further supported by low proportions of AMOVA variation between sub-species groups (11. 19  %). Fine-scale analysis using genome-wide SNP loci and the NETVIEW pipeline revealed cryptic genetic sub-structuring within localised geographic regions, which corresponded to the hierarchical mating system of the species. High levels of genome-wide SNP heterozygosity were observed amongst all populations (He =  0. 25 – 0. 35), and when evaluating across the species to other vertebrate taxa were amongst the highest values observed. This illustrates that the species as a whole still retains high levels of diversity which is comparable to other outbred vertebrate taxa for genome-wide SNPs. Insights into the potential for adaptive variation in the koala were also gained using outlier analysis of genome-wide SNPs. A total of 10 putative outlier SNPs were identified indicating the high likelihood of local adaptations within populations and regions. This is the first use of genome-wide markers to assess population differentiation at a broad-scale in the koala and the first time that sex-linked SNPs have been identified in this species. The application of this novel genomic resource to populations across the species range will provide in-depth information allowing informed conservation priorities and management plans for in situ koalas across Australia and ex situ around the world...|$|R
40|$|The water {{purification}} {{systems have been}} hardly used for agricultural purpose due to their complicated compositions and high costs for farmers, while only simple filtrations have been applied to irrigation systems {{in order to prevent}} the system from clogging problems. This study therefore developed a clean water supplying system, the Filter-Disinfection-Adsorption (FDA) system, especially for greenhouse cultivation of where low quality of water is available. This system has also been produced for providing convenience water to farmers in the areas of no water supply service systems for the purpose of washing their bodies or agricultural machineries after farm work. The FDA system consists of three stages of purification processes with an integral module, including disk and teflon filtrations and Ultraviolet (UV) sterilization processes. Indoor experiments were undertaken with a trial product of the FDA system to test its performance. The operation test of the process was performed as well as the condition check of each item including UV module, <b>filters,</b> control <b>panel,</b> pump, valves, etc. The results shows good performance of each test with no critical problems. The initial and maintenance costs were also analysed with other purification systems. From th...|$|R
30|$|Both the QD {{glass tube}} and QD films provide wide color gamut when applied in a LCD display {{and the range}} of color gamut will be {{strongly}} depend on the QD materials, especially the QDs with narrow FWHM. A series of QDs with different emission positions were incorporated to QLCD, and the optimized peaks were selected to match the color filter settings of LCD panels. It is known that color <b>filter</b> in LCD <b>panels</b> to some extent will suppress the color purities of QDs because of the absorption overlapping of RGB regions and leakage of impurity light. Thick color filters can avoid overlapping of absorption spectra by eliminating light leakages. In contrast, power consumption increases as panel transmittance is lowered.|$|R
