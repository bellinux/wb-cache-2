25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the State Soccer Council was renamed as the Tasmanian Soccer Association. This period saw the migrant {{communities}} grow to a size where their traditional rivalries from Europe began {{to influence the}} game in Australia, including in Tasmania. Although the new wave brought a new style and flair to the game, it also sometimes tarnished its reputation as those rivalries descended into occasional violence. The older clubs struggled for success, but the 1960s saw Olympia and Launceston Juventus play off against {{each other for the}} Tasmanian football championship on four occasions, Olympia <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of their northern opponents on three of them. The early 1970s saw the rise of Hobart Juventus, who won four state titles between 1969 and 1973, including a staggering 13–5 aggregate score over Riverside Olympic in the two-legged final of 1973. The 1976 State Championship play-off between Rapid and Launceston Juventus proved to be an all-time classic. The first leg finished 3-2 in favour of Rapid, but a 4-3 home win for Launceston Juventus saw the two-legged final finish 6-6 on aggregate, and go to penalties. The ensuing penalty shootout was an incredible 12-11 sudden death win to Rapid. This era also saw the rise of Glenorchy Croatia, who were crowned state champions three times in the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] {{had what}} Hetfield {{described}} as a [...] "wall of guitars"— three rhythm guitar tracks of the same riff played by himself to create a [...] "wall of sound". According to engineer Randy Staub, close to 50 takes of the drums were recorded because Ulrich did not record the song in its entirety, but rather recorded each section of the song separately. Because {{it was difficult to}} get in one take the [...] "intensity" [...] that the band wanted, numerous takes were selected and edited together. Staub mentioned that the producing team spent much time in <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sound from each part of the room and used several combinations of 40 to 50 microphones in recording the drums and guitars to simulate the sound of a live concert. The bass guitar sound also gained importance with Rock; as Newsted states, Metallica's sound was previously [...] "very guitar-oriented" [...] and that [...] "when he [...] came into the picture, bass frequencies also came into the picture." [...] As the first single, [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] was also the first song to be mixed, a task that took roughly ten days because the band and Bob Rock had to create the sound for the entire album while mixing the song.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was {{director}} of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against {{what he saw as}} Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that [...] "they've moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're doing the best for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> product – not petty grudge bearing." [...] Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13m legal case followed which, ultimately, Massow lost.|$|E

2500|$|Sources differ {{regarding}} {{the speed and}} endurance of the LCA. By 1945 the all-up loaded weight of an LCA had risen to 13½ tons, due to the addition of further armour {{and the weight of}} weaponry an infantry platoon expected to carry into battle. As with all wooden vessels after prolonged immersion, weight increased in the LCA and performance consequently fell. The equipment had evolved and so had the personnel. The time of needing a few craft for raiding was past and the time for invasion, for scores of flotillas dawned. Another obstacle to <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> performance out of the LCA was the early war tendency to return ratings to their various barracks who had landing craft and small marine engine training. Unfortunately, the Navy appointed these ratings to duties without regard to the importance of their amphibious skills.

Combined Operations was then able to keep trained landing craft crew until boats became available.|$|E
