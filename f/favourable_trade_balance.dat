This paper investigates the impact of agricultural exports on economic growth in Nigeria using OLS regression, Granger causality, Impulse Response Function and Variance Decomposition approaches.

The Variance Decomposition results also show that a shock to agricultural exports can contribute to the fluctuation in the variance of economic growth in the long run. For Nigeria to experience a <b>favourable</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in agricultural trade, domestic processing industries should be encouraged while imports of agricultural commodities that the country could process cheaply should be discouraged.

We find strong evidence suggesting that changes in the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and each of its components Granger-cause changes in the exchange rate but no evidence indicating a causal link running from the exchange rate to the <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> Our results seem to be rather supportive of the accommodative role of the exchange rate proposed by the modern theory of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> determination and not supportive of the existence of a J-curve in China's <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> Our finding of a bidirectional causal relationship between the real exchange rate and the price variables confirms the presence of a vicious circle hypothesis following currency devaluation. This has important implications for the discussions of impacts of the RMB devaluation on China's <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic {{analysis of the}} <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> to investigate the roles {{of supply and demand}} shocks. It also introduces global shocks in the analysis {{to take into account the}} comovement of income across countries. The results, based on the long-run historical data and a structural VAR analysis, show that, in the U. K., Australia, Canada, and Sweden, domestic and global supply shocks, while dominant causes in long-term and cyclical changes in output, are unimportant for the <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> The <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> is explained mostly by shocks that cause transitory changes in income. Transitory income shocks cause income and the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> to move in opposite directions in all countries except Sweden. The countercyclical behavior of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> seems to be a robust feature in the U. K. and Canada but not in the smaller economies of Australia and Sweden.

40|$|The cost of Marketing in {{a company}} is so {{critical}} that, marketing become costly in International Business, especially when devaluation hit a local currency. The primary {{purpose of this study}} is to find the impact of devaluation on <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in Zimbabwe using the Johansen-Juselius Co integration and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), unit root tests, and impulse response analysis. Quarterly data for the period 1990 to 2005 is used. The result shows that devaluation is effective in improving <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in the long run and there is a co integrated relationship between the real effective exchange rate and <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in the long run. The findings initially revealed that there is a long run relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and exchange rate. Secondarily the real exchange rate is an important variable to the <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> and that devaluation will improve <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in the long run, thus consistent with the Marshall-Lerner condition and finally, the results indicate no J-curve effect in Zimbabwe...|$|R
