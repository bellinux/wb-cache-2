40|$|At high {{pressures}} and temperatures, many molecular solids become unstable and transform into denser extended phases. Recently, {{we have discovered}} evidences for two novel extended phases of carbon dioxide at high {{pressures and}} temperatures: (1) an ionic form of dimeric CO,, C 02 +C 03 *- at 8 - 13 GPa and above 2000 K [I] and (2) a polymeric phase CO,-V above 35 GPa and 1800 K [2, 3]. These extended phases can be quenched at room temperature at low pressures, from which their molecular and crystal structures have been determined. These transitions occur to soften highly repulsive intermolecular potentials via delocalization of electrons at high pressures and temperatures. Based on these and other previous results, we conjecture that three fundamental mechanisms of high-pressure chemistry are <b>ionization,</b> <b>polymerization,</b> and metallization, occurring in high-density molecular solids and fluids.

40|$|Multi-photon {{processes}} are {{the essence of}} nonlinear optics. Optical harmonics generation and multi-photon absorption, <b>ionization,</b> <b>polymerization</b> or spectroscopy are widely used in practical applications. Generally, the rate of an n-photon effect scales as the n-th order autocorrelation function of the incident light, which is high for light with strong photon-number fluctuations. Therefore `noisy' light sources are much more efficient for multi-photon effects than coherent sources with the same mean power, pulse duration and repetition rate. Here we generate optical harmonics of order 2 - 4 from bright squeezed vacuum (BSV), a state of light consisting of only quantum noise with no coherent component. We observe up to two orders of magnitude enhancement in the generation of optical harmonics due to ultrafast photon-number fluctuations. This feature {{is especially important for}} the nonlinear optics of fragile structures where the use of a `noisy' pump can considerably increase the effect without overcoming the damage threshold...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous carbon films {{deposited}} by plasma-based {{processes are}} of increasing importance for tribological applications, e. g. as protective coatings on components or {{in order to}} reduce their friction. However, most plasma-activated CVD and PVD techniques suffer from their poor deposition rate and low economic efficiency. At Fraunhofer FEP, a hollow cathode-based plasma source has been established as a versatile, reliable, and highly efficient tool for plasma pretreatment, plasma-enhanced PVD processes, and reactive gas activation in large volumes. As a further application field, this plasma source has been evaluated for PECVD of amorphous hydrogenated carbon films (a-C:H). Acetylene has been introduced into the hollow cathode plasma as a precursor gas. The plasma composition has been characterized by an energy-resolved ion mass spectrometer. Intense <b>ionization,</b> dissociation, and <b>polymerization</b> effects have been observed, which strongly increase when the argon gas flow rate through the hollow cathode tube is reduced. Moreover, the ion energy distributions show high energy tails up to 100 eV in dependence of the spatial distribution of ion generation. a-C:H films have been deposited on stainless steel and silicon substrates with growth rates up to 1000 nm/min. Nanoindentation measurement of the a-C:H coatings reveal hardness up to 18. 2 GPa. In this paper, film properties and compositions will be discussed and related to the corresponding plasma conditions obtained by energy-resolved ion mass spectrometry...|$|R
