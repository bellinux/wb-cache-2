5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first {{was that he had}} not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|William F. Raynolds {{entered the}} United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, on July 1, 1839 after being {{appointed}} from Ohio.

Raynolds married at a young age; <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> no children.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> with Texas Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as {{an outspoken critic of}} Goldschmidt. The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt's career, including reporters' difficulties accessing records from his time as governor, ultimately led to the revelation of an illegal sexual relationship with a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his time as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt's extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking.|$|E

In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children's Hospital's $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area. Henrik commented that it was something <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> wanted to do since Valter was born.|$|E
5|$|In early 2012, the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection bolstered its {{presence}} within Chongqing as the city's leaders came under investigation. Much {{of the attention}} focused on Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, {{who may have been}} under investigation for his role in a corruption case in Liaoning. Growing scrutiny over the city's wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang. Although details are scarce, several sources have suggested that Wang's resentment against Bo grew amidst the investigations—resentment that was compounded when Wang realized that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> also been targets of wiretapping under Bo's orders.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Icke's {{position}} with Hereford meant that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> {{to sell their}} home, and for several weeks they lived apart, each moving in with their parents. In 1973 Icke found {{a job as a}} reporter with the weekly Leicester Advertiser, through a contact who was a sports editor at the Daily Mail. He moved on to the Leicester News Agency, and through them did some work for BBC Radio Leicester as their football reporter, then worked his way up through the Loughborough Monitor, the Leicester Mercury, and BRMB Radio in Birmingham.|$|E

5|$|After he {{successfully}} completed secondary school in early 1926, {{he joined the}} Reichswehr as a offizieranwärter (officer cadet) on 1 April 1926. He was posted to the 19th Infantry Regiment during which he spent four years commanding a Gebirgsjäger (mountain infantry) platoon. While {{he was with the}} regiment, the Reichswehr was absorbed by the Wehrmacht. Now part of the Gebirgs Brigade, Raithel gained experience as a signals officer and company commander, and was promoted to Hauptmann (captain). With the creation of the 1st Gebirgs Division in April 1938 he was appointed as the adjutant of the 99th Gebirgsjäger Regiment. At the outbreak of war in September 1939 he was an instructor at the mountain infantry school at Fulpmes in the Stubai Alps. He was married and <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural {{feelings of inadequacy}} and insecurity. As {{a product of a}} childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 1905, he {{was married}} to a divorcee, Frances Jane Wyatt, in London. In 1908, he was brought before the courts in {{bankruptcy}} proceedings, owing some ₤5,500. During the hearing he stated that he had been at sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year looking for work. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> one daughter. He was enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in September 1910, having lowered his age and given Auckland as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving his wife and child at their Park Lane home in London and travelling to Sydney, Australia. In the remaining years before the outbreak of World War I he worked as a clerk at a sugar mill weighbridge in Proserpine, Queensland, and while doing so, lived at Kelly's Club Hotel in Brandon, where he formed a close connection to the publican's family.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the first}} series of Cold Feet began in January 1998. Bullen {{continued}} his method of developing storylines based on his own life; <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> their first child {{in the latter half}} of 1997, so he integrated their experiences into the storyline of characters Pete and Jenny, who have their first child in Cold Feets first episode. Throughout 1998, he retained his job at the BBC, working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing Cold Feet. During the second series he cut back to one show per week. By the time of the third series in 2000, he felt confident enough that he would have a future in television that he was able to give up radio presenting completely. He moved from his home in London to Cambridge, where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel {{to open in the}} town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1934, Matthews married Betty Vallance, {{daughter}} of Stoke City trainer Jimmy Vallance, whom he first met on his 15th birthday in 1930 {{on his first day}} as office boy at the Victoria Ground. The couple had two children together: Jean (born 1 January 1939) and Stanley Jr. (born 20 November 1945), who {{went on to become a}} tennis player under the tutelage of John Barrett. He became Wimbledon Boys' Champion in 1962, making him the last English player to do so. He never translated his success into the senior game, though, and instead moved to the United States to run the Four Seasons Racquet Club in Wilton, Connecticut. Jean married Robert Gough, whom she had met at their tennis club. In 1965, Matthews became a grandfather after Jean gave birth to a son, Matthew Gough. She would have two other children — daughters Samantha and Amanda. Gough made Matthews a great-grandfather in 1999 when <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> a son, Cameron. Matthews had six other great-grandchildren.|$|E
