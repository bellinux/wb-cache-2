40|$|This Master Thesis was {{accomplished}} {{during the period}} 20 th August 2007 to 18 th of January 2008 at Volvo Aero Corporation. The Master Thesis was the final moment in the MSc programme in Mechanical Engineering at Lule√• University of Technology. During {{the development of a}} new aero engine family a new Variable Bleed Valve system (VBV-system) was designed, the second phase of this design was to reduce the weight of the components by considering alternative materials and methods of manufacture: thus improving Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). Several concepts were discussed with regards to the VBV- system and one of these was to replace some of the existing metallic (Aluminum & Titanium) components with a composite alternative and the unison ring was considered to be a prime candidate for this study. The challenge in using composites is the complexity of the material. Different mechanical properties and performance can be achieved by different numbers of layers, fiber orientations and choice of fiber and matrix. In order to use composites, a full understanding of the mechanical behavior of the unison ring is required. This resulted in a review study of the existing unison ring. The most important task was to investigate how changes in the unison ring stiffness could affect the opening and closing of the 10 VBV doors, located in the <b>Fan</b> <b>Hub</b> <b>Frame.</b> With the results given in the review study, a concept generation (including basic laminate theory) was made to determine the final concept design. From the concept generation, it was determined that the unison ring should be designed as a sandwich, with composite laminates on top and bottom. Between the two composite laminates foam or honeycomb should be used. The composite material was chosen to be a standard aerospace composite, which are based on long fiber reinforcements (carbon) with epoxy matrix. Most of the fibers are orientated along the unison ring, to keep both tensile stiffness (AE) and bending stiffness along the unison ring as high as possible. To ensure that the composite laminate was fiber dominated, at least 10 % of the fibers and a maximum of 60 % of the fibers were oriented in four different directions. The research performed in this study has been a limited concept study, therefore more studies are needed before a final design can be achieved. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

In order to minimize the spatial curvature of the fan blades and the <b>fan</b> <b>hub</b> length, impeller blades of low-pressure axial fans can be designed with different specific work of elementary stages, so that the specific work of elementary stages is smaller at the hub than at the periphery. This paper presents the operating characteristics of a low-pressure reversible axial fan with straight blade profiles, designed with different specific work of elementary stages.

40|$|A {{multilevel}} optimization approach {{which is}} applicable to nonhierarchic coupled systems is presented. The approach includes a general treatment of design (or behavior) constraints and coupling constraints at the discipline level {{through the use}} of norms. Three different types of norms are examined: the max norm, the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser (KS) norm, and the 1 (sub p) norm. The max norm is recommended. The approach is demonstrated on a class of <b>hub</b> <b>frame</b> structures which simulate multidisciplinary systems. The max norm is shown to produce system-level constraint functions which are non-smooth.

40|$|Axial fans often show adverse flow {{conditions}} at the <b>fan</b> <b>hub</b> and {{at the tip of}} the blades. In the present paper, a modification of conventional axial fan blades with experimental investigation is presented. Patented hollow blades were manufactured from the hub to the trailing edge {{at the tip of the}} blades. They enable the formation of self-induced internal flow through internal passages. The internal flow enters the internal radial flow passages of the hollow blades through the openings near the <b>fan</b> <b>hub</b> and exits through the trailing edge slots at the tip of the blade. The influence of internal flow on the flow field of axial fan and the modifications of aerodynamic characteristics of the axial fan have been studied along with recent patents. An experimental investigation of the interaction of two flows with the flow around hollow airfoil NACA series in a low-speed wind tunnel was studied. The determination of flow structure on the hollow airfoil was performed with computer-aided visualization. With the introduction of the internal flow and interaction with the external flow, a reduction of circulation effects on the fan hollow blade was achieved. The introduction of self-induced blowing led to the preservation of the direction of external flow, defined by blade geometry, and enabled maximal local energy conversion. Aerodynamic characteristic of the axial fan reached higher degree of pressure difference and efficiency through the entire fan working conditions...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} find out {{the extent to which a}} Genetic Algorithm (GA) may benefit from a multiprocessor implementation, considering, on one hand, that analyses of individual designs in a population are independent of each other so that they may be executed concurrently on separate processors, and, on the other hand, that there are some operations in a GA that cannot be so distributed. The algorithm experimented with was based on a gaussian distribution rather than bit exchange in the GA reproductive mechanism, and the test case was a <b>hub</b> <b>frame</b> structure of up to 1080 design variables. The experimentation engaging up to 128 processors confirmed expectations of radical elapsed time reductions comparing to a conventional single processor implementation. It also demonstrated that the time spent in the non-distributable parts of the algorithm and the attendant cross-processor communication may have a very detrimental effect on the efficient utilization of the multiprocessor machine and on the number of processors that can be used effectively in a concurrent manner.

30|$|A {{few studies}} have been devoted to the {{behavioural}} manipulation of orb web building spiders. Eberhard (2000 a, b, 2001, 2013) and Sobczak et al. (2009) studied parasitoids associated with orb web building spiders from the family Tetragnathidae; Gonzaga et al. (2010) described the manipulation of spiders from the family Nephilidae; and Gonzaga and Sobczak (2007, 2011), Eberhard (2013) and Korenko et al. (2014) studied the manipulation of spiders from the family Araneidae. The studies revealed that the manipulated spider modifies the architecture of its web in various ways. The orb web is modified to the ‚Äòcocoon web‚Äô (termed by Eberhard (2000 a, b) for the first time) when some of its components are reduced (e.g. web spiral, radii) and others are reinforced (e.g. radii, central <b>hub,</b> <b>frame)</b> or multiplied (e.g. threads). The cocoon web is stronger and effectively designed to provide more durable support for the wasp‚Äôs cocoon than the normal web (e.g. Eberhard 2000 a, b). The tetragnathid spider Leucauge argyra (Walckenaer, 1841) is manipulated by the larva of Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga Gauld, 2000 to build a web which consists of a low number of radial threads radiating in a plane from a central hub; the architecture of the cocoon web remains two-dimensional (hereafter 2 D) (Eberhard 2000 a, b, 2001). A similar 2 D cocoon web is built by the related species Leucauge roseosignata Mello-Leit√£o, 1943 manipulated by Hymenoepimecis japi Sobczak, Loffredo, Penteado-Dias and Gonzaga, 2009 (Sobczak et al. 2009). A similar 2 D architecture of the cocoon web, but protected by the 3 D structure of the tangle positioned below the hub, was recently described in the spider hosts Leucauge mariana (Keyserling, 1881) manipulated by Hymenoepimecis tedfordi Gauld, 1991 (Eberhard 2013) and Leucauge volupis (Keyserling, 1893) manipulated by Hymenoepimecis jordanensis Loffredo & Penteado-Dias, 2009 (Gonzaga et al. 2014). In contrast, the larva of Eruga gutfreundi Gauld, 1991 induced the same host (L. mariana) to build a completely different three-dimensional cocoon web (hereafter 3 D) (Eberhard 2013).|$|R
40|$|A shake {{test of the}} Large Rotor Test Apparatus (LRTA) was {{performed}} {{in an effort to}} enhance NASAscapability to measure dynamic hub loads for full-scale rotor tests. This paper documents the results of theshake test as well as efforts to calibrate the LRTA balance system to measure dynamic loads. Dynamic rotor loads are the primary source of vibration in helicopters and other rotorcraft, leading topassenger discomfort and damage due to fatigue of aircraft components. There are novel methods beingdeveloped to reduce rotor vibrations, but measuring the actual vibration reductions on full-scale rotorsremains a challenge. In order to measure rotor forces on the LRTA, a balance system in the non-rotatingframe is used. The forces at the balance can then be translated to the <b>hub</b> reference <b>frame</b> to measure therotor loads.

25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor <b>hub,</b> gearbox, <b>frame,</b> and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|R
