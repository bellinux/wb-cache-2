40|$|Point-of-use (POU) {{drinking}} water treatment {{is a common}} method of providing {{drinking water}} in disaster relief situations when critical water infrastructure is damaged. In these cases, POU treatment devices {{can be used to}} treat local water until relief organizations set up more permanent water provision methods. One such POU technology is PŪR® Purifier of Water, a combined coagulation/flocculation and disinfection chemical treatment sachet produced by Procter 2 ̆ 6 Gamble. PŪR® has been shown to treat contaminated water to meet water quality standards and guidelines set by the U. S. EPA for water purifiers and by the World Health Organization and The Sphere Project for emergency relief. However, the standard two-bucket method of use for PŪR® has two primary drawbacks: (1) the need for appurtenances that may not be readily available in disaster relief situations and (2) lack of a means to protect treated water from re-contamination post-treatment. An alternative to the two-bucket method is a waterbag system under development at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. The waterbag is a ten-liter plastic bladder with integrated filter that incorporates an all-in-one approach to drinking water treatment during emergencies. In previous studies, the first version of the waterbag consistently met World Health Organization and The Sphere Project emergency drinking water guidelines, but did not meet the pathogen reduction requirements of the U. S. EPA <b>Guide</b> <b>Standard</b> and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers. A second (Mark II) version, with internal mixing baffles and a microfilter, was developed to overcome the inability of the first design to meet the U. S. EPA guidelines. The main purposes of the research presented herein were to (1) optimize the method of use and baffle configuration for the improved Mark II version of the waterbag, (2) determine ability of the waterbag to treat test waters with challenging initial water quality conditions, and (3) test the ability of the Mark II design and optimized method to meet the U. S. EPA <b>Guide</b> <b>Standard</b> and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers. For the first and second objectives, the main metric of treatment performance was the extent of flocculation, which was characterized by the turbidity of waterbag supernatant after 30 minutes of settling. The waterbag procedure was varied in several ways. The variables tested were mixing duration, mixing motion type, and the effect of a mixing delay. Several waterbag baffle designs were tested to determine the physical configuration of the waterbag which resulted in best turbulence during mixing. In addition, experiments were performed to test the ability of the Mark II waterbag to treat waters with various initial qualities, such as high organic carbon content and elevated E. coli concentrations. The results of these experiments helped to prepare for a final test in meeting the pathogen removal requirements of the U. S. EPA <b>Guide</b> <b>Standard</b> and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers. The procedure determined to be optimal for the Mark II waterbag treatment included five minutes of mixing using rapid 180 ° twisting motions at a moderate frequency of seventy 180 °-twists per minute. The optimal baffle design was a 12. 7 cm-wide internal mixing baffle with two cut circular holes for the promotion of turbulence during mixing. The desired post-treatment chlorine residual was achieved for different durations depending on initial organic carbon concentration. Optimal PŪR® dose to provide pathogen removals required by the U. S. EPA in the presence of Challenge Water conditions was two sachets per 10 L of water to be treated. The optimization of these design and operational procedures led to the ability of the Mark II waterbag to meet the pathogen, turbidity, pH, and non-microbiological constituent removals required by the U. S. EPA, The Sphere Project, and World Health Organization for emergency relief...|$|E
40|$|Relief {{organizations}} and governments strive to provide {{safe drinking water}} to natural disaster survivors as quickly as possible. However, drinking water is typically provided either as bottled water or via mobile water treatment equipment, both {{of which can be}} difficult or expensive to transport rapidly into disaster zones. An alternative is the waterbag point-of-use treatment device developed at Cal Poly that allows survivors to produce safe drinking water from contaminated local sources. The waterbag is a 10 -L bladder designed for use with Procter 2 ̆ 6 Gamble Purifier of Water (PŪR®) sachets, which contain coagulant and chlorine compounds. Following treatment with PŪR®, treated water in the waterbag is flowed through an outlet port to a filter, primarily for parasitic cyst removal. Currently, the commercial version of the waterbag uses an effective but expensive hollow-fiber membrane microfilter (3 ̆e 10 each). This cost will likely decrease the use of the waterbag by relief organizations responding to large disasters. The goal of the present thesis research was to develop a novel, low cost (5), effective, low-profile filter to be used with the waterbag in large-scale disaster relief. This new filter is referred to as an envelope filter due to its geometry and size. Various prototype envelope filters were constructed using layers of nonwoven polypropylene filter cloth. Two types of cloth were used: a nominally-rated 1 -µm pore size cloth and an absolute-rated 1 -µm cloth. The filters tested were both internal and external to the waterbag and of various geometries. Filters were attached to the waterbag and used to filter defined test water after it had been treated with a PŪR® sachet. Test water for design experiments consisted of tap water with addition of standard dust (to increase turbidity) and seasalts (to increase salinity). In addition to this basic test water, mock U. S. EPA Challenge Water # 2 with added bacteria and cyst surrogates (fluorescent microspheres) was used to evaluate the filter prototype designs prior to testing according to U. S. EPA <b>Guide</b> <b>Standard</b> and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers in a commercial laboratory. The filter design and mock challenge experiment results indicated that a 2 -ply filter with one nominal and one absolute layer was the optimal filter design. In the mock U. S. EPA challenge tests, a flowrate of 20 mL/min allowed this filter met the turbidity, bacteria, and microsphere removal requirements determined by the WHO and The Sphere Project for emergency drinking water treatment as well as the U. S. EPA <b>Guide</b> <b>Standard</b> and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers [...] This filter design was further tested using the U. S. EPA Challenge Water # 2 with triplicate waterbags at the U. S. EPA-certified BioVir Laboratories in Benicia, Calif. All three waterbags with envelope filters met the recommendations for turbidity (3 ̆c 5 3 ̆eNTU) and for virus removal (3 ̆e 4 -log removal). Two of the three waterbags met the bacteria and microsphere removal requirements (3 ̆e 6 - and 3 ̆e 3 -log removal, respectively). The failure of one of the prototypes to meet the requirements could have been due to improper setting of valve that throttled the flowrate through the filter or due to a slightly leaking hose pinch valve. Future work should include incorporating more reliable valves and improving the envelope filter design and materials to achieve higher allowable flowrates...|$|E

40|$|Wetland loss due {{to human}} impacts {{is a global}} concern. For certain {{regulated}} activities in the United States, the Clean Water Act § 404 requires replacement of aquatic functions through compensatory mitigation. In spite of the existing mitigation framework and a 2008 Compensatory Mitigation Final Rule updating regulatory guidance, concerns exist regarding {{the effectiveness of the}} compensatory mitigation program. This dissertation contributes to mitigation improvement through three studies. First, we evaluated numbers, sizes, and compensation types of § 404 projects permitted before (2002 - 05) and after (2009 - 13) the Mitigation Rule to determine how its compensation hierarchy was implemented in southern California. Contrary to expectations, the proportion of third party mitigation projects, and of corresponding acres, decreased after the Rule. Within permittee-responsible mitigation, the proportion of off-site projects increased, as predicted. While is it possible the compensation hierarchy influenced these trends, external factors, particularly the national economic downturn, may also have contributed to the patterns observed. Secondly, we developed chronosequence stream restoration performance curves from projects of different ages to illustrate likely developmental trajectories of high-performing restored streams. The curves, developed using California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) data, predicted the time required for projects to achieve reference-level scores for the CRAM index and Hydrology and Biotic Structure attributes, but underestimated the time for projects to achieve the Physical Structure attribute reference level. CRAM-based performance curves could be used to <b>guide</b> <b>standard</b> development, and to predict future project performance. Finally, we developed an aerial imagery assessment method (AIAM) that combines landscape, hydrology, and vegetation observations into one index describing overall ecological condition of non-confined streams. Verification of AIAM demonstrated sites in good condition (as assessed on-site by CRAM) received high AIAM scores, and select components of AIAM and CRAM were highly correlated. AIAM-based time-series trajectories of three projects revealed they improved in condition after restoration, with the most dynamic change over time in vegetation characteristics. AIAM has high potential as an ecological assessment tool to determine restoration status and trajectories, and can be used for restoration management. The findings and tools produced here can improve mechanisms and methods of wetland replacement through compensatory mitigation...|$|E
