5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges <b>from</b> <b>these</b> vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5|$|According to INSEE, the French {{government}} statistical office, between 4 and 5 million French {{residents were}} born or {{had at least}} one parent born in a predominately Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.

5|$|Addax fossils {{have been}} found in four sites of Egypt - a 7000 BCE fossil from the Great Sand Sea, a 5000–6000 BCE fossil from Djara, a 4000–7000 BCE fossil from Abu Ballas Stufenmland and a 5000 BCE fossil from Gilf Kebir.

5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost <b>from</b> <b>these</b> satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|After its release, Inchon {{was never}} again shown in theaters, {{and was never}} {{released}} on videocassette or DVD.

5|$|Although it was {{originally}} believed that neurons could not regenerate in the adult brain, neurogenesis {{has been shown to}} occur in mammalian brains, including those of primates.

5|$|Although {{thallium}} is a modestly abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to be about 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically recoverable <b>from</b> <b>these</b> sources. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater <b>from</b> <b>these</b> plants.|$|E
