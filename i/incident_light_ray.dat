40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the wave nature of light, invisibility devices based on isotropic media cannot be perfect. The principal distortions of invisibility are due to reflections and time delays. Reflections can be made exponentially small for devices that are large in comparison with the wavelength of light.

The paper shows that the time delays do not depend on the directions and impact parameters of <b>incident</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays,</b> although the refractive-index profile of any conformal invisibility device is necessarily asymmetric. The distortions of images are thus uniform, which reduces the risk of detection.

We show that the dispersion relation between the frequency perceived by an observer who is looking at a moving grating and the incident frequency can exhibit some unique features, such as a flat band (i. e., a local minimum). An observer can see the light diffracted into a non-specular diffraction order from a multitude of <b>incident</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> and the angle of incidence of each ray is frequency-dependent, as a consequence, when the grating is moving, each incident ray experiences a Doppler shift in frequency that depends on its angle of incidence. We find that remarkable features appear near a Wood anomaly where the angle of incidence, for a given diffraction angle, can change very quickly with frequency. This means that light of multiple frequencies and incident from multiple angles can be mixed by {{the motion of the}} grating into the same diffracted ray and their frequencies can be compressed into a narrower range. The existence of a flat band means that a moving grating {{can be used as a}} device to increase the intensity of the perceived diffracted light due to spectral compression.

25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. <b>Incident</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of <b>light</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R

For lensing system as an isolated astrophysical object, we derive the dark energy contribution to gravitational potential as a repulsive power-law term, containing a generic equation of state parameter w. We find that it generates w-dependent and position-dependent modification to the conventional light orbital equation of w=- 1. With post-Newtonian approximation, we compute its direct effect for an isolated lensing system at astrophysical scales and find that the dark energy force can deflect the path of <b>incident</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays.</b> We demonstrate that the dark-energy-induced deflection angle Δα_DE^∝ M^(1 + 1 / 3 w) (with 1 + 1 / 3 w> 0), which increases with the lensing mass M and consistently approaches zero in the limit M → 0. This effect is distinctive because dark energy tends to diffuse the rays and generates concave lensing effect. This {{is in contrast to}} the conventional convex lensing effect caused by both visible and dark matter. Measuring such concave lensing effect can directly probe the existence and nature of dark energy. We estimate this effect and show that the current gravitational lensing experiments are sensitive to the direct probe of dark energy at astrophysical scales. For the special case w=- 1, our independent study favors the previous works that the cosmological constant can affect light bending, although our prediction qualitatively and quantitatively differ from the literature, including our consistent realization of Δα_DE→ 0 (under M → 0) at the leading order.

The mode quality (Q) factors versus the width of the output waveguide are calculated for Fabry-Peacuterot type and whispering-gallery type modes in the square cavity. Mode coupling between the confined modes in the square cavity and the guided modes in the output waveguide determines the mode Q factors, which is greatly influenced by the symmetry behaviors of the modes. Fabry-Peacuterot type modes can also have high Q factors due to the high reflectivity of the Au layer for the vertical <b>incident</b> mode <b>light</b> <b>rays.</b> For the square cavity with side length 4 mu m and refractive index 3. 2, the mode Q factors of the Fabry-Peacuterot type modes can reach 10 (4) at the mode wavelength of 1. 5 mu m as the output waveguide width is 0. 4 mu m...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason the}} {{returning}} light is most intense at about 42° {{is that this}} is a turning point - light hitting the outermost ring of the drop gets returned at less than 42°, as does the light hitting the drop nearer to its centre. There is a circular band of light that all gets returned right around 42°. If the sun were a laser emitting parallel, monochromatic rays, then the luminance (brightness) of the bow would tend toward infinity at this angle (ignoring interference effects). (See Caustic (optics).) But since the sun's luminance is finite and its rays are not all parallel (it covers about half a degree of the sky) the luminance does not go to infinity. Furthermore, the amount by which light is refracted depends upon its wavelength, and hence its colour. This effect is called dispersion. Blue light (shorter wavelength) is refracted at a greater angle than red light, but due to the reflection of <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> from the back of the droplet, the blue light emerges from the droplet at a smaller angle to the original <b>incident</b> white <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> than the red light. Due to this angle, blue is seen on the inside of the arc of the primary rainbow, and red on the outside. The result of this is not only to give different colours to different parts of the rainbow, but also to diminish the brightness. (A [...] "rainbow" [...] formed by droplets of a liquid with no dispersion would be white, but brighter than a normal rainbow.) ...|$|R
40|$|Nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are widely}} used for displays employing a twisted nematic and a super twisted nematic structure. Those liquid crystals are useful for sensors of photo, magnetic field, ultrasonic wave, temperature, vibration, etc. In this paper, experimental results are reported on the photoelectromotive force (photo E. M. F.) of the liquid crystal cells with the aligning films by the dipping method for homeotropic and homogeneous alignments of the liquid crystal. The materials {{used in this study}} are ZLI- 1132 as the liquid crystal, methyle yellow as dyestuffs and polyethylene glycol, triton x- 100, lecithin and FD- 150 (surface-active agent) as the aligning agents. The photo E． M. F. are continually recorded by the illumination of an <b>incident</b> <b>light</b> of ultraviolet <b>rays.</b> Main results were as follows. The cell with triton X- 100 and lecithin aligning films indicated the high values of the photo E. M. F. and the cell having the highest values of the photo E. M. F. showed the rapid rise response time. In the case of changing the number of times on the irradiation of the <b>incident</b> <b>light,</b> a reduction of the photo E. M. F. converged at the irradiation of the four times...|$|R
