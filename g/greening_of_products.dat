40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{worldwide}} environmental and green products consciousness, a systematic analytical process to evaluate various alternative {{courses of action}} {{with the objective of}} developing an efficient way to employ scarce resources is critical. The pressures from WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substance) and EuP (Eco-Design Requirements for Energy Using Products) have played an important part in enhancing the <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> We look at the total ownership costs associated with the notebook computer industry over a defined life cycle, and seek to improve profit through better inventory control and efficient customer service. Factors affecting the product life cycle cost and profit will be investigated in relation to the notebook computers In this study, the costs affecting the notebook computer life cycle and its operation process will be studied in light of the overall integrated supply chain design model.

40|$|Cost {{management}} in green supply chain is of crucial importance as green products still often remain in market niches. One {{of the major}} reasons is their significantly higher price in comparison to conventional ones. The <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> implies an ecological optimisation along the entire value-adding process of the product. This greening process is susceptible to cause higher costs on {{all levels of the}} supply chain. These ecological optimisations have important impacts on the design and structure of the chain as a whole. Greening does not merely consist in substituting conventional material through green one, but it incurs two important effects: 1. The objective of providing an economically competitive product to final customer is extended to the objective of an economically and ecologically competitive product 2. The set of involved actors is extended in greening supply chains. Both actors responsible for economic aspects as well those driving ecological optimisation have to be taken into consideration. This implies that diverging interests may not only occur between companies, i. e. in interfirm supply chains, but equally between different departments within companies, i. e. intrafirm supply chains. The challenge of managing costs in greening both interfirm and intrafirm supply chains therefore lies in th...|$|E

40|$|<b>Greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> chains {{has come}} up as an {{important}} means to systematically improve the environmental performance <b>of</b> <b>products</b> from cradle to cradle in Europe and elsewhere. Some experience with inter-firm co-operation aiming at reducing the environmental impacts has been generated in recent years. Most of these experiences involve cooperation between some of the links in product chains, very often stopping at European borders. Problems of market communication, information availability and information costs prevent companies from going beyond these lines. Also, anonymous markets may prevent communication between producers and end-users in the West and supplying firms in developing countries. Only very few documented case studies <b>of</b> global <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> chains are available. Therefore, the challenge here is how to establish interactions with the first links in supply chains. Within the context of South Africa it is of cardinal importance to identify these links to ensure sustainable synergy. European countries are constantly changing the standards <b>of</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to meet}} environmental targets. Moreover, European consumer markets are increasingly sensitive to environmentally sound products. From the perspective of South African suppliers there is an increasing need for interaction in their global product chains. In this conceptual analysis we will present the way that should be followed from both ends <b>of</b> the global <b>product</b> chains.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to address}} the green {{purchasing}} gap by: exploring environmentally conscious consumers’ mental representation of the barriers responsible for the green purchasing gap; assessing which barriers are perceived as the most relevant in hampering the purchase <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products</b> for environmentally conscious consumers; and investigating the relationships among these barriers. Although consumers are increasingly concerned about environmental deterioration, the current market share <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products</b> remains fairly low. Design/methodology/approach – An introspective qualitative study is conducted; 51 environmentally conscious consumers showing a green purchasing gap are interviewed, and the data are analysed with a cognitive mapping technique (Decision Explorer software) and Freeman’ structural indices (UCINET software). Findings – Higher price and scarce availability <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products</b> are the main barriers to green purchasing. However, consumers’ perceptions of price and availability may vary by changing other barriers (e. g. green products displacement inside the store and in-store communication). Originality/value – This work reconstructs the decisional premises of environmentally conscious consumers’ choices to not purchase green products, identifies the most relevant barriers to green purchasing behaviour and the relationships between these barriers. With this knowledge, marketers <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products</b> can focus {{on the most important}} barriers so that interventions in these barriers may change environmentally conscious consumers’ perceptions of other related barriers...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to test and extend the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in green product purchasing settings. Broadly, two motivations—environmental motivations and hedonic motivations—toward purchasing intention <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products</b> with inclusion <b>of</b> situation and issue-specific variables were examined in the study. Data was collected through an online panel survey. A total of 284 eligible data was used for main data analysis. A series of hierarchical regression analyses was conducted based on theoretical and empirical reasons presented in the literature. Findings supported the significant direct predicting role of the three behavioral intention constructs in the TPB. The issue-specific variable, perceived environmental effectiveness, accounted for no significant additional variance in purchase intention <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products,</b> after controlling for the three constructs of the TPB. Although the effect of general environmental motivations, environmental concern and environmental knowledge, in the conceptual model was supported, the results showed differential effects of each environmental motivation on purchase intention <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products.</b> An additional variance of purchase intention <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>products</b> was explained by environmental knowledge, but not by environmental concern when controlling for the three constructs of the TPB and demographics. Among hedonic motivations, consumers who seek novelty had high purchase intentions with and without forming positive attitudes toward purchasing green products. In addition, although consumers with highly adventurous spirits were likely seeking newness in shopping, they were not likely to demonstrate high levels of intention to purchase green products without novelty seeking characteristics or a positive attitude toward purchasing green products.

But how does retailing work to circulate green products? How are <b>green</b> <b>products</b> made part <b>of</b> specific consumption worlds and practices? And does green retailing facilitate the development of more environmentally sustainable patterns of production and consumption? Green retailing: a socio-material analysis offers a critical account <b>of</b> <b>green</b> retailing.
