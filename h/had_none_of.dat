5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was cautious about using important agents to pass over the deception.|$|E
5|$|Many Somerset {{soldiers}} {{died during}} the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000 casualties. War memorials were put up {{in most of the}} county's towns and villages; only nine, described as the Thankful Villages, <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> their residents killed. During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to repel a potential German invasion. The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast, and south through Ilminster and Chard.|$|E
5|$|The L's aim {{throughout}} much of the 19th century was to extend its main line eastward beyond Waterloo into the City of London. Given this, it was reluctant to construct a dedicated grand terminus at Waterloo. Consequently, Waterloo <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the usual facilities expected of a terminus until 1853, when a small block was built on the far east side of the station. In 1854, the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Company opened a private station inside Waterloo that provided services to Brookwood Cemetery. The station was demolished and replaced with a dedicated building in 1902, as part of the reconstruction of Waterloo in the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{conquest of}} Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete. Roman rule lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest {{are the most}} widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era, because of the spirited, but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful, defence of their homelands by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, east of the Gower Peninsula, {{where there is a}} legacy of Romanisation. The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales. Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates. Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver. Roman economic development was concentrated in south-eastern Britain, and no significant industries located in Wales. This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Although Latin became the official language of Wales, the people tended to continue to speak in Brythonic. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes of Wales began to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4thcentury, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} birth control, {{also known as}} {{contraception}} and fertility control, refers to the methods or devices that have been historically used to prevent pregnancy. Planning and provision of birth control is called family planning.

25|$|Certain skills, {{attributes}} and equipment, when strung together, {{can be used}} to great effect.

This would have taken around 6 turns, if he <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these skills.|$|E
25|$|Wales was a {{rich source}} of mineral wealth and the Romans used their {{engineering}} technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver.

Fortuitously, the firm <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> its own capital invested in the stock market and had no investment trusts to protect during the markets decline. In the dark days of the Bank Holiday in 1933, when cash was virtually unavailable, Bache attracted national attention by supplying currency to customers in New York, Detroit, and other cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of Bai Bureh's {{war against the}} British {{is not a matter}} of whether he won or lost the war but that a man who <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> what could be called formal military training was able to show that for a significant number of months he was able to take on the British who were very proud of their great military successes across the globe. The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied in the same way that one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{at the age}} of thirty-seven, Voce played little cricket, but one {{excellent}} {{performance in}} a Test trial led him to be picked for his third tour of Australia for the 1946-47 Ashes series. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of rationing Australia was a 'land flowing with milk and honey' and he soon put on two stone (28 lbs) in weight. Whilst his classic action remained, he <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the venom of old, was overweight and medium-paced, and in a controversial umpiring decision Bradman was given not out after being caught for 28 off his bowling in the First Test. Voce failed to take a Test wicket on the tour and played his last Test match against Australia at Melbourne in 1947, soon after which he announced his retirement from cricket to become county coach. However, so weak was Nottinghamshire's bowling attack, that he played five more matches for them, the last as late as 1952.|$|E

Alan Thomas identified Williams's contribution to ethics as an overarching scepticism about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy, explicitly articulated in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985) and Shame and Necessity (1993), in which he argued that moral theories can never reflect the complexities of life, particularly given the radical pluralism of modern societies.|$|E
500|$|Three {{decades after}} Murrell's death, {{in the late}} 19th century, Morrison visited Hadleigh on a holiday, expressing {{the view that the}} area was [...] "still in the eighteenth century as regards aspect, costume, habits, and mode of thought". He learned about Murrell, and decided [...] "to write a story about him", believing that [...] "some might {{find it hard to believe}} that such a man, {{practicing}} such arts and wielding such influence, could have lived so recently within so short a distance from London". The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward [...] "a short, sturdy old fellow, with ashock head of loose, white hair" [...] who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell, a fictitious account of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for The Strand magazine. It was Morrison's novel that turned Murrell into a national figure and [...] "inflated the name of the old Essex wizard above all others of his craft".|$|E
