5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, since the {{development}} of the top-down methodologies, IA have been used as a basis for {{the development of}} a knowledge audit, which itself in-turn contributes to an organisation’s knowledge management strategy. Once complete, the IA allows examination into where knowledge is produced, where there may be need for further input and where knowledge transfer is required. Furthermore, this analysis develops strategy for knowledge capture, access, storage, dissemination and validation. Dissimilarly to the IA, the objectives of the knowledge audit are to identify any people-related issues which impact the ways in which knowledge is created, transferred and shared and to identify where knowledge could be captured, where it is required and then determine how best to undertake a knowledge transfer as [...] "unlike information, knowledge is bound to a person, organisation or community." [...] Similarities between the knowledge and information audit methodologies can be noted however, as questionnaires, the development of an <b>inventory,</b> <b>analysis</b> of flow and a data map [...] are here again used. The importance of this audit therefore is to understand the strategic significance of an organisation’s knowledge assets to ensure management is focused to those areas it is specifically required.|$|E

40|$|Forest <b>Inventory</b> and <b>Analysis,</b> {{previously}} {{known as}} Forest Survey, {{is one of}} the oldest research and development programs in the USDA Forest Service. Statistically-based inventory efforts that started in Scandinavian countries in the 1920 s raised interest in developing a similar program in the U. S. The U. S. Congress established the research branch of the U. S. Forest Service in 1928, shortly after Dr. Yrjö Ilvessalo, leader of the first Finnish national forest inventory, met with President Calvin Coolidge. Congress charged the Forest Service to find &# 34;facts as may be necessary in the determination of ways and means to balance the timber budget of the United States&# 34;. As a result, Forest Survey maintained a timber focus for much its history. As society&# 39;s interest in forests changed over time, so did information needs. Conflicts over resource allocation and use could not be resolved without up-to-date knowledge of forest status and trends. In response to society&# 39;s needs, the Forest <b>Inventory</b> and <b>Analysis</b> program has evolved from Forest Survey to address diverse topics such as forest health, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, air pollution, and invasive plants, while continuing its mandate to monitor the Nation&# 39;s timber supply. The Forest <b>Inventory</b> and <b>Analysis</b> program collects data on all land ownerships on an annual basis. The data are used to develop reports on a regular basis; reports and raw data are available to the public at no cost. The data are also used by scientists in a growing number of applications. A short history of the Forest Survey is presented with several examples of current research based on Forest <b>Inventory</b> and <b>Analysis</b> data...|$|R

40|$|The <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{radiological}} for graphite {{thermal column}} from Triga Mark II reactor, Bandung has been presented. The age of Triga Mark II reactor {{is more than}} 45 years, therefore the reactor certainly will be decommissioned sooner or later. Before being decommissioned, one important thing that should be done is the <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> of radiological of its all component. The data of the <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> is needed to calculate the radioactive waste, which needed budget for decommissioning. The graphite thermal column {{is the most significant}} solid radioactive waste. The <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> of the radiological for graphite thermal column could be calculated by computer code ORIGIN 2. This study can be concluded that the <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> of radiological for graphite thermal column from Triga Mark II reactor, Bandung, after being shut down for 5 years is H- 3, C- 14, Fe- 55, Mn- 54, Co- 60, Eu- 152 and Eu- 154 for graphite; Al- 28, Fe- 55, Co- 60, Ni- 63 and Zn- 65 for aluminum cover; and Cl- 36, K- 40 and Fe- 55 for boral cover, with total specific activity for inside increment is 1. 87 x 103 Bq/g for graphite and 1. 15 x 104 Bq/g for aluminum; and for outside increment is 2. 43 x 10 Bq/g for graphite; 1. 52 x 102 Bq/g for aluminum and 8. 8 x 10 Bq/g for boral cover.

40|$|The {{life-cycle}} <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> step of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) may currently {{suffer from}} several limitations, mainly {{concerned with the}} use of incomplete and unreliable data sources and methods of assessment. Many past LCA studies have used traditional <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> methods, namely process analysis and input-output analysis. More recently, hybrid <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> methods have been developed, combining these two traditional methods in an attempt to minimise their limitations. In light of recent improvements, these hybrid methods need to be compared and validated, as these too have been considered to have several limitations. This paper evaluates a recently developed hybrid <b>inventory</b> <b>analysis</b> method which aims to improve the limitations of previous methods. It was found that the truncation associated with process analysis can be up to 87 %, reflecting the considerable shortcomings in the quantity of process data currently available. Capital inputs were found to account for up to 22 % of the total inputs to a particular product. These findings suggest that current best-practice methods are sufficiently accurate for most typical applications, but this is heavily dependent upon data quality and availability. The use of input-output data assists in improving the system boundary completeness of life-cycle inventories. However, the use of input-output analysis alone does not always provide an accurate model for replacing process data. Further improvements in the quantity of process data currently available are needed to increase the reliability of life-cycle inventories. 496 Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
