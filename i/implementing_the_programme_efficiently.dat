40|$|BACKGROUND: Providing doctors {{with new}} {{research}} findings or clinical guidelines is rarely sufficient to promote changes in clinical practice. An implementation strategy {{is required to}} provide clinicians with the skills and encouragement needed to alter established routines. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different training and support strategies in promoting implementation of screening and brief alcohol intervention (SBI) by general practitioners (GPs). METHOD: Subjects were 128 GPs, one per practice, from the former Northern and Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, who agreed to use <b>the</b> 'Drink-Less' SBI <b>programme</b> in an earlier dissemination trial. GPs were stratified by previous marketing conditions and randomly allocated to three intensities of training and support: controls (n = 43) received <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> with written guidelines only, trained GPs (n = 43) received <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> plus practice-based training in programme usage, trained and supported GPs (n = 42) received <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> plus practice-based training and a support telephone call every two weeks. GPs were requested to use <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> for three months. Outcome measures included proportions of GPs <b>implementing</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> and numbers of patients screened and intervened with. RESULTS: Seventy-three (57 %) GPs <b>implemented</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> and screened 11, 007 patients for risk drinking. Trained and supported GPs {{were significantly more likely}} to <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> (71 %) than controls (44 %) or trained GPs (56 %); they also screened, and intervened with, significantly more patients. Costs per patient screened were: trained and supported GPs, 1. 05 Pounds; trained GPs, 1. 08 Pounds; and controls, 1. 47 Pounds. Costs per patient intervened with were: trained and supported GPs, 5. 43 Pounds; trained GPs, 6. 02 Pounds; and controls, 8. 19 Pounds. CONCLUSION: Practice-based training plus support telephone calls was the most effective and cost-effective strategy to encourage implementation of SBI by GPs...|$|R

Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 22) were conducted with rehabilitation professionals (n = 28) involved {{in the implementation of}} a physical activity promotion programme. Two additional interviews were conducted with <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> coordinators (n = 2). The study involved 18 rehabilitation organizations <b>implementing</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> that targets people with disabilities or chronic diseases. Organizations were supported in the implementation process by <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> coordinators. Results: Commonly perceived facilitating factors were: involvement of committed and enthusiastic professionals; agreement with their organizations' vision/wishes; the perceived additional value of the programme; and opportunities to share knowledge and experience with professionals from other organizations. Commonly perceived hampering factors were: uncertainty about continuing the programme; limited flexibility; and lack of support from physicians and therapists to <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme.</b> Conclusion: Professionals perceived a heterogeneous set {{of factors that}} facilitate and/or hamper the implementation and continuation of a physical activity promotion programme in rehabilitation.

40|$|In 1997 the Saudi Government took {{a forward}} step to {{implement}} privatisation {{and to promote}} the process and its implementation in different public enterprises. They issued various resolutions and decisions for <b>implementing</b> and managing <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> but <b>the</b> process is moving slowly and rate of the implementation is limited. Implementation of privatisation is related to several matters, such as condition of the enterprise, content of the privatisation strategy, etc. This research concentrates on investigation and analysis of <b>the</b> privatisation <b>programme</b> in Saudi Arabia, with particular reference {{to the process of}} managing and <b>implementing</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme.</b> <b>The</b> main objectives of the study are: (1) to establish the reasons for the delay in implementing; (2) to investigate the barriers hindering the process in several enterprises and the level at which these barriers are hindering the programme; (3) to develop an "Efficient Models" to help the Government in smooth implementation of <b>the</b> <b>programme.</b> <b>The</b> research uses the literature review, survey opinions of a group of the public and private sector managers and various case studies as sources of data for the research. The methodology of the study evaluates whether <b>the</b> barriers to <b>implement</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> in <b>the</b> country lie at the privatisation strategy level or at the enterprise level. It includes investigation of the barriers hindering of <b>the</b> <b>programme,</b> development of a main model and the other models based on analysis of the international experiences and their comparison with the actual implementation of <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> at Saudi Arabia. This study is designed to fill the gap in knowledge about planning and managing privatisation and monitoring the process of implementation. The study develops an "Efficient Models" which makes managing the process clear for all the organizations involved in the process. These models are allowing the Saudi government to implement, manage and monitor the privatisation strategy, employees' matters, restructuring and regulation policy.
