40|$|This paper discusses, from a {{comparative}} perspective, the decentralization {{of education in}} Brazil and Portugal since the 1990 s. Supported on relevant literature and on its legal framework, the researchers seek to investigate the <b>interinstitutional</b> and sociopolitical <b>relations</b> that mediate this process, in Brazil, under the collaboration regime and, in Portugal, among the relations between central and local power. The general conclusion notes that, although both central governments have generalized the decentralization discourse for some time now, {{it seems that the}} level of rhetoric has failed to be effectively overcome, due to a number of advances and setbacks. Attempts have constituted some devolution of power, still marked by the same centralizing logic, outcome of both countries historical and social heritage (their previous dictatorial regime), and currently under the modulation of neoliberal economic policies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to present the main lines of {{arguments}} and discussions among the participants {{of a series of}} four Round Tables on Scientific Support to Energy Transition from a European Perspective hosted by the Joint Research Centre within its European Forum for Science and Industry between July and December 2013. Participants from the energy sector, industry, financial services, consumer organisations and European and Member States authorities held discussions on the key questions outlined below: Integration of renewables: How should renewable energy sources best be integrated into grid and market to make renewable electricity production more responsive to system needs? How and at what costs can the increased need for flexibility of generation and energy demand be provided? Grid operations: Is the traditional focus of networks well placed to fully accommodate the on-going process of energy transition and to provide the reliability of supply in a least-cost approach? How to improve cross-border cooperation? What can be learned from existing initiatives of regional and bilateral cooperation between grid operators and regulators? Would common minimum standards for data quality from power plant operators help to create forecasts to optimise regional balancing power markets? Market design: In order to ensure the reliability of supply, what is the need of coordination in/between Member States for balancing, re-dispatch and storage? How to improve the convergence of renewables support schemes? Which role could European regional markets play in coordinated scenario building in view of asset optimisation? Financing issues: What are the market-based tools able to create the right conditions for investment in generation, transmission and distribution? Which governance framework is needed to trigger more capital for investments? Which are the interactions between energy and financial markets to be taken into consideration in favour of lower electricity prices to consumers? The report intends to contribute to a better science-based understanding of the challenges for the electricity system created by intermittent energy sources and to lead to further analysis of the current energy challenges including political, economic and technological aspects.

40|$|This {{special issue}} follows up on {{a stream of}} recent {{contributions}} on what {{has been identified as}} a particular phase of post-Maastricht European integration: the ‘new intergovernmentalism’ and ‘the intergovernmental union’. This literature considers the European Union’s (EU) core intergovernmental forums for policy coordination, the European Council, the Eurogroup and the Foreign Affairs Council as central to EU decision-making. These bodies perform functions related to policy initiation and implementation which were traditionally associated with the European Commission. Intergovernmentalisation is primarily detectable in new areas of EU activity such as economic governance and foreign affairs which operate mainly outside the community method and in policy sectors which depict a mix of legislative and non-legislative decision-making mechanisms, such as justice and home affairs and energy. More integration is achieved without significant further supranationalisation. These developments affect how the Union’s main decision bodies operate and how <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations</b> are structured...|$|E
40|$|Political {{scientists}} {{have long been}} interested in the issues of separation of powers and <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations.</b> Judicial scholars have primarily examined whether the Supreme Court is influenced by other institutions. We draw on alternative formal models and pose the theoretical and empirical possibility that other branches respond to the Supreme Court’s decisions, due to the Court’s high levels of legitimacy and support among the public. Employing time-series analyses, we find that Congress and the President espouse policies in line with those collectively preferred by the justices. The Supreme Court also is somewhat constrained by policies enacted by elected officials, as the longitudinal policy space exhibits dynamic endogeneity. Our findings lead to critical questions regarding judicial power within the system of separation of powers, which suggests that it would behoove theorists, whether formal or normative, to spend more effort considering the constraints posed by the Supreme Court on the legislative and executive branches.

40|$|Published online: 13 Jun 2016. The {{appointment}} of the President of the European Commission in 2014 {{occurred in the}} context of a novel environment: in constitutional terms, the Lisbon Treaty had introduced a small but significant change, namely the requirement for the candidate proposed by the European Council to be elected by the European Parliament. Politically, the 2014 European elections took place against the background of the eurozone crisis which had polarised opinions about the direction of European integration across the member states. This article develops a framework to assess the impact of this changed environment along two crucial dimensions of EU politics – <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations</b> and party politics. Based on this analysis, the article argues that while there has been gradual change in certain respects, the impact of the Spitzenkandidaten system did not lead to a transformation of the EU’s political system. Indeed, rather than creating new opportunities for party political competition, the cooperation between centreright and centre-left in the election of the Commission President and subsequent decision-making further strengthened the long-standing ‘grand coalition’ in the European Parliament...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} {{transparency of}} the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, the European Commission has reformed existing information sharing systems for trade policy. The Commission {{has moved from}} a strategy of providing transparency {{in the form of}} access to documents to one of access to information, geared specifically towards enhancing consumption of the available information. In both public and institutional transparency policy, the width of the target audience and the depth of the information have increased, and the manner of provision has shifted from reactive to proactive provision of information. As a result, the TTIP is now being coined as the most transparent trade negotiation ever in the EU’s history and a pilot project for transparency policy in future trade negotiations. The article adopts a supply-centered perspective to explain such a proactive transparency policy that goes beyond the legal minimum imposed by formal requirements. It relies on interview data on the changes brought about in <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations</b> since 2014, basic quantitative and qualitative analysis of document material, and a five-month participatory observation by the author in the secretariat of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{comitology}} – {{the system of}} implementation committees that control the Commission in the execution of delegated powers – has been characterised by institutional tensions. The crux of these tensions has often been {{the role of the}} European Parliament and its quest to be granted powers equal to those of the Council. Over time this tension has been resolved through a series of inter-institutional agreements and Comitology Decisions, essentially giving the Parliament incremental increases in power. This process came to a head with the 2006 Comitology reform and the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS). After just over three years of experience with the RPS procedure, and having revised the entire acquis communautaire, the Treaty of Lisbon made has made it redundant through the creation of Delegated Acts (Article 290 TFEU), which gives the Parliament equal rights of oversight. This article aims to evaluate the practical implications that Delegated Acts will entail for the Parliament, principally by using the four years of experience with the RPS to better understand the challenges ahead. This analysis will be of interest to those following the study of comitology, formal and informal <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations,</b> and also to practitioners who will have to work with Delegated Acts in the future.

40|$|This {{study has}} been drawn up on {{the request of the}} European Parliament, Historical Archives Unit of the Directorate for the Library, Directorate General for Parliamentary Research Services (DG EPRS). The European cast iron ingot, marked “Europ”, was created on 30 April, 1953 at the Belval factory in Esch-sur-Alzette in Luxembourg. Made with {{materials}} from countries that had long been enemies but that had now decided to share their resources, it was the symbol of the construction of Europe introduced on 9 May, 1950 by the Schuman Declaration and inspired by Jean Monnet. Offered to Monnet, who was then president of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), it is held at the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe. This study, the first part of a wider analysis on the European Parliament's role in EU budgetary powers, traces the very first phase of <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations</b> in the framework of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). After a brief historical introduction, the study explains the structure, objectives and means of action of the ECSC. The ECSC Treaty had a number of original features. Among these was the establishment of a High Authority, an independent supranational executive with extensive powers including the capacity to raise funds via a tax (levy) on coal and steel production, to borrow on the capital markets, and to make loans to enterprises. The Treaty also defined the respective roles of the ECSC’s Council of Ministers, Common Assembly and Court of Justice. The ECSC Treaty did not foresee a budgetary procedure: all competences were concentrated in the High Authority, which presented an annual report on its activities to the Assembly. The High Authority was the motor for managing the production of coal and steel, which belonged to the ECSC and not to its member states, and for supporting the modernisation of the industry and of the social conditions of the workers. The present research will highlight a narrative differing in part from the theory of the rules of the ECSC Treaty, and we will discover numerous features which, in spite of the 60 -year gap, point up certain similarities with approaches and problems existing today. The autonomy of the High Authority was mitigated by constant consultation/prior agreement with the Council of Ministers. The Assembly gained influence over the years, in some case obliging the High Authority to modify decisions already taken, even without a specific role being defined in the Treaty. The High Authority introduced multiannual budgetary planning, which was more efficient than annual budgets, and exceptionally allowed a rebate on the levy for two countries. During the 1980 s, the member states increased their influence over the ECSC budget (with a direct contribution based on a mechanism similar to GNI). The High Authority, in view of the cost of production in some countries, decided to introduce a rebate on the levy. It was critical of the way the Assembly’s plenary was organised. The study concludes with an overview of the evolution of <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations,</b> with a focus on the budgetary domain and on the capacity of the institutions to adapt and evolve...|$|E
40|$|Inward {{investment}} {{promotion and}} aftercare remain central aspects of local economic development for English Regional Development Agencies, Scottish and Welsh development bodies, {{and local authorities}} in Britain. In many cases, partnership and consultation mechanisms have become integral to attracting inward investment and providing aftercare. Inward investment is thus an important area in which to explore <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations</b> between agents operating along diverse spatial boundaries and with different responsibilities. In this paper we analyse the local and regional institutional structures and relations characterising the inward investment process in Britain using new survey data from local authorities, regional bodies, and inward investors. We find that promotional activities have clearly defined structures which are chiefly led by the regional level. Aftercare is characterised by more collaborative arrangements involving both regional bodies and local government. However, many bodies are little used, with competition and tension between partners remaining frequent within English regions, regardless of recent institutional changes designed to reduce such problems. In Scotland and Wales, however, their national institutions are not only widely used, but they create high levels of satisfaction from firms. Hence, England has yet {{to respond to the}} effective challenges of Scotland and Wales. The analysis also highlights the limited importance of all national, regional, and local public institutions in attracting inward investors and their subsequent aftercare. The critical inputs to business decisions appear to be driven chiefly by more general supply-side conditions (for example, general skills versus local public packages) and the general attractions of a particular location. ...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. The {{boundaries}} between diplomacy and economic policy are being redefined {{as a result}} of the growing interdependency in the international political economy. Those boundaries have also been altered by the recent encompassing swing to democracy in regions affected by internal and external economic crises. Policy elites are attempting to coordinate macroeconomic and foreign policy within and between regions and subregions, as a way of enhancing their capabilities for carrying out economic and political restructuring. The search for greater policy effectiveness and stronger democracies has rendered necessary to introduce institutional reforms in decision making structures, at the national as well as at the supranational level. In spite of recent developments, the institutional frameworks for international cooperation are still quite tentative. At a normative level, the incipient attention to principles of international distributive justice may be taken as an indication. Some think that to the extent that citizens of rich countries have obligations towards the welfare of people in other countries, a new basis for international morality appears to be necessary. "The state-centered image of the world has lost its normative relevance because of the rise of global economic interdependence" (Beitz 1988 : 48). How can basic rights in all countries be institutionalized and protected? Some argue for the desirability of a constitutional world democracy and an elected world government (Nielsen 1988 : 270 - 271). But experience shows that attempts to institute almost any form of supranational authority have confronted the unwillingness of national actors to subordinate their particular interests to collective goals. The European and the Latin American experiences indicate that the speed at which integration schemes have progressed [...] and their scope [...] have been seriously constrained by the resistance to transfer sovereign powers away from the domestic spheres of decision making. The conviction that flaws in the progress towards regional unity were in part due to the architecture of integration has recently led to treaty amendments, adjustments in <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>relations</b> and a series of other institutional innovations...|$|E
