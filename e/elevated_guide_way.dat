40|$|Automated {{transportation}} is an innovative and sustainable concept that works emission-free with fully-automated and driverless vehicles {{on a network}} of specially-built, <b>elevated</b> <b>guide</b> <b>ways.</b> These systems are also called Automated People Mover (APM) or Public Rapid Transit (PRT) and {{are considered to be}} a solution to many global and environmental problems related {{to the use of the}} automobile. These transportation systems claim to be clean, affordable and safe technology, and a smart urban planning solution to move away from America’s dependence on foreign oil, the faltering auto industry, and the misuse of urban landscapes. One of the first APM systems has been operating since the 1970 ’s at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. In order to examine community’s attitude, perception and individual characteristic that influence the use of the systems, a random intercept survey was conducted. Findings from correlation analysis and an ordered probit model suggest socio-demographic attributes associated with attitudes toward the system. The frequent users are characterized as having a higher level of educational attainment, and are primarily students. Findings explore underlying factors regarding commuting, crucial for transportation policies and practices for managing sustainable transportation systems in comparable urban settings...|$|R
40|$|The Spidernet concept {{consists}} {{in making a}} metropolitan, heavy rail station the hub of a web of <b>elevated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>ways</b> dedicated to small-size cabins driven automatically. Thus, comfortable point-to-point transport service would be provided to passengers, offering both speed and reliability (since its running would be uninterrupted), together with quick access and short wait at egress station were there sufficiently many " podcars ". This specific concept of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) is purported to empower the local attraction of the heavy network and to develop the hub potential as service centre and urban centre. The paper investigates these issues {{in the case of}} the St Denis station in the Grand Paris Express network by the time horizon of implementation. After introducing the territorial context and putting forward a tentative scheme of Spidernet dedicated ways and stations, we turn to simulation to study potential demand, multimodal effects, fare sensitivity and potential revenues, as well as capital and operational costs. Two models are used complementarily: first, a macroscopic, four-step Travel Demand Model at the regional level; then, PRTSim is used for microscopic traffic simulation of both passengers and podcars. Microsimulation is essential to infer realistic enough traffic conditions on the supply side (way capacity, fleet size) as well as on the demand side (effective quality of service, wait time at access station, opportunity of car-sharing). The tentative estimation of revenues and costs suggests that financial profitability might be achieved. Yet a number of important topics still deserve further investigation...|$|R
50|$|The Four {{corridors}} {{have been}} identified based on a feasibility study prepared by the Pallavan Transport Consultancy Services Ltd. A crisscrossing network of monorail corridors, running to a total length of 111 km with four corridors, is being planned by the State government and plans to complete {{the first phase of}} the monorail project within two years. The network includes a 54-km link between Vandalur and Puzhal, which when completed would be the longest anywhere in the world. The developer will be responsible to (DBFOT) design, construct, finance, own, maintain and transfer the project after a period of 30 years. Monorail stations would be aesthetically designed, with minimal use of concrete. Initially, a four-car monorail train is expected to run along an <b>elevated</b> narrow <b>guide</b> <b>way</b> that would come up on the road median. The capacity of one train would be about 560 passengers, which translates to a capacity of about 10,000 passengers per hour per direction.|$|R

High pressure gas molecules have been collided with the supporting surface and the internal surface of the throttle during the flow process. Variable impulse of the surfaces aside for the gas film are affected by the changes of impulse which formed irregular impact force in horizontal and vertical direction. Micro-vibration takes place based on the natural frequency of the system and its frequency doubling. In this paper, the vibration model was established to describe the dynamic characteristics of the gas film, and the formation mechanism of micro vibration in the film is defined. Through the simulation analysis and experimental comparison, formation mechanism of the micro vibration in the gas film is confirmed. It was proposed that the micro vibration of gas film can be produced no matter whether there is a gas chamber or not in the throttle. Under the same conditions, the micro vibration of the <b>guide</b> <b>way</b> with air chamber is greater than that without any chamber.
