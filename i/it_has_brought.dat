25|$|Even {{before its}} dedication, Shasta Dam served an {{important}} role in World War II, providing electricity to California factories, and it still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> about major changes to the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River, and met with controversy over its significant destruction of Native American tribal lands. In recent years, there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and hydropower generation.|$|E

Double R Racing's lead driver, Mike Conway, dominated the championship. In the 2007 British F3 season, Mercedes now powers the majority of the Championship field.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s the {{so-called}} modern synthesis connected natural selection and population genetics, based on Mendelian inheritance, into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations, through fossil transitions in palaeontology, and complex cellular mechanisms in developmental biology. The {{publication of the}} structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance. Molecular biology improved our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Advancements were also made in phylogenetic systematics, mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of evolutionary trees. In 1973, evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky penned that [...] "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution," [...] because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent explanatory body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet.|$|E

500|$|Darryl is {{initially}} unsuccessful in {{his attempts to}} win Charlie over, but Anderson hinted that her character would fall for him. She said, [...] "I think the way Steve [...] has played Brax, there is definitely enough there for Charlie {{to see that he}} has a heart and to see the good side in him as well." [...] Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, [...] "I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head." [...] Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's [...] "safe police world" [...] upside down, and Anderson told him, [...] "What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "fun and flirty" [...] and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{question}} of Being is {{to have its own}} history made transparent, then this hardened tradition must be loosened up, and the concealments which <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> about dissolved.

2500|$|Turkey is {{restructuring}} {{its economy}} {{in an attempt}} to gain full European Union membership. [...] It began this policy in the early 1970s, abandoning its previous import substitution industrialization policy.

[...] Additionally, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline has brought revenue to Turkey and enabled it to share some of the regional hydrocarbon wealth. [...] Turkey's economy is currently led by its automobile, agricultural and textile sectors. [...] It has a per capita GDP of $11,200, supplemented by some 1.2 million Turks working abroad.|$|E
2500|$|As {{modernisation}} has increased, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> {{along with}} it an increase in secularism. In urban areas, the switch to more western dress such as miniskirts and jeans is of concern to religious authorities. Nightclubs and bars thrive in the cities. However, in the time since independence other areas have become more islamicised. At the time of independence women wore tight-fitting outfits, but now wear headscarves. Muslim prayers are played through the speaker systems of government buildings, and some feel Malaysia is becoming a more Islamic than secular state, with critics complaining that Islam is gaining greater influence in governance. [...] The issue of how the Malay identity should be developed has increasingly come under debate. While the ruling government believes that attaining economic power will empower the Malay population, PAS sees that as an erosion of Islamic values. However, PAS is often seen as to {{not be able to}} relate Islamic beliefs to modern society, especially in multicultural Malaysia.|$|E

For, that the monument (the cross) of his (Christ) most holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants now set free through the removal of him who was the common enemy of all, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration. I have no greater care than how I may best adorn with a splendid structure that sacred spot, which, under Divine direction, I have disencumbered as it were of the heavy weight of foul idol worship;(Roman temple of Venus) a spot which has been accounted holy from the beginning in God’s judgment, but which now appears holier still, since <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> to light a clear assurance of our Saviour’s passion.
