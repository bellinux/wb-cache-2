40|$|A model {{water turbine}} draft tube {{containing}} vortex generators (VG) was studied. Numerical simulations {{were performed to}} investigate 55 design variations of the vortex generators in a draft tube. After analyzing the shapes of streamlines and velocity distributions in the tube and comparing static pressure recovery coefficients (SPRC) in different design variations, an optimum vortex generator layout, which can raise SPRC of the draft tube by 4. 8 percent, was found. To verify {{the effectiveness of the}} vortex generator application, a series of experiments were carried out. The results show that by choosing optimal vortex generator parameters, such as the <b>installation</b> <b>type,</b> <b>installation</b> position, blade-to-blade distance, and blade inclination angle, the draft tube equipped vortex generators can effectively raise their SPRC andworking stability...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} {{responded with}} the PV Act (2010) which entered into force retrospectively {{with effect from}} 1July 2010. The legislation introduced a dramatic reduction in photovoltaic tariffs, cutting these between 8 and 13% depending on the <b>installation</b> <b>type,</b> followed by a second cut of 3%. The deployment corridor was doubled to between 2500 and 3500MWp, along with tighter growth-dependant degression rates of 1-12%, {{in addition to the}} ordinary degression of 9%. The self-consumption incentive was significantly raised to around 8¢/kWh and eligibility extended to systems up to 500kWp. The feed-in rate itself was dependent on the system size and the proportion of demand that was consumed on-site. Free-standing systems were excluded from using agricultural land.|$|R

40|$|Design {{requirements}} for photovoltaic modules and arrays used in {{commercial and industrial}} applications were identified. Building codes and referenced standards were reviewed for their applicability to commercial and industrial photovoltaic array installation. Four general <b>installation</b> <b>types</b> were identified - integral (replaces roofing), direct (mounted on top of roofing), stand-off (mounted away from roofing), and rack (for flat or low slope roofs, or ground mounted). Each of the generic mounting types {{can be used in}} vertical wall mounting systems. This implies eight mounting types exist in the commercial/industrial sector. Installation costs were developed for these mounting types as a function of panel/module size. Cost drivers were identified.

40|$|To {{guarantee}} a good productivity {{and a better}} quality of the industrial systems, it is necessary to know the evolution of its various parameters but also its operation mode. The main goal of this work is to carry out a study to improve a flatness control in a reversing cold rolling mill, precisely the web winding system part. We designate by a winding process any system applying the cycles of unwinding, transport, treatment and winding to various flat products. This system knows several constraints such as the thermal effects caused by the frictions, and the mechanical effects provoked by metal elongation, that generates dysfunctions due to the influence of the process conditions. For this <b>installations</b> <b>type,</b> the various automatisms functions, often very advanced, are realized in modular systems with distributed architecture. Our main goal is to obtain a precise thickness, with the best possible regularity.

40|$|This project {{provides}} {{educational opportunities}} creating both a teaching facility and center for public outreach. The facility {{is the largest}} solar array in Nebraska. It was designed to allow students to experience a variety of technologies and provide the public with opportunities for exposure {{to the implementation of}} an alternative energy installation designed for an urban setting. The project integrates products from 5 panel manufacturers (including monocrystalline, polycrystalline and thin film technologies) mounted on both fixed and tracking structures. The facility uses both micro and high power inverters. The majority of the system was constructed to serve as an outdoor classroom where panels can be monitored, tested, removed and replaced by students. As an educational facility it primarily serves students in the Creighton University and Metropolitan Community College, but it also provides broader educational opportunities. The project includes a real-time âdashboardâ and a historical database of the output of individual inverters and the corresponding meteorological data for researcher and student use. This allows the evaluation of both panel types and the feasibility of <b>installation</b> <b>types</b> in a region of the country subject to significant temperature, wind and precipitation variation...|$|R

3000|$|Due to the {{existence}} of the coating layer {{on the surface of the}} fiber Bragg grating sensor, there is about a 0.15 mm gap between the machine tool surface and the fiber Bragg grating temperature sensing point. In the temperature gradient of − 46.4 °C/mm, the small space is sufficient to produce a large temperature test error. By using thermal conductive paste, the uniformity of the surface temperature can be improved, and the error of the surface temperature measurement by FBG can be significantly reduced compared to that from a commercial thermal resistance surface temperature sensor. Ref. [96] studied influence of the <b>installation</b> <b>types</b> on surface temperature measurement by a FBG sensor. The surface temperature measurement error of the FBG sensor with single-ended fixation, double-ended fixation and fully-adhered fixation are theoretical analyzed and experimental studied. The single-ended fixation results in a positive linear error with increasing surface temperature, while the double-ended fixation and fully-adhered fixation both result in non-linear error with increasing surface temperature that are affected by thermal expansion strain of the tested surface’s material. Due to its linear error and strain-resistant characteristics, the single-ended fixation will play an important role in the FBG surface temperature sensor encapsulation design field [...].|$|R
