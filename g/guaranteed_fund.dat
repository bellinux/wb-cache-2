However, one substantial value of the guaranteed annuity rates was to create a floor pension (the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> multiplied by the guaranteed annuity rate) for the GARs which those policies without GARs (non-GARs) did not have. In the case, for example, of market annuity rates at age 65 being 7.1% p.a. - not untypical of market annuity rates the time of the Hyman judgement (as opposed to a guaranteed annuity rate at 65 of 11.72% p.a. as stated in the GAR policy document) - a typical <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> might have been £80,000 and a typical terminal bonus might have been £5,000 (thus total pension fund of £85,000=80,000+5,000).|$|E
50|$|In 1998, {{because the}} GAR policyholders {{received}} a lower terminal bonus than they expected (they expected the higher terminal bonus and, in addition, the GAR rate) certain GAR policyholders complained. Mr Hyman was a representative policyholder. At no point, however, were the GAR policyholders ever paid less per annum (and {{nor was there}} ever any intention by the directors of Equitable Life to pay them less) than their <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> (i.e. excluding the non-contractual terminal bonus) times guaranteed annuity rate.|$|E

5000|$|A stable value fund {{is a type}} of {{investment}} available in 401(k) plans and other defined contribution plans as well as some 529 or tuition assistance plans. [...] Stable value funds are often made available in these plans under a name that intends to describe the nature of the fund (such as capital preservation fund, fixed-interest fund, capital accumulation fund, principal protection fund, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund,</b> preservation fund, or income fund among others). [...] They offer principal preservation, predictable returns, and a rate higher than similar options without proportionately increasing risk. [...] The funds are structured in various ways, but in general they are composed of high quality, diversified fixed income portfolios that are protected against interest rate volatility by contracts from banks and insurance companies. For example, a stable value fund may hold highly rated government or corporate debt, asset-backed securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and cash equivalents. [...] Stable value funds are designed to preserve principal while providing steady, positive returns, and are considered one of the lowest risk investment options offered in 401(k) plans. [...] Stable value funds have recently been returning an annualized average of 2.72% as of October 2014, higher than the 0.08% offered by money-market funds, and are offered in 165,000 retirement plans.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of hedging discrete stochastic jumps and their tradeoffs in guaranteed funds under discrete dynamic hedging. Since a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> price process is composed of diffusion and jump process, its expected rate of return is above the risk-free rate of interest. When delta dynamic hedging occurs at discrete instants, the rate differential will be manifested in non-zero expected hedging errors. We employ the dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> as our example, whose exotic fund structure excludes {{the possibility of}} static hedge. We derive a pricing model and develop hedging formulas for discrete dynamic guaranteed funds. We show our discrete-time delta hedging formulas induce smaller hedging errors than those based on applying the continuous-time hedging formula of Gerber and Pafumi (2000) at discrete instants. Nevertheless, this discrete-time model still incurs significant negative expected hedging errors induced partly by the guarantee jumps. We introduce a gamma-adjusted delta hedging strategy. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} strategy can effectively improve the discrete hedging performance of dynamic guaranteed funds. ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> was {{established}} in 1994 to enable communities of slum dwellers to access loans from banks. Given the perceived high risk of lending to slum dwellers, few banks in developing countries are willing to lend to such organisations. The <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> was created to offer guarantees to bank so as to lower their perceived risk. The main contributors to the Fund have been UK Housing Associations through long-term deposits. The <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> has been used chiefly in India and Bolivia.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{characterize}} two institutions belonging to the financial safety net, which serves as stabilizer to the financial system: to the Bank <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> and to the Insurance <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund.</b> The elaboration consists of three parts. In the first one there is the financial safety net defined, the next part presents essence of actions of the Bank <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> and the last part shows the Insurance <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund.</b> There are both similarities and differences among these funds, related to the scope of subject and object as well as the characteristics of action. Analysis of the functioning UFG and BFG shows that their diversed activities are needed to strengthen the protection of customers of both banking and insurance sector, particularly during the crisis in the economy. Organizational and financial effort bore in order to create mechanisms (such as <b>guarantee</b> <b>funds)</b> protecting clients potentially produces benefits. However, you must be aware that past actions are insufficient and there is still a need for further development...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUnlike {{traditional}} valuation methods, viability theory provides {{tools for}} eradicating the risk, by determining the minimum initial capital that {{would meet the}} commitments of the investor, regardless market developments. In this study, we compare two approaches to risk assessment within a framework of asset-liability management (ALM) of a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund.</b> The optimal allocation of assets for such funds is determined initially by the classical portfolio insurance (thus with a statistical evaluation of risk) {{and then in a}} second step, by tools of viability theory. Although the results from the two approaches are not strictly comparable in terms of numerical point of view (as in both cases the goals are different in nature), this study offers, on a practical example of ALM management, two radically different philosophies: one is the statistical evaluation of risk, based on probabilistic models, while the other one eradicates risk, using viability theory...|$|E
40|$|Guaranteed {{funds with}} {{crediting}} rates for fixed periods {{determined by a}} Pension Provider or Insurance Company are common features of accumulation annuity contracts. Policyholders can transfer money {{back and forth between}} these accounts and Money Market accounts which give them features similar to demand deposits and yet they frequently credit a higher rate than the Money Market. Transfer restrictions are commonly employed to prevent arbitrage. In this paper, we model the interaction between company and policyholder as a multiperiod game in which the company maximizes risk-neutral expected present value of profits and the policyholder maximizes his expected discounted utility. We find that the optimal strategy {{on the part of the}} company is to credit a rate higher than money market rate in the first period to entice the policyholder to invest in the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund.</b> The company then credits the floor in the remaining periods as the policyholder transfers out the maximum amount. This does better for the policyholder in low interest rate environments and worse in high interest rate environments and acts as a type of “interest rate insurance” for the policyholder...|$|E
