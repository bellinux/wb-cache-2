40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the <b>hiring</b> {{process of}} Dutch firms using individual data on filled vacancies. If {{more than one}} employee is <b>hired,</b> firms may choose between <b>hiring</b> all employees at once (instantaneous <b>hiring)</b> or <b>hiring</b> its employees {{over a longer period}} of time (gradual <b>hiring).</b> We find that about 56 percent of the employees are <b>hired</b> at once. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of an increase in labour market tightness (excess labour demand) on the costs and structure of <b>hiring.</b> Our estimates show that a tightening of the labour market 1) raises the costs of hiring; 2) prolongs the period of gradual hiring; 3) leads to a smaller probability of <b>hiring</b> all employees at once...|$|R

40|$|Firms select {{not only}} how many, but also which workers to <b>hire.</b> Yet, in {{standard}} search models of the labor market, all workers have the same probability of being <b>hired.</b> We argue that selective <b>hiring</b> crucially a¤ects welfare analysis. Our model is isomorphic to a search model under random <b>hiring</b> but allows for selective <b>hiring.</b> With selective <b>hiring,</b> the positive predictions of the model change very little, but the welfare costs of unemployment are much larger because unemployment risk is distributed unequally across workers. As a result, optimal unemployment insurance may be higher and welfare is lower if <b>hiring</b> is selective...|$|R
