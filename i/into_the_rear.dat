40|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) to <b>rearing</b> systems in <b>the</b> Mediterranean by fattening or experimental paralarval production, emergence of diseases has become a concern. The most devastating infection of reared octopus stock is the coccidian parasite Aggregata sp. (Apicomplexa: Aggregatidae) that causes weight loss, excitation and behavioral changes, and miliar subcutaneous parasitic cysts. During eight months of experimental fattening of common octopus in the aquaculture facilities of the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries (Split, Croatia), 7 % mortality was attributed to infection by Aggregata sp. Although the detailed life cycle of the genus Aggregata is not yet completely elucidated, it is known that this heteroxenous coccidian uses crustaceans for merogony, which comprise 30 % of the cephalopod’s diet. For the moment, only adequate zooprophylactic measures can prevent the emergence of the infection in <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system. Preventing introduction of adult specimens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system is a critical zooprophylactic measure, along with stocking only juvenile cephalopods that are uninfected by the coccidian through the food web in the natural environment and are, thus, unable to introduce <b>the</b> infection <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system. <b>The</b> second measure involves avoiding crustaceans in <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> diet...|$|R

5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{during the}} tadpole stage, {{one of the}} {{developing}} rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.|$|E
40|$|Aims: In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} N-acyl homoserine lactone-degrading bacterial enrichment cultures (ECs) on larviculture of the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Methods and Results: The larval performance in terms of larval growth, larval survival, larval quality, duration of <b>the</b> larval <b>rearing</b> process and microflora levels in <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water as well as inside the prawn gut was investigated. The application of the EC bacteria was performed in two ways: by adding them directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> larval <b>rearing</b> water and via enriched Artemia nauplii used for larval feeding. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated that both ECs that were tested had a similar positive effect on larval survival and larval quality, whereas they did not affect larval growth or the duration of <b>the</b> larval <b>rearing</b> process. Conclusions: Under normal hatchery conditions, the optimal EC densities were found to be 106 CFU ml- 1 for adding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water and 5 x 108 CFU ml- 1 for enrichment of Artemia nauplii used for feeding of the larvae. In the hatchery, the ECs can be grown on waste streams of Artemia hatching. Significance and Impact of the Study: Application of this kind of ECs could lead to a more sustainable aquaculture production, by replacing the use of antibiotics to control diseases...|$|R

5|$|Twin {{depth charge}} tunnels were built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> {{hull of the}} Mogador-class ships. Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges, with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine. They were {{launched}} by remote control in patterns of four using a chain system. Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges were unlikely to actually damage a submarine.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> wall, on the forts southern side. This room is {{set into the}} end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns {{and began to}} pour cannon fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns {{and this time it}} was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E

5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked. With the Parliamentarian musketeers firing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of Langdale's force, the Royalists broke, some {{escaping}} via Holt Bridge and others running towards Chester. On Hoole Heath these retreating soldiers met {{with part of}} Gerard's force and made an initially successful counter-attack before being forced back to the walls of Chester. There the retreating cavalry choked up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into the confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a comfortable lead {{over the rest of}} the field. When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E

Blücher intended to secure his right upon the Châteaux Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road. Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack. General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.|$|E
