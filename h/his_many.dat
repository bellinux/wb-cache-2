5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With <b>his</b> <b>many</b> writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige.

This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's early {{romantic and}} sexual {{relationships}} were exclusively with men.

Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated <b>his</b> <b>many</b> sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E

5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as <b>his</b> <b>many</b> satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's first {{fifteen years}} of service in Mantua are {{bracketed}} by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and {{the fourth and fifth}} books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; <b>his</b> <b>many</b> duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.|$|E
