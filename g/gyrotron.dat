50|$|The <b>gyrotron</b> {{is a type}} of free-electron maser which generates {{high-frequency}} {{electromagnetic radiation}} by stimulated cyclotron resonance of electrons moving through a strong magnetic field.

This is unlike conventional microwave vacuum tubes such as klystrons and magnetrons, in which the wavelength is determined by a single-mode resonant cavity, a slow-wave structure, and thus as operating frequencies increase, the resonant cavity structures must decrease in size, which limits their power-handling capability.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>gyrotron</b> a hot {{filament}} in an electron gun {{at one end}} of the tube emits an annular-shaped (hollow tubular) beam of electrons, which is accelerated by a high-voltage anode and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial magnetic field, usually created by a superconducting magnet around the tube. The field causes the electrons to move helically in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through the tube. At the position in the tube where the magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) at their cyclotron resonance frequency. The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in the tube, which acts as an open-ended resonant cavity, and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of the tube into a waveguide. The spent electron beam is absorbed by a collector electrode at the end of the tube.|$|E
5000|$|As {{in other}} linear-beam {{microwave}} tubes, {{the energy of}} the output electromagnetic waves comes from the kinetic energy of the electron beam, which is due to the accelerating anode voltage. In the region before the resonant cavity where the magnetic field strength is increasing, it compresses the electron beam, converting the longitudinal drift velocity to transverse orbital velocity, in a process similar to that occurring in a magnetic mirror used in plasma confinement. [...] The orbital velocity of the electrons is 1.5 to 2 times their axial beam velocity. Due to the standing waves in the resonant cavity, the electrons become [...] "bunched"; that is, their phase becomes coherent (synchronized) so they are all at the same point in their orbit at the same time. Therefore, they emit coherent radiation. [...] The electron speed in a <b>gyrotron</b> is slightly relativistic (comparable to but not close to the speed of light). This contrasts to the free-electron laser (and xaser) that work on different principles and whose electrons are highly relativistic.|$|E
