50|$|The <b>Fire</b> <b>Plug</b> Stakes is an American Thoroughbred {{horse race}} held in January at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. It {{is open to}} horses four-year-olds and up and is run at six furlongs on the dirt.|$|R
50|$|An {{ungraded}} stakes, {{it offers}} a purse of $125,000. The race was {{named in honor of}} <b>Fire</b> <b>Plug,</b> a quick and durable horse that ran throughout the east coast from age three to age seven. He was campaigned by his breeder and owner, Arthur Appleton, and trained by Bob Camac. The gelding won or placed in 50 of his 54 lifetime starts, most of those races being sprints. Half of his 29 victories came in graded stakes races, including the J. Edgar Hoover Stakes, the Maryland Breeders' Cup Handicap and the Roman Handicap. The son of King of the North, <b>Fire</b> <b>Plug</b> retired in 1991 at the age of 8 after placing in three stakes that season and winning the final start of his career.|$|R

50|$|In 1811 Graff {{recommended}} Fairmount as {{the proper}} {{place for the}} water works, and was entrusted with their construction. At this time, the pipes were made of wood, but Graff devised an iron-pipe system to be used instead. He brought the work to perfection, and patterns of his <b>fire</b> <b>plugs</b> and stopcocks were sent to England. In 1822, when the basic system was complete, the city water committee sent him a resolution of thanks, and he was presented with a silver vase. His experience and ability became acknowledged throughout the country, and he supplied detailed information to about 37 corporations in the United States, including New York City and Boston.|$|R
60|$|He {{never before}} {{had been in the}} country districts of his native land. To him the United States was all like Chicago or New York or Milwaukee, the three cities with which he was most familiar. His {{experience}} of unurban localities had been gained amidst the primeval jungles of far-away Yoka. There had been no detective sergeants there--unquestionably there could be none here. Detective sergeants were indigenous to the soil that grew corner saloons and poolrooms, and to none other--as well expect to discover one of Oda Yorimoto's samurai hiding behind a <b>fire</b> <b>plug</b> on Michigan Boulevard, as to look for one of those others along a farm-bordered road.|$|R
50|$|Magneto {{ignition}} {{was introduced}} on the 1899 Daimler Phönix. This {{was followed by}} Benz, Mors, Turcat-Mery, and Nesseldorf, and soon was used on most cars up until about 1918 in both low voltage (voltage for secondary coils to <b>fire</b> the spark <b>plugs)</b> and high voltage magnetos (to <b>fire</b> the spark <b>plug</b> directly, similar to coil ignitions, introduced by Bosch in 1903).|$|R

50|$|Later Otto engines {{employed}} a small magneto {{directly on the}} engine. Rather than tripping a switch, the spark <b>plug</b> <b>firing</b> arm applies a quick rotation to the magneto rotor, which then snaps back under spring tension. This quick rotation of the magneto coil produces a very brief current flow that <b>fires</b> the spark <b>plug</b> and ignites the fuel. This design {{has the advantage of}} requiring no external battery, and is how modern portable gas engines operate, incorporating the magnet portion of the magneto into the flywheel. Modern portable engines excite the magneto with every flywheel rotation, and so use a cam-operated electric switch to prevent <b>plug</b> <b>firing</b> except for the power stroke of the engine (see wasted spark).|$|R

50|$|The 16 Valve engine {{features}} individual 'coil over plug' ignition where {{the timing of}} the ignition is controlled directly by the Bosch engine management system, with each coil <b>firing</b> two spark <b>plugs</b> simultaneously. On the earlier CF1 and CF2 16 valve engines each coil <b>fired</b> the <b>plug</b> below it and (via a short plug lead) a plug in the other cylinder that was 360° crankshaft rotation out of phase (i.e. one coil would <b>fire</b> a spark <b>plug</b> in the cylinder nearing the top of the compression stroke, and also the a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the top of the exhaust stroke (in a 4-cylinder 4-stroke engine with a 180° crank pistons 1 & 4 and pistons 2 & 3 rise and fall as pairs). So in this configuration each coil services two spark plugs and each cylinder is serviced by two coils. In case of a coil failure one of two plugs would still work.|$|R
50|$|For safety reasons, JROTC M1903s {{are made}} {{permanently}} unable to <b>fire</b> by <b>plugging</b> the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the ON position. To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod is inserted; after it warms up {{it is too}} tight to remove.|$|R
50|$|Ignition coil - an {{induction}} coil used in internal combustion engines {{to create a}} pulse of high voltage to <b>fire</b> the spark <b>plug</b> which initiates the fuel burning.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the multi-cylinder systems {{noted above}} (which <b>fire</b> two <b>plugs</b> {{simultaneously}} from a double-ended coil) the coil {{in this system}} has only a single HT lead running to the single plug. The flywheel magneto provides other services in, for instance, small motorcycles, as it can easily be built to provide direct-current battery-charging power at almost no additional cost or weight.|$|R
50|$|To the north, {{just behind}} the house, stands a small wooden {{garrison}} structure measuring about 15 x 15 ft. It is built out of hand-hewn timbers, and stands on its original foundation, despite having been relocated for some years to a site in Kittery Point. The wood is pine and oak, {{the ends of the}} beams are dovetailed together, with additional framing members that lock the structure together. Some of the beams have portholes through which defenders could <b>fire,</b> <b>plugged</b> with what are believed to be the original wooden plugs. Beyond this building stands a larger two-story garrison structure, also built out of massive hand-hewn timbers measuring as much as 18 x 8 in in cross-section. This structure's portholes exhibit evidence of military action, including holes likely gouged by arrows and musket balls. The upper floor is accessed via stairs that can be retracted, and has trapdoors through which defenders can fire into the ground floor in the event attackers gain access to it.|$|R
5000|$|An {{electric}} fireplace is {{an electric}} heater that mimics a fireplace burning coal, wood, or natural gas. Electric fireplaces are often placed in conventional fireplaces, which can then {{no longer be}} used for conventional <b>fires.</b> They <b>plug</b> into the wall, and can run on a [...] "flame only" [...] setting, or {{can be used as}} a heater, typically consuming 1.4-1.6 kW, that can heat a 400 sq ft room.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of modern semiconductor electronics {{it was not uncommon}} for devices, typically television receivers, to catch <b>fire</b> when <b>plugged</b> in but switched off, sometimes when fully switched off rather than on standby. This is much less likely with modern equipment, but not impossible. Older cathode-ray tube display equipment (television and computer displays) had high voltages and currents, and were far more of a fire risk than thin panel LCD and other displays.|$|R

50|$|Spark plugs {{may also}} be used for other purposes; in Saab Direct Ignition when they are not <b>firing,</b> spark <b>plugs</b> are used to measure {{ionization}} in the cylinders - this ionic current measurement is used to replace the ordinary cam phase sensor, knock sensor and misfire measurement function. Spark plugs {{may also be}} used in other applications such as furnaces wherein a combustible fuel/air mixture must be ignited. In this case, they are sometimes referred to as flame igniters.|$|R

5000|$|To {{simplify the}} engine and reduce costs, the V-twin {{ignition}} was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This {{is known as a}} dual fire ignition system, causing both spark <b>plugs</b> to <b>fire</b> regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke, with the other spark <b>plug</b> <b>firing</b> on its cylinder's exhaust stroke, effectively [...] "wasting a spark". The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping.The 45° design of the engine thus creates a <b>plug</b> <b>firing</b> sequencing as such: The first cylinder fires, the second (rear) cylinder fires 315° later, then there is a 405° gap until the first cylinder fires again, giving the engine its unique sound.|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{vehicles}} {{are beginning to}} appear on the market, but so far their sensing and warning functions only work on the open road. Functions such as runoff-road warning or adaptive cruise control are designed for the uncluttered environments of open highways. We are working on the much more difficult problem of sensing and driver interfaces for driving in urban areas. We need to sense cars and pedestrians and curbs and <b>fire</b> <b>plugs</b> and bicycles and lamp posts; we need to predict the paths of our own vehicle and of other moving objects; and we need to decide when to issue alerts or warnings to both the driver of our own vehicle and (potentially) to nearby pedestrians. No single sensor is currently able to detect and track all relevant objects. We are working with radar, ladar, stereo vision, and a novel light-stripe range sensor. We have installed a subset of these sensors on a city bus, driving through the streets of Pittsburgh on its normal runs. We are using different kinds of data fusion for different subsets of sensors, plus a coordinating framework for mapping objects at an abstract level...|$|R

50|$|At {{first the}} alibi {{of being in}} Boston was a good one, until {{investigators}} discovered an alarm clock, spark <b>plug,</b> <b>fire</b> screen, clock spring and some hairpins to make a timed arson device. Mr. Small {{was known to be}} a tinkerer who enjoyed mechanical projects.|$|R
50|$|As {{the circuit}} opens each time, the energy {{stored in the}} solenoid's {{magnetic}} field is released and by electromagnetic induction produces a pulse of high voltage in the secondary coil winding. This voltage is sufficient to <b>fire</b> a spark <b>plug</b> located in the engine's cylinder, igniting the petrol mixture.|$|R
50|$|Lead fusible plugs may {{be present}} in the crown of the boiler's firebox. If the water level drops, such that the {{temperature}} of the firebox crown increases significantly, the lead melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the <b>fire.</b> The <b>plugs</b> are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.|$|R
5000|$|The wasted spark {{system is}} an {{ignition}} system {{used in some}} four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines. In a wasted spark system, the spark <b>plugs</b> <b>fire</b> in pairs, with one plug in a cylinder on its compression stroke and the other plug in a cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The extra spark during the exhaust stroke has no effect and is thus [...] "wasted". This design halves the number of components necessary in a typical ignition system, while the extra spark, against much reduced dielectric resistance, barely impacts the lifespan of modern ignition components. In a typical engine, it requires only about 2-3 kV to fire the cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The remaining coil energy is available to <b>fire</b> the spark <b>plug</b> in the cylinder on its compression stroke (typically about 8 to 12 kV).|$|R
50|$|Boxer-twin {{engines are}} {{well suited to}} the wasted spark {{ignition}} system, a distributor-less ignition system using a double-ended coil <b>firing</b> both spark <b>plugs</b> on each revolution, that is, on both the compression stroke and the exhaust stroke.
