40|$|To extract {{functional}} {{information on}} genes and processes from large expression datasets, analysis methods are required that can computationally {{deal with these}} amounts of data, are tunable to specific research questions, and construct classifiers that are not overspecific to the dataset at hand. To satisfy these requirements, a stepwise procedure that combines elements from principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, was developed to specifically retrieve genes involved in processes of interest and classify samples based upon those genes. In a global expression dataset of 300 gene knock-outs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the procedure successfully classified samples with similar 'cellular component' Gene Ontology annotations of the <b>knock-out</b> <b>gene</b> by expression signatures of limited numbers of genes. The genes discriminating 'mitochondrion' from the other subgroups were evaluated in more detail.

In order to further investigate {{the role of the}} immune system in bone metabolism, we studied basic properties of bone physiology in ß 2 -microglobulin-deficient mice created by the technique of gene knock-out. Ten week-old male offspring homozygous (non-functional class I MHC molecule) or heterozygous (functional class I MHC molecule) for ß 2 -microglobulin <b>knock-out</b> <b>gene</b> did not differ in the following measures of bone turnover: femur length, dry and ash weight and calcium content, serum calcium concen-tration and alkaline phosphatase activity, total vertebral tissue area, trabecular bone volume, osteid surface, osteo-clast surface and mineral apposition rate.

40|$|Senses {{together}} with thoughts and experience are key factors that shape our cognition. Touch {{is an important}} source of sensory information. Disturbances {{to the development of the}} somatosensory system have serious consequences for social behaviour and may lead to many neurodevelopmental disorders. In our studies we used three different mouse models of disease. DISC 1 -cc transgenic mouse with transient disruption of the DISC 1 protein signalling was used in the project related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. DISC 1 is a molecule implicated in psychiatric disorders, which was discovered in a large Scottish family whose several members over four generations exhibited schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. In the following projects we focused on the fragile-X-syndrome-related problems. We analysed Fmr 1 KO mouse with a <b>knock-out</b> <b>gene</b> Fmr 1 coding the FMR 1 protein and the BC 1 KO mouse with a knock out gene coding BC 1 non-protein-coding RNA. Fmr 1 KO mouse constitutes the most popular mouse model of fragile X syndrome mimicking many of its phenotypes that occur in humans. In contrast, BC 1 KO mouse was created to study a specific role of this molecule rather than mimic symptoms of the fragile X syndrome. Both the FMR 1 protein and BC 1 non-protein-coding RNA are involved in control of a protein translation process and they are found in similar molecular complexes side by side. In DISC 1 -cc mice we expressed the truncated protein DISC 1 -cc for a controlled period of time at different points during the early postnatal development. Development is shaped by sensory experience, especially during phases known as critical periods. Disruption of experience in the critical period normally produces neurons that lack specificity for sensory experience in adulthood. We found that transient disruption of DISC 1 signalling during a critical period of development produced neurons that lack plasticity in adulthood. Adult plasticity deficits may be associated with cognitive deficits and the delayed onset of psychiatric symptoms in late adolescence. In Fmr 1 KO mice, we focused on analysing somatosensory processing defects that lead to hypersensitivity to touch in fragile X syndrome patients. We showed neuronal mechanisms that appear to underlie hypersensitivity to somatosensory stimuli (whisker deflections) thus causing an altered behaviour observed in Fmr 1 KO mice. In further studies on BC 1 KO mice, we characterized electrophysiological aspects of whisker-stimulation-evoked cortical responses and spontaneous activity of recorded neurons. We used similar recording protocols to the ones optimized by us for previous recordings in Fmr 1 KO mice therefore these experiments might be informative for future studies on specific roles and interactions between the FMR 1 protein and the BC 1 non-protein-coding RNA. Furthermore, our experiments on BC 1 KO mice were a part of a larger project that provides a broader overview of the phenotypes represented in this mouse. To sum up, using the whisker somatosensory circuit as a model system we have obtained insight into potential disease mechanism involving sensory processing that could contribute to human brain disorders...|$|E

Recent progress in gene-editing technology is now allowing neuroscientists unprecedented access to edit the genome efficiently. Although many important tools have been developed, here we focus on approaches that allow for rapid gene-editing in the mature nervous system, particularly CRISPR/Cas 9 and anti-sense nucleotide-based techniques. CRISPR/Cas 9 is a flexible gene-editing tool, allowing the genome to be manipulated in diverse ways. For instance, CRISPR/Cas 9 has been successfully used to <b>knock-out</b> <b>genes,</b> knock-in mutations, overexpress or inhibit gene activity, and provide scaffolding for recruiting specific epigenetic regulators to individual genes and gene regions. Moreover, the CRISPR/Cas 9 system may be modified to target multiple genes at one time, affording simultaneous inhibition and overexpression of distinct genetic targets.

Anti-sense nucleotide-based technologies can be used to rapidly knock down genes in the brain and are simple to use. A main advantage of anti-sense based tools is their independence of viral packaging, allowing for rapid gene delivery with minimal technical expertise.

The zebrafish is an excellent vertebrate model for studying MHB development due to the ease of gene manipulation {{and the possibility of}} following cellular dynamics and morphogenetic processes using live imaging. Currently, only very few reporter and/or Cre-driver lines are available to study gene expression at the MHB, hampering the understanding of MHB development, and traditional transgenic technologies using promoter/enhancer fragments or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) -mediated transgenesis often do not faithfully recapitulate endogenous expression patterns. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated genome editing technology now provides a great opportunity to efficiently knock-in or <b>knock-out</b> <b>genes.</b> We have generated four CRISPR/Cas 9 -based knock-in fluorescent reporter lines for two crucial genes involved in MHB development, namely otx 2 and pax 2 a.

However, time and costs required for the screening of {{a huge number of}} animals, aimed to identify first founder fishes (F 0), and then carriers (F 1) are still a bottleneck. Currently, high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is the most efficient technology for large-scale InDels detection, but the very expensive equipment demanded for its appli-cation may represent a limitation for research laboratories.

The chicken B cell line DT 40 {{has been widely}} used {{as a model for}} <b>gene</b> <b>knock-outs</b> due to its high targeted integration activity. Disruption of multiple genes and complementation of the phenotypes is, however, restricted by the number of available selectable marker genes. It is therefore highly desirable to recycle the selectable markers using a site-specific recombination system like Cre/loxP. Results We constructed three plasmid vectors (neoR, puroR and bsr), which carry selectable marker genes flanked by two different mutant loxP sites. After stable transfection, the marker genes can be excised from the genome by transient induction of Cre recombinase expression. This excision converts the two mutant loxP sites to an inactive double-mutant loxP. Furthermore we constructed a versatile expression vector to clone cDNA expression cassettes between mutant loxP sites. This vector {{can also be used to}} design knock-out constructs in which the floxed marker gene is combined with a cDNA expression cassette. This construct enables <b>gene</b> <b>knock-out</b> and complementation in a single step. Gene expression can subsequently be terminated by the Cre mediated deletion of the cDNA expression cassette. This strategy is powerful for analyzing essential genes, whose disruption brings lethality to the mutant cell. Conclusions Mutant loxP vectors have been developed for the recycle of selectable markers and conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knock-out</b> approaches. As the marker and the cDNA expression cassettes are driven by the universally active and evolutionary conserved β-actin promoter, they can be used for the selection of stable transfectants in a wide range of cell lines. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the in vivo neurotoxicity of the prion fragment P 118 – 135 and to evaluate the potential role of the physiological isoform of PrP in the P 118 – 135 -induced cell death. Here, we demonstrate that the nonfibrillar P 118 – 135 is cytotoxic to retinal neurons in vivo as monitored by intravitreal inoculation and recording of the electrical activity of retina and tissue examination. Moreover, <b>knock-out</b> PrP <b>gene</b> mice exhibit similar sensitivity to the nonfibrillar P 118 – 135 -induced cell death and electrical perturbations, strongly suggesting that cell death occurs independently of PrP expression. Interestingly, a variant nonfusogenic P 118 – 135 peptide (termed P 118 – 135 �) had no effects on in vivo neuronal viability, suggesting that the P 118 – 135 -induced cell death is mediated by its membrane destabilizing properties. These data have further been confirmed in vitro. We show that the fusogenic peptide P 118 – 135 induces death of cultured neurons from both wild-type and <b>knock-out</b> PrP <b>gene</b> mice via an apoptotic-mediated pathway, involving early caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. Altogether these results emphasize the neurotoxicity of the fusogenic nonfibrillar PrP transmembrane domain and indicate that fibril formation and PrP expression are not obligatory requirements for neuronal cell death.

Natural transformation is one of the HGT options and is the state during which bacteria is capable of taking free genetic material from the environment and recombining it in own chromosome. Conventional laboratory method for observation of natural transformation and HGT based on growth selection has substantial limitations, such as underestimation of real transformation frequency, use of antibiotic resistance markers and general laboriousness. Therefore, some attempts to visualize HGT directly have been made with employment of fluorescent proteins and luminescence production as an alternative to conventional markers. This study has made an attempt to create the new system for tracking the natural transformation in the real time with use of luminescence production as a fast measure of transformation extent. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP 1 known for its natural competence and easy handling, full genome sequence of which is available, was chosen as a model organism for these manipulations.

We describe a first experiment of such benchmarking by using <b>gene</b> <b>knock-out</b> data generated from the modeled organisms...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a modified RNA interference (RNAi) method for generating <b>gene</b> <b>knock-outs</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. We used the sequence of the yellow (y) locus to construct an inverted repeat that will form a double-stranded hairpin structure (y‐IR) that is {{under the control of}} the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL 4. Hairpins are extremely difficult to manipulate in Escherichia coli, so our method makes use of a heterologous 330 bp spacer encoding sequences from green fluorescent protein to facilitate the cloning steps. When the UAS–y–IR hairpin is expressed under the control of different promoter–GAL 4 fusions, a high frequency of y pigment phenocopies is obtained in adults. Consequently this method for producing <b>gene</b> <b>knock-outs</b> has several advantages over previous methods in that it is applicable to any gene within the fly genome, greatly facilitates cloning of the hairpin, can be used if required with GAL 4 drivers to avoid lethality or to induce RNAi in a specific developmental stage and/or tissue, is useful for generating knock-outs of adult phenotypes as reported here and, finally, the system can be manipulated to investigate the trans-acting factors that are involved in the RNAi mechanism.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that osteogenic protein– 1 (OP- 1) (bone {{morphogenetic}} protein– 7) {{is responsible for the}} induction of nephrogenic mesenchyme during embryonic kidney devel-opment. <b>Gene</b> <b>knock-out</b> studies showed that OP- 1 null mu-tant mice die of renal failure within the first day of postna-tal life. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of recombinant human OP- 1 for the treatment of acute renal failure after 60 min bilateral renal artery occlusion in rats.
