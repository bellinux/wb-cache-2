40|$|The {{changes in}} cytokeratin intermedial {{filaments}} (<b>IFs)</b> <b>after</b> cytochalasin B (CB) infusion of rat liver in vivo were studied by light and electron microscopy, immunofluorescent staining (IMF), and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The CB treatment caused {{a change in}} the IFs at the cell border associated with {{a change in the}} distribution of microfilaments. The IFs at the cell border were partially disrupted. Actin aggregates were localized at points where IFs had condensed together. The pericanalicular sheath was intact but very dilated. These results indicated that the CB treatment caused an irregular distribution of the microfilaments at the cell periphery but spared the actin at the bile canaliculus. Cytokeratin staining by IMF was markedly decreased or absent; however, IEM clearly showed the presence of nonstaining <b>IFs</b> <b>after</b> CB treatment. These results indicated that the antigenic determinant of normal cytokeratin <b>IFs</b> became masked <b>after</b> CB treatment. The results indicate that F-actin disassembly induced by CB affects both the organization and conformation of cytokeratins associated with loss of integrity of the plasma membrane and vesicular uptake of plasma proteins by hepatocytes...|$|R

5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. <b>If,</b> <b>after</b> a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E
5|$|Karl Mikael Samuelsson (born 23 December 1976) is a Swedish former {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} right winger. Samuelsson {{began his career}} in Sweden, starting with Södertälje SK as a junior in 1994. He went on to also play for Swedish teams IK Nyköping, Frölunda HC and Brynäs <b>IF.</b> <b>After</b> being selected 145th overall in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks, he moved to North America for the 2000–01 NHL season. Samuelsson spent short stints with the Sharks, New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Florida Panthers, before returning to Europe during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. As NHL play resumed, Samuelsson signed with the Detroit Red Wings, where he enjoyed individual and team success, winning the Stanley Cup with the club in 2008. After four seasons in Detroit, he signed with the Vancouver Canucks in July 2009. He enjoyed the two most successful individual seasons of his career with Vancouver, recording back-to-back 50-point campaigns in 2009–10 and 2010–11. In his third year with the club, he {{was traded to the}} Panthers for his second stint in Florida. At the end of the season, he re-signed with the Red Wings in July 2012.|$|E
5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are one colour, the player of that colour wins. <b>If</b> <b>after</b> three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E

5|$|The European Championship final is {{the last}} match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is {{declared}} European champion. As of the 2016 tournament, <b>if</b> <b>after</b> 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The 15 finals to-date have produced five drawn matches, the eventual winners {{of which have been}} determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976) or golden goal (1996, 2000). The winners are awarded a replica of the trophy (the original remains with UEFA), while the losing finalists and semi-finalists are presented with a plaque. Gold and silver medals are awarded to the players of the winning and losing finalists respectively.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup final {{match is}} the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is {{declared}} world champions. <b>If</b> <b>after</b> 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} issuing a {{convective}} watch {{begins with a}} conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. <b>If</b> <b>after</b> collaboration a watch is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue a watch approximation product which {{is followed by the}} local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public of the meaning behind the watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E
