500|$|According to Beyoncé, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] concern a woman's fear of the downsides of love. The protagonist sings about heartache, and the {{possibility}} of a breakup due to the decline of her relationship with an unfaithful lover. She wishes that she did not have to experience this emotional hurt. While her lover is out cheating on <b>her,</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> the woman wonders if she has the courage to continue the relationship, [...] "now that her rock {{has turned out to be}} made of mud", as interpreted by Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music.|$|E
500|$|Summer Cooking was {{illustrated}} by David's friend, the artist Adrian Daintrey. He would visit <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and sketch {{her in the}} kitchen while she cooked a lunch for them both. Unconstrained by the geographical agendas of her first three books, David wrote about dishes from Britain, India, Mauritius, Russia, Spain and Turkey, as well as France, Italy and Greece. [...] The book reflected her strong belief in eating food in season; she loved [...] "the pleasure of rediscovering each season's vegetables" [...] and thought it [...] "rather dull to eat the same food all year round". She said that her aim was to put: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} six Ellen began {{attending}} {{what she}} described as [...] "a filthy elementary school with the five classes in one room". A series of childhood illnesses [...] kept <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> for two years, but she used the time [...] learning [...] to read. On her return to school she made rapid progress, and [...] at the age of 11 [...] won a scholarship to Ardwick Higher Elementary Grade School. Outspoken and often rebellious, after two years she transferred to Stretford Road Secondary School for Girls, an experience she later remembered as [...] "horrid and unmanageable". She made up for the school's shortcomings by reading, with her father's encouragement, the works of Haeckel, Thomas Huxley and Darwin.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became {{friendly}} with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending Mary Lyon's Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (which later became Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, about ten miles (16km) from Amherst. She was at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there. The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick. Whatever the specific reason for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to [...] "bring [...] home at all events". Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities. She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.|$|E
500|$|Dalton {{was born}} in Coosa County, Alabama to Eliza Foscue and John Percival Lee. Her parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Texas in 1849, and they made the trek to Utah Territory shortly after their conversion. In 1851, Dalton's family moved to the San Bernardino Valley in California {{as part of a}} Mormon {{expedition}} led by Amasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich. Seven years later her family moved to Beaver, Utah. Despite her family's poverty, Dalton's parents tried to teach <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and let her attend school as long as possible. [...] There were many children in her family, and at the time, many teenage girls stayed home to help with childcare and housework, but Dalton's family encouraged her to go to school. Since her family moved between rural areas, her education was scattered and not very methodical. Her teacher in Utah tutored her during lunch and after school and started training her to be a teacher herself. At age 12, her father founded a private school where Dalton helped teach. At age 16, Dalton became a teacher herself for an [...] "infant school." ...|$|E
500|$|Stafford's {{first public}} singing {{appearance}} was in Long Beach, {{where the family}} lived when she was twelve. She sang [...] "Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms", a Stafford family sentimental favorite. Her second was far more dramatic. As a student at Long Beach Polytechnic High School with {{the lead in the}} school musical, she was rehearsing on stage when the 1933 Long Beach earthquake destroyed the school. With her mother's encouragement, Stafford originally planned to become an opera singer and studied voice as a child, taking private lessons from Foster Rucker, an announcer on California radio station KNX. Because of the Great Depression, she abandoned that idea and joined her older sisters Christine and Pauline in a popular vocal group The Stafford Sisters. The two older Staffords were already part of a trio with an unrelated third member when the act got a big booking at Long Beach's West Coast Theater. Pauline was too ill to perform, and Jo was drafted in to take her place so they could keep the engagement. She asked her glee club teacher for a week's absence from school, saying her mother needed <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and this was granted. The performance was a success, and Jo became a permanent member of the group.|$|E

500|$|After the {{completion}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, World War II began, and Laughton, realizing his company could no longer film in London, sold O'Hara's contract to RKO. O'Hara later professed that this [...] "broke my heart, I felt completely abandoned in a strange and faraway place". She next featured in John Farrow's A Bill of Divorcement (1940), a remake of George Cukor's 1932 film. O'Hara portrayed Sydney Fairchild, which was played by Katharine Hepburn in the original, in a film which she considered having a [...] "screenplay [...] was mediocre at best". The production was problematic after Farrow reportedly made [...] "suggestive comments" [...] to her and began stalking <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and once he realized that O'Hara {{was not interested in}} him sexually, he began bullying her on set. The feisty O'Hara punched him in the jaw one day, which {{put an end to the}} mistreatment. O'Hara's performance was criticized by reviewers, with the critic from The New York Sun writing that she [...] "lacked the intensity and desperation it must have; nor does she seem to have a sparkle of humor". She next found a role as an aspiring ballerina who performs with a dance troupe [...] in Dance, Girl, Dance (1940). She considered it to have been a physically demanding film, and felt intimidated by Lucille Ball during the production as she had been a former Ziegfeld and Goldwyn girl and was a superior dancer. The two remained friends for many years after the film was completed. Critic Molly Haskell thought that O'Hara was [...] "a little out of her depth in a vaudeville house, not exactly the temple of high art".|$|E
2500|$|Baby Emma Henry {{originated}} {{the role}} and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully [...] "Mummy Shell" [...] and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, [...] "Daddy Sharon". Tully has commented, [...] "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved {{for a couple of}} weeks, I like to visit <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> so she's always relaxed with me." [...] Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, [...] " [...] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.|$|E
