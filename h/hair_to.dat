5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Tatsuguchi left for his new assignment, the IJA {{delivered}} a lock of his <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> Taeko.

5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who had supported him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his beard and <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|All {{the tissues}} are in Aristotle's view {{completely}} uniform parts with no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for example {{was the same}} all the way through, not subdivided into atoms as Democritus (c. 460–c. 370 BC) had argued. The uniform parts can be arranged {{on a scale of}} Aristotelian qualities, from the coldest and driest, such as <b>hair,</b> <b>to</b> the hottest and wettest, such as milk.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{production}} was in Belgrade, {{in the former}} Yugoslavia, in 1969. It was the first <b>Hair</b> <b>to</b> be produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by female producer-director Mira Trailović at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan Nikolić, Branko Milićević, Seka Sablić and Dušan Prelević. Over four years, the production received 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local references in the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia's traditional rival.|$|E
40|$|Water stress {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> cause root <b>hairs</b> <b>to</b> become short and bulbous. Because abscisic acid (ABA) mediates a variety of water-stress responses, we {{investigated}} the response of Arabidopsis thaliana root <b>hairs</b> <b>to</b> ABA. When wild-type root hairs were treated with ABA, they exhibited the water-stress response. The Arabidopsis mutants abi 1 and abi 2, which are insensitive to ABA at the seedling stage, did not display the root hair response. These data suggest that ABA may mediate the response of root <b>hairs</b> <b>to</b> water stress. The drought response of root hairs resulting in an inhibition of tip growth will provide an easy screen to select mutations that are insensitive to ABA and/or involved in tip growth...|$|R

5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires {{plenty of food}} energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E

The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio.

5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{was described}} by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, as Falco nisus, but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The current scientific name {{is derived from the}} Latin accipiter, meaning 'hawk' and nisus, the sparrowhawk. According to Greek mythology, Nisus, the king of Megara, was turned into a sparrowhawk after his daughter, Scylla, cut off his purple lock of <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> present to her lover (and Nisus' enemy), Minos.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Poe {{first met}} his cousin Virginia in August 1829, {{four months after}} his {{discharge}} from the Army. She was seven at the time. In 1832, the family – made up of Elizabeth, Maria, Virginia, and Virginia's brother Henry – {{was able to use}} Elizabeth's pension to rent a home at what was then 3 North Amity Street in Baltimore. Poe's older brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who had been living with the family, had recently died on August 1, 1831. Poe joined the household in 1833 and was soon smitten by a neighbor named Mary Devereaux. The young Virginia served as a messenger between the two, at one point retrieving a lock of Devereaux's <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> give to Poe. Elizabeth Cairnes Poe died on July 7, 1835, effectively ending the family's income and making their financial situation even more difficult. Henry died around this time, sometime before 1836, leaving Virginia as Maria Clemm's only surviving child.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> stay young.|$|E

The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from <b>hair</b> <b>to</b> hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
