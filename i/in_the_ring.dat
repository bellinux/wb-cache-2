Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, fought Lance Hoyt in the following encounter.

Finally, Styles slammed Joe face-first into the mat with his signature Styles Clash maneuver. Joe kicked out of the following pin, leading to an exchange which allowed Joe to place Styles in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold. After a brief period of time, Styles passed out and the referee awarded Joe the victory and thus became the new TNA X Division Champion at 18 minutes and 58 seconds in. After the match, Joe bashed Styles in the face with the TNA X Division Championship belt and then set up to slam him on a steel chair <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> but was foalied by Christopher Daniels coming to Styles' defense. A brawl ensued between Joe and Daniels, leading to security breaking it up.|$|E

London attempted to perform a powerbomb but Kidman countered with a sitout facebuster for a near-fall. The match concluded when Kidman executed a Shooting star press on London for the win.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> but fell off one by one. With nobody left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the two-beam study of {{indirect}} excitons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exciton emission pattern. One laser beam generates <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> and a second weaker beam is positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ring.</b> <b>The</b> beam positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> is found to locally suppress the exciton emission intensity. We also report on <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> fragmentation and formation of multiple <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> region. These features are found to originate from a weak spatial modulation of the excitation beam intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> region. <b>The</b> modulation of exciton emission intensity anticorrelates with the modulation of the laser excitation intensity. <b>The</b> three phenomena—inner <b>ring</b> fragmentation, formation of multiple <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> region, and emission suppression by a weak laser beam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner ring—have a common feature: a reduction of exciton emission intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region of enhanced laser excitation. This effect is {{explained in terms of}} exciton transport and thermalization...|$|R
5|$|The tournament to crown {{the inaugural}} CMLL World Heavyweight Champion ran from May 24 to June 9, 1991, and {{featured}} 16 competitors. The {{first round of}} the tournament saw two eight-man battle royals, each ending when four wrestlers were left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> This was used to cut the field in half with the last four remaining wrestlers from each match advancing to the next round. Konnan, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., Black Magic, and Mascara Ano 2000 advanced in the first battle royal, while Brazo de Plata, Vampiro Canadiense, Universo 2000, and El Egipcio were eliminated. In the second battle royal, Nitron, Pierroth Jr., Pirata Morgan, and Cien Caras advanced while Fabulous Blondie, Gran Markus Jr., Máscara Sagrada, and El Egipcio were eliminated. The second round saw another pair of battle royals with four men in each, ending when two wrestlers were left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> This narrowed the tournament down to the final four wrestlers, who faced off in traditional semi-finals matches, before the final match to crown the inaugural champion.|$|E
5|$|This {{match was}} {{followed}} by the Tag Team Championship match. The match started slowly, but both teams soon began brawling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> The Harts focused on Pierre, but Jacques was eventually able to tag in to rescue him. After Pierre regained the advantage, Owen tagged in and took control of the match. He applied the Sharpshooter to Jacques, but Pierre broke the hold. Bret tagged in but fell out of the ring and kayfabe hurt his knee when the Quebecers' manager pulled on the ropes. The Quebecers focused on Bret's knee until Bret regained the advantage and attempted to apply the Sharpshooter. He was not able to stand, however, so the referee stopped the match and awarded the victory to the Quebecers. After the match, Owen yelled at Bret for not tagging out of the match. He then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Hockey Stick Fight with Kip James as Special Guest Referee between 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) followed. In this match, {{hockey sticks}} were hung above {{each of the}} {{turnbuckles}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> with only the legal men allowed to use them. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Killings pinned Young after a top rope leg drop onto a hockey stick that laid across Young's groin to win the match for his team at 10 minutes and 23 seconds. After this bout, Christian Cage made his debut, announcing he wanted to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode came out and offered Cage a spot in Team Canada, which Cage said he would consider.|$|E

50|$|A {{single cell}} SRR has {{a pair of}} {{enclosed}} loops with splits in them at opposite ends. The loops are made of nonmagnetic metal like copper and have a small gap between them. The loops can be concentric, or square, and gapped as needed. A magnetic flux penetrating <b>the</b> metal <b>rings</b> will induce rotating currents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rings,</b> which produce their own flux to enhance or oppose the incident field (depending on the SRRs resonant properties). This field pattern is dipolar. Due to splits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> <b>the</b> structure can support resonant wavelengths {{much larger than the}} diameter of <b>the</b> <b>rings.</b> This would not happen <b>in</b> closed <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> small gaps between <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> produces large capacitance values which lower the resonating frequency. The dimensions of the structure are small compared to the resonant wavelength. This results in low radiative losses, and very high quality factors.|$|R
