5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nollette sneaks {{into the}} {{cryogenic}} facility and tampers with Grable's storage unit, thawing his remains. Roland {{returns to the}} lab {{and is in the}} process of pushing the prototype engine to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care <b>home,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} {{concern over the}} safety of children in this period, prompted by high infant mortality. The abolition of godparents in the Reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising the role and responsibilities of fathers. Wet-nurses were used for young children, but in most families mothers took the primary role in bringing up children, while the Kirk emphasised {{the role of the}} father for older children. After the Reformation there was an increasing emphasis on education, resulting in the growth of a parish school system, but its effects were limited for the children of the poor and for girls. Most children left home for a period of life-cycle service, in which youths left <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> domestic or agricultural servants, or to become apprentices, and which ended when they married and established independent households.|$|E

5|$|HMS Duncan was a D-class {{destroyer}} leader {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935 where she remained until mid-1939. Duncan returned to the Mediterranean Fleet just after World War II began in September 1939. She was transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939, although she was badly damaged in a collision the following month, and required repairs that lasted until July 1940. The ship joined Force H at Gibraltar in October, escorting the larger ships and various convoys until March 1941 when she was transferred to West Africa for convoy escort duties for a few months. Duncan rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar in July and escorted several convoys to Malta {{during the rest of the}} year. After a refit, she briefly returned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla before joining the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean to participate in Operation Ironclad in May 1942. The ship was recalled <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> converted into an escort destroyer in late 1942.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due {{to having the}} most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider Sweet <b>Home</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first true survival horror game.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a request from the New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for command of the Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was {{the last line of}} defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as the commander of the Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and {{for the next few months}} oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E

The analysis of the 2001 RECS data shows that householders in newlyconstructed homes perceived their <b>homes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better insulated and less drafty than do householders in older homes. Single-family <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better insulated and less drafty than are apartments in buildings with two to four units. Cross-variable comparisons also provide the associations between the level of insulation and winter drafts in the homes with household characteristics and location of the home...|$|R
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the adopted {{daughter}} of Mr. Sanbourne and Ruby Lincoln and the adoptive sister of Eve Russell, who is Ruby's daughter {{from a previous}} marriage. Eve and Liz are both unaware of the adoption, believing that they were half-sisters. Mr. Sanbourne repeatedly molested Liz after Eve left <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a nightclub singer, and a prostitute, and start a relationship with businessman Julian Crane. Liz blamed Eve for abandoning her to her father's sexual abuse. When she was fourteen, Liz went to Boston in search of Eve. She tracked down Julian at a jazz club {{to talk to him}} about her sister and their relationship. Later that night, Alistair Crane, Julian's father, raped Liz in his son's apartment; Julian was passed out in a drunken stupor in the same room and was unaware of what happened. The rape resulted in Liz's pregnancy with Chad Harris-Crane, who was later believed to be Eve and Julian's son; Liz gave up her baby for adoption at birth, and was forced to undergo surgery that left her barren.|$|E
