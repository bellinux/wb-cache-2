500|$|The {{technology}} used in constructing skyscrapers continued to develop. Time was increasingly {{a factor in}} the projects, and architects and their specialist teams developed faster ways to design and construct the buildings to minimise the <b>interest</b> payments <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> and hasten the arrival of rental income. By 1930, skyscrapers were being erected in just 12 months by teams of workers totalling 5,000 men, with four floors being assembled in a typical week. Building skyscraper towers involved some adaption of engineering techniques, as effectively two different buildings were being designed – the base and the tower – which needed to be efficiently linked using elevators and other service facilities. Most new offices settled around a standard size, [...] wide by [...] deep, depending on the height of the ceiling, with multiple small windows considered better than a few larger ones.

40|$|The “Zero-Energy {{guideline}} for Building Social Housing” is {{an outcome}} of the ECO-Life project in Kortrijk, where the poor and almost forgotten social housing neighbourhood Venning from the 1960 s is turned into an exemplary sustainable and zero-carbon neighbourhood anno 2010 - 2016, and a new zero-energy multi-family building rises at the Pottenbakkershoek site in Kortrijk. This document is a written residue of {{the experiences of the}} various ECO-Life partners – architects and planners, engineers, owner and university - went through and the challenges they encountered. It encloses their overall vision and approach, its projection on the actual case-study, insights from scientific perspective and the variety of issues that occurred and considerations that were made throughout the design, building and operational phase. As such this document is not an absolute and indisputable bible, nor a cooking book with recipes for the perfect sustainable and zero-carbon neighbourhood. It is rather an exposition of the various ingredients that we think are important, and the how we treated them in this specific case. Therefore the reader is invited to learn from our experiences, to discuss them critically and to reinterpret them for his own projects. The document is structured in a more or less chronological order of the building process, starting with the overall vision and definition of the targets, and ending with the maintenance and performance of the buildings during the operational phase. Indeed, it is important {{to take into account the}} long-term aspects of building from the design stage onwards. In the second chapter the concepts of ‘sustainability’ and ‘zero-energy’ are clarified and translated into characteristics and definitions. In chapter three the specificities of the architectural and technical design of sustainable zero-buildings are named and in chapter four some economic aspects are handled. In the fifth chapter the points of <b>interest</b> <b>during</b> the <b>construction</b> phase and commissioning of the buildings is discussed.

30|$|This {{capital cost}} method is {{comparable}} to the method in GETEM with a few simplifications. GETEM considers a more detailed exploration, development and construction scheme where capital costs can be distributed over different years, and different discount rates can be assigned to different years. In GEOPHIRES, we consider the capital costs occur overnight and a lumped capital cost multiplier is available to capture effects such as capital cost escalation and debt on <b>interest</b> <b>during</b> <b>construction.</b> Further, unlike GETEM, GEOPHIRES does not consider capital costs for leasing, permitting and transmission lines. However, they could be manually added by the user as an additional capital cost term. While GEOPHIRES v 1.0 only considered 15 % contingency on drilling costs, all capital cost terms in GEOPHIRES v 2.0 now consider 15 % to align with more standard practices (as in GETEM). Similar to GETEM, no process contingency is considered in GEOPHIRES v 2.0. However, if deemed applicable to a project, the user can manually account for process contingency by assigning a multiplier to the capital cost correlations (e.g., 1.2 for 20 % process contingency).|$|E

40|$|Submitted to the Department of Nuclear Engineering On May 16, 1978 in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Nuclear Engineering. While there is a consensus regarding the need for extensive regulation of the nuclear power industry, the regulatory process {{has been the subject}} of almost constant controversy during recent years. Those subject to regulation complain that regulation is inefficient, that it causes unnecessary licensing and construction delays, and costs; the opponents of nuclear power charge that regulation is inadequate. This study is an effort to evaluate the performance of the regulatory process to which nuclear power plants are subject. The study is subdivided into three parts. Part one presents an analysis of the effects of regulation upon the leadtime and costs of Nuclear Power Plants in the United States. Licensing and construction delays and power plant cost increases caused by regulatory decisions during the past decade are evaluated. Part two is a brief review of the evolving differences between nuclear power plants and its main rival for base load generation, coal-fired plants, from the viewpoint of the electric utility planners. Finally, in Part three, the fundamental problems of the current regulatory process are assessed, and suggestions regarding how to address these problems are presented. The study is based on a survey of electric utility companies and on data available in the literature. The findings can be summarized as follows: 1. The liberal rules of the NRC licensing hearings and the lack of coordination between the NRC and state agencies are the major sources of uncertainty in the licensing of nuclear plants; 2. Redesigns and field reworks imposed by the NRC are responsible for an average of 50 % of construction delays (15 months); 3. The increasing construction duration, resulting in and increasing amount of <b>interest</b> <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> has been the major cause of the rapid escalation of nuclear plant capital costs in the recent years. There appears to be a stabilization of the real value (constant dollars, excluding <b>interest</b> <b>during</b> <b>construction)</b> of nuclear plants coming on line after 1973; 4. The historically observed frequent and costly "ratchetings" and "backfittings" of nuclear plants were the inevitable result of the course of commercialization chosen by the industry rather than the consequence of inefficient regulation; 5. The current mix of political and technical issues which must be considered at the level of the NRC in licensing nuclear plants is identified as the major weakness of the current regulatory process; 6. The disparity between the "actuarial" view and the "catastrophic" view of the risks of nuclear energy indicates the need for formal consideration of social values in decision making.

These changes include updated wind resource maps, seasonal and diurnal capacity factor variations, and inclusion of offshore wind resources from South Carolina to Texas. The wind and conventional generation technology cost and performance projections were developed by Black and Veatch in consultation with AWEA industry experts. The assumptions regarding the large, regional planning and operation structure of the transmission system were developed in coordination with experts on the Transmission Task Force and among AWEA industry experts. The financial assumptions and the region definitions were unchanged from the WinDS Base Case.
