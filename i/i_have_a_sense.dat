500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|E
500|$|Love denied ever telling Wilson [...] "don't {{fuck with}} the formula", {{adding that the}} Beach Boys [...] "have no formula. In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of what {{connects with}} people like me. [...] We're not {{culturally}} Republicans. [...] We're not libertarians. [...] We're not neo-conservatives or former liberals. [...] We're just old-fashioned, blue-collar social conservatives. [...] These are people who couldn't care less about politics, {{want to be left}} alone by government, but if their country calls for them to fight abroad, will. [...] You win elections by cultivating people like me.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{came from}} an {{extraordinarily}} dysfunctional family, full of abuse and alcoholism... It's {{hard to say what}} drives a three year-old, but <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that nature was my solace, and nature was a place in which there was beauty, in which there was order." ...|$|R
60|$|There came {{a little}} jerk, a noise like {{champagne}} being uncorked in another room, and a faint whistling sound. For just one instant <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of enormous tension, a transient conviction that my feet were pressing downward {{with a force}} of countless tons. It lasted for an infinitesimal time.|$|R
60|$|I can't explain myself, I perceive. Perhaps it {{all comes}} to this, that I am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits. Naturally I resist that as a {{complete}} solution. Anyhow, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of inexorable need, of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable, {{and for a time}} this aeronautical engineering allayed it....|$|R
2500|$|Regarding SA {{for both}} motor {{movements}} and thoughts, further distinctions {{may be found}} in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness. For example, while typing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; {{this is an example of}} SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions themselves. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements per se but rather, I am involved with the task at hand. [...] If I'm subsequently asked if I just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious [...] "attribution" [...] of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, pre-reflective [...] "sense" [...] of agency.|$|E
2500|$|While Walter {{had many}} {{influences}} within music, in his Of Music and Making (1957) he notes a profound influence from the philosopher Rudolf Steiner. He notes, [...] "In old age I {{have had the}} good fortune to be initiated into the world of anthroposophy and during the past few years to make a profound study of the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Here we see alive and in operation that deliverance of which Friedrich Hölderlin speaks; its blessing has flowed over me, and so this book is the confession of belief in anthroposophy. There is no part of my inward life that has not had new light shed upon it, or been stimulated, by the lofty teachings of Rudolf Steiner ... I am profoundly grateful for having been so boundlessly enriched ... It is glorious to become a learner again at my time of life. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the rejuvenation of my whole being which gives strength and renewal to my musicianship, even to my music-making." ...|$|E
60|$|Object. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of nothing; then, by your argument, I {{must not}} pray at all.|$|E
6000|$|I started {{slightly}} at the question, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of recognising it: George Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me {{face to face}} with it. It had embarrassed me then, but it didn't embarrass me now, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it. [...] "A real gentleman? Emphatically not!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{faint smile}} on Mrs. Heckman's demure lips, but Wallace, astute lawyer that he was, {{presented}} the bland face of a poker player. Without a direct word being spoken I was made to understand that Miss Taft was not indifferent to my coming, and when at half-past eleven we started for Eagle's Nest <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of committing myself to a perilous campaign.|$|R
6000|$|PHOEBE. He was so amusing {{from the}} first. I am thankful, Susan, that <b>I</b> too <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour. <b>I</b> am {{exceedingly}} funny at times; am I not, Susan? ...|$|R
6000|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. A very {{agreeable}} age {{to associate}} with, I find. I am recovering rapidly. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of blossoming like a flower. May I ask your name? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since I may {{not help}} myself otherwise," [...] said Everard, [...] "I swear, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{religion}} and honour, I will say nothing of this violence, nor make any search after those who are concerned in it." ...|$|E
60|$|If I throw a ball, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of effort}} which ends {{when the ball}} leaves my hand; and if I catch a ball, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{resistance}} which {{comes to an end}} with the quiescence of the ball. In the former case, there is a strong suggestion of something having gone from myself into the ball; in the latter, of something having been received from the ball. Let any one hold a piece of iron near a strong magnet, and the feeling that the magnet endeavours to pull the iron one way {{in the same manner as}} he endeavours to pull it in the opposite direction, is very strong.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that {{even at the}} sight of him <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of impending calamity. He sat under the electric light with the shadow of his hair making bars down his face. He looked shrunken, and as though his skin had suddenly got loose and yellow. The decorations of the room seemed to have lost freshness, and outside the blinds were up--there was not so much fog as a dun darkness. One saw the dingy outlines of the chimneys opposite quite distinctly, and then a sky of such brown as only London can display.|$|R
6000|$|... "But--!" [...] I did {{not feel}} angry. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no sort of jealousy, no wounded pride, no sense of injury. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of grey desolation, of hopeless cross-purposes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; evidently she didn't {{get that}} will from her father. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> still <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{exhaustion}} {{from it in}} our own case. What {{do you think it}} portends for poor Kendricks!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Conscience," [...] he repeated. [...] "You {{ought to}} know me better, Brooks, than to suppose me possessed of such a thing. No; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of justice, that is all--a sort of {{weakness}} for seeing the scales held fairly. Now, don't {{you think it is}} reasonable that she should accept this money from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare not}} say that it would not," [...] said Redclyffe, [...] "for I know I have a {{thousand}} weaknesses, and have doubtless as many more that I never suspected myself of. But {{it seems to me}} at this moment impossible that I should ever have such an ambition, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of meanness in not starting fair, in beginning the world with advantages that my fellows have not." ...|$|E
60|$|Far, {{far away}} I have {{a memory of}} having lived, a smaller lad, by the tree- lined banks of a stream. And as the wagon jolts along, and I sway on the seat with my father, I {{continually}} return and dwell upon that pleasant water flowing between the trees. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that for an interminable period I have lived in a wagon and travelled on, ever on, with this present company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes.... Well, to be plain.... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{immediate}} <b>sense</b> of God. I saw the world--as {{if it were}} {{a transparent}} curtain, and then God became--evident.... Is it possible for that to determine the drug?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Returning home on this {{particular}} day of days, I paused upon the bridge, and watched for awhile the lazy barges manoeuvring their way between the piers. It was one of those hushed summer evenings when the air even of grim cities is full of whispering voices; and as, turning away from the river, I passed through the white toll-gate, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of leaving myself behind me on the bridge. So vivid was the impression, that I looked back, half expecting to see myself still leaning over the iron parapet, looking down into the sunlit water.|$|R
6000|$|I don't think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{word with}} him or {{anything}} but a hurried hand clasp. I am not sure. It {{has gone out of}} my mind. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very clear and certain memory of my phase of bleak desolation as I watched his car recede and climb and vanish over Mapleborough Hill, and that I got there my first full and definite intimation that, after all, this great Change and my new wide aims in life, were not to mean indiscriminate happiness for me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of protest, as against extreme unfairness, as I saw him go. [...] "It is too soon," [...] I said to myself, [...] "to leave me alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but {{how hard}} it is to realise that we are on the earth now. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of it, though, when the moon breaks from one flying cloud to another. Then it seems as if I were a {{passenger}} on some vast, shapeless ship sailing through the air. What," [...] he asked, with no relevancy that I could perceive, [...] "was the strangest feeling YOU ever had?" [...] I remembered asking girls such questions when I was young, and their not apparently thinking it at all odd.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither would I deserve your suspicions, kinsman," [...] {{answered}} Aunt Margaret, [...] "if we {{were speaking}} of any incident {{occurring in the}} actual business of human life. But for all this, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of superstition about me, which I {{do not wish to}} part with. It is a feeling which separates me from this age, and links me with that to which I am hastening; and even when it seems, as now, to lead me to the brink of the grave, and bid me gaze on it, I do not love that it should be dispelled. It soothes my imagination, without influencing my reason or conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|Christmas {{came to us}} {{this year}} with new and tender significance, for [...] "Santy Claus" [...] (who found us at home in New York, rejoicing in our first baby) brought to us our first tree, and the {{conjunction}} of these happy events produced in my wife almost perfect happiness. Furthermore, Mary Isabel achieved her first laugh. I am sure of this fact, for I put it down in my notebook, with these words, [...] "She has a lovely smile and a chuckle like her grandmother's. She robs us of solitude, and system, and order, but our world would now be desolate without her." [...] Only when I thought of what her grandfather was missing did <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of regret.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vague <b>sense</b> of {{movement}} outside that window." [...] He caught up {{his gun and}} approached it. [...] "No, there's nothing to be seen, and yet <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> sworn that something passed slowly across it." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of humor}} about the name Sleze. But when Layne came home {{and said they were}} {{changing}} the name to Alice 'N Chains, I was not happy. I said, 'Honey, that is female bondage. You don't want to choose a name like that - it's going to push your female audience away. I really feel strong about this.' He was adamant and I was adamant. For {{the first time in my}} life, <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> much of <b>a</b> conversation with him for about two weeks, because I was concerned, and also offended. How could my child possibly choose a name like 'Alice N' Chains? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the book came when Benioff {{returned}} home to New York for Passover while he was away working in Wyoming. He suffered from appendicitis and had to undergo emergency surgery. Benioff said: [...] "Walking the halls of Mount Sinai afterward, seeing people walking up 5th Avenue and Central Park and trapped in the hospital, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of being {{so close to the}} city and not being a part of it." [...] He continued: [...] "I thought, 'What if you are not stuck for five days, but seven years?' And that is writing what you don't know. Taking a banal problem and making it much more serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘From {{what does}} all this spring?’ said the Prince, {{stopping}} in his walk. ‘What am I to call it? Diffidence? The fear of ridicule? Inverted vanity? What matter names, if it has brought me to this? I could never bear to be bustling about nothing; I was ashamed of this toy kingdom from the first; I could not tolerate that people should fancy I believed in a thing so patently absurd! I would do nothing that cannot be done smiling. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour, forsooth! I must know better than my Maker. And it was the same thing in my marriage,’ he added more hoarsely. ‘I did not believe this girl could care for me; I must not intrude; I must preserve the foppery of my indifference. What an impotent picture!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Since then I {{have been}} going to and fro at very brief {{intervals}} in my favourite book; and I have now just risen from my last (let me call it my fifth) perusal, having liked it better and admired it more seriously than ever. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of ownership, being so well known in these six volumes. Perhaps I think that d'Artagnan delights to have me read of him, and Louis Quatorze is gratified, and Fouquet throws me a look, and Aramis, although he knows I do not love him, yet plays to me with his best graces, as to an old patron of the show. Perhaps, if I am not careful, something may befall me like what befell George IV. about the battle of Waterloo, and I may come to fancy the [...] "Vicomte" [...] one of the first, and Heaven knows the best, of my own works. At least, I avow myself a partisan; and when I compare {{the popularity of the}} [...] "Vicomte" [...] with that of [...] "Monte Cristo," [...] or its own elder brother, the [...] "Trois Mousquetaires," [...] I confess I am both pained and puzzled.|$|E

6000|$|We were awakened at dawn by {{the ringing}} {{beat of the}} iron mauls as Frank and David drove the stakes to hold the [...] "power" [...] to the ground. The rattle of trace chains, the clash of iron rods, the clang of steel bars, intermixed with the {{laughter}} of the men, came sharply through the frosty air, {{and the smell of}} sizzling sausage from the kitchen warned us that our busy mother was hurrying the breakfast forward. Knowing {{that it was time to}} get up, although it was not yet light, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of being awakened into a romantic new world, a world of heroic action.|$|R
6000|$|MARTHA--[Springing to her feet--indignantly.] It's {{a case of}} evil minds, {{it seems}} to me--and it would be {{extremely}} insulting if <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor.

5000|$|Reid {{said of her}} writing: [...] "A lot {{of people}} take {{inspiration}} from it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> black <b>sense</b> of humour, <b>I</b> think you <b>have</b> to have in this situation. You {{have to try to}} keep going and tell it like it is." ...|$|R
