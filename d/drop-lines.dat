Additionally, Bain was required to correctly position the fabric {{to allow it to}} ignite. Another part of the IPT hypothesizes that the mooring cables, which were designed to ground any static electricity {{on the surface of the}} airship, worked only partly in this instance; since some of the skin panels still carried an electric charge, at least one of them must have sparked, causing the initial outbreak of fire. Thus it has yet to be proven that an electrical charge could ignite the Hindenburg skin. The design of the ship would likely exclude the skin being an ignition point due to the properties of the doping process, the insulation from the frame and skin of the grounding <b>drop-lines,</b> and the inability of any experiment to ignite the skin via electric spark consistent with the conditions of the 1937 disaster.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to explore the value of fish traps and <b>drop-lines</b> for {{monitoring}} changes in catch rates of fish species of commercial and recreational importance on the central Great Barrier Reef. Emphasis {{of the study was}} on: 1) quantifying the catch variability within a single depth zone on two different reefs 2) determining the (statistical) sampling power of the traps to detect changes in catch rates, and 3) determining the extent to which spatially stratifying sampling within the depth zone could increase the power to detect change...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of different monocular depth cues on the understanding of a tactical situation in 3 D visual displays. The depth cue conditions were target symbol, target symbol with drop-shadow, and target symbol with drop-line. The tactical understanding {{was defined as the}} accuracy in perception of 3 D bearing (measured through Azimuth and Elevation) between own-ship and target symbols. Perhaps the most important result from these experiments with respect to design issues is that the differences between the depth cue conditions are minimal. That means that the need for drop-shadows or <b>drop-lines</b> is limited, which is good from a cluttering perspective...|$|E
60|$|At length it happened, one calm day in {{the latter}} part of summer, that I was {{relaxing}} myself from the toils of severe study by a day's amusement in fishing in those waters which had been the favorite resort of my boyhood. I was in company with several worthy burghers of my native city. Our sport was indifferent; the fish did not bite freely; and we had frequently changed our fishing ground without bettering our luck. We at length anchored close under a ledge of rocky coast, on the eastern side of the island of Manhata. It was a still, warm day. The stream whirled and dimpled by us without a wave or even a ripple, and every thing was so calm and quiet that it was almost startling when the kingfisher would pitch himself from the branch of some dry tree, and after suspending himself for a moment in the air to take his aim, would souse into the smooth water after his prey. While we were lolling in our boat, half drowsy with the warm stillness of the day and the dullness of our sport, one of our party, a worthy alderman, was overtaken by a slumber, and, as he dozed, suffered the sinker of his <b>drop-line</b> to lie upon the bottom of the river. On waking, he found he had caught something of importance, from the weight; on drawing it to the surface, we were much surprised to find a long pistol of very curious and outlandish fashion, which, from its rusted condition, and its stock being worm-eaten and covered with barnacles, appeared to have been a long time under water. The unexpected appearance of this document of warfare occasioned much speculation among my pacific companions. One supposed it to have fallen there during the revolutionary war. Another, from the peculiarity of its fashion, attributed it to the voyagers in the earliest days of the settlement; perchance to the renowned Adrian Block, who explored the Sound and discovered Block Island, since so noted for its cheese. But a third, after regarding it for some time, pronounced it to be of veritable Spanish workmanship.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the possibilities of using 3 D perspective displays in different military settings, and to illustrate the limitations of 3 D displays, that is, when 2 D displays are to be preferred. More specifically, this thesis explores (a) readability during vibrations, (b) perception aspects on perspective aircraft displays, and (c) the valueÂ of spatial cues in 3 D air traffic displays in military settings. The results show, for example, that vertical vibrations influence recognition performance negatively. The recognition of 2 D and 3 D symbols, as well as judgment of relations between symbols on a 3 D display, may indeed be an arduous task. Results, further, indicate improved performance for relation judgments between objects in 3 D space in dynamic rather than static scenarios in tactical indicators. In situations where perception of a direction nevertheless is problematic, enhancements like, for example, <b>drop-lines</b> may improve performance. From a practical point of view the goal has been to investigate the possibility to develop and use a 3 D perspective display in an airplane like JAS 39 Gripen. A general conclusion is that 3 D displays indeed {{can be used in}} many situations {{but it is important to}} seriously consider any possible limitations of 3 D displays. The future work should be focused on implementing and testing the tactical display in a real setting with real military pilots...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA complex balance {{has arisen}} between the bluefin tuna, killer whales, and human {{activities}} in the Strait of Gibraltar. Recent changes in fishing effort have dramatically decreased tuna stocks, breaking this balance. Killer whales exhibit two strategies for feeding on tuna: active hunting and depredation on a drop-line fishery. From 1999 to 2011, a small community of 39 individuals was observed in the Strait in spring and summer. All individuals displayed active hunting and 18 of them also depredated on the fishery. These differences in foraging behaviour influenced life-history parameters. Adult survival for interacting and non-interacting individuals was estimated at 0. 991 (SE = 0. 011) and 0. 901 (SE = 0. 050), respectively. Juvenile survival could only be estimated for interacting individuals as 0. 966 (SE = 0. 024), because only one juvenile and one calf were observed among non-interacting individuals. None of the interacting calves survived after 2005, following the decrease in drop-line fishery catches. Calving rate was estimated at 0. 22 (SE = 0. 02) for interacting individuals and 0. 02 (SE = 0. 01) for non-interacting. Calving interval, which could only be calculated for interacting groups, was 7 years. The population growth rate was positive at 4 % for interacting individuals, and no growth was observed for non-interacting individuals. These differences in demographic parameters {{could be explained by}} access to larger tuna through depredation. Consequently, we found that whales would need more tuna to cover their daily energy requirements while actively hunting. Therefore, our findings suggest an effect of artificial food provisioning on their survival and reproductive output. Urgent actions are needed to ensure the conservation of this, already small, community of killer whales. These include its declaration as Endangered, the implementation of a conservation plan, the creation of a seasonal management area where activities producing underwater noise (i. e. military exercise, seismic surveys or even whale watching activities) are forbidden from March to August, and the promotion of bluefin tuna conservation. Additionally, energetic requirements of this whale community should be taken into account when undertaking ecosystem-based fishery management for the Atlantic bluefin tuna stock. In the meantime, as marine predators are most sensitive to changes in fish abundance when prey abundance is low, we suggest an urgent short-term action. Artisanal fisheries, such as <b>drop-lines,</b> should be promoted instead of purse seiners in the Mediterranean Sea. This will help to maintain the survival and reproductive output of the whale community until showing clear signs of recovery and stability, and/or their prey stock recovers...|$|E
