5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, it was {{announced}} Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain, and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Paddy Considine, was involved in negotiations for Rorschach. Jude Law (a fan of the comic) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct Watchmen teaser website that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> board as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director {{he did not think}} the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including Watchmen, were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmens budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount’s CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround, again.|$|E

Tabor gave her $5000 on the spot. Baby Doe then <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>message,</b> and $1000, delivered to Sandelowsky, in which she declared that she would not marry him. Instead, Tabor moved her to the Clarendon Hotel, next to the opera house and Sandelowsky's store, Sands, Pelton & Company. Sandelowsky later moved to Aspen, where he opened another store, married, and built a house.|$|E

Eko soon prepares to board Oceanic Airlines Flight 815; shortly after buying a ticket, he encounters the girl whom the investigation is about.

500|$|Before {{the success}} of [...] "Day 'n' Nite", the rapper had {{said that he would}} never try to mix {{politics}} or jocular things in with his lyrical content. After realizing the power of his voice he then decided to make important and unique songs, focusing on the message, rather than just creating inane music. He said his mode of operation at that time [...] "was just, 'Hey, I'm making these cool sounding songs and I have little messages in them'", but still had himself in it. Although Cudi <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> in every track, he chose to avoid using dense lyrics, explaining {{that he did not want}} to write material that he would not actually say or use in real life, adding that being true to yourself entirely was meaningful to him. [...] "I don't speak like a fucking nerdy guy; I speak like a regular dude", he remarked.|$|E
500|$|Many albums feature {{one or more}} {{songs in}} which the band lampoons itself, notably in the lyrics to [...] "Sucks" [...] and [...] "Inane".

In the 1995 song [...] "Terror", Konietzko specifically warns, [...] "Fundamentalist forces are undermining the integrity of liberal and democratic political structures". Samples of news broadcasts and speeches by political leaders are sometimes featured in songs. Konietzko has said that while the 2003 album WWIII is critical of then-president George W. Bush, who was sampled extensively for the album, [...] "It's not an anti-Bush record per se, it's an anti-stupidity record", and, [...] "If we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>message,</b> it would be: Think for Yourself and Don't Believe the Bullshit." ...|$|E

Grant Nicholas cited on the band's Facebook page, that the single was released purely for the Japanese tsunami disaster with the chart position not being as important. During their 2011 touring, Feeder introduced drummer Damon Wilson as a live regular and session musician. In September 2011, the band revealed on their Facebook page that the recording of their yet-untitled eighth studio album is complete with only mixing on the final song to be finalised, before mastering then began on 30 September in New York.

2500|$|Distributed maximal {{independent}} set algorithms {{are strongly}} influenced by algorithms on the PRAM model. The original work by Luby and Alon et al. has led to several distributed algorithms. In terms of exchange of bits, these algorithms <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> size lower bound per round of [...] bits and would require additional characteristics of the graph. For example, {{the size of the}} graph would need to be known or the maximum degree of neighboring vertices for a given vertex could be queried.
