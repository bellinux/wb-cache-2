5|$|At the school, the {{principal}} tells the legless man’s janitor guise {{that she was}} very worried when he did not show up that morning. Trevor, a bully who had earlier tormented Quinton, sees partially through the beggar's forms for a moment. Trevor later shows up at Quinton’s home to say he is sorry and says he thinks <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> killed his father.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his group}} begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and catch them, but immediately ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E

5|$|Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, Alfred, deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is {{imprisoned by}} The Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, Robin, after {{realising}} that the Caped Crusader {{could use a}} hand. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but realizing {{that he does not}} have it in him to murder, Robin spares him. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman then rescues both Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to Arkham Asylum and imprisoned, but he claims <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.|$|E
25|$|The others leave but {{a moment}} later Poirot suffers a small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor his opinion of the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer wanted to be on the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that can only have been to have hidden something from sight at the moment that the room was broken into. As the Dictaphone is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only be someone who had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E
500|$|Cooper retires {{to bed at}} {{his hotel}} room, and {{experiences}} a strange dream featuring the one-armed man, who identifies himself as MIKE, and BOB, who vows to [...] "kill again". Cooper then dreams {{he is in a}} room hung with red curtains. The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) and Laura Palmer speak to him in a jarring and disjointed manner, before Laura leans over to whisper in his ear. Cooper wakes up, telephones Harry, and declares that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> the murderer is.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Stan now has 845,323 friends (almost {{all of whom}} {{he hardly}} knows or does not know) on his account and has finally decided to delete it, {{only to find that}} Facebook refuses to allow him to. Instead of {{deleting}} his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the virtual world of Facebook, where he meets [...] "profiles" [...] of everyone <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as Yahtzee. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's Farm Town farm, blaming Kyle for getting him [...] "sucked into Facebook" [...] in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at Café World. Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him.|$|E
500|$|Michael and Bird {{investigate}} in the case, and Michael, with evidence, {{finds out}} where Rex is, and runs away. Meanwhile, Rex wakes up {{inside of a}} shed, handcuffed to the floor. He tries to dial 911 {{on the cell phone}} but Cooper comes in, interrupting him. Michael speaks to Nancy, who admits that she helped Cooper escape but didn’t know he would abduct anyone. She claims that she helped him because he claimed that he was innocent. Tara notes that Cooper had phoned Tara, and told him to go to a payphone near his police station. He goes there, and speaks to Cooper, who tells him to meet him at a warehouse. Cooper then apologizes to Rex, stating that [...] "no son should pay for the sins of the fathers", and walks out of the shack. Michael meets with him; he claims that he met him for [...] "justice", and said that he was innocent. Cooper explains that Rex will die without him, confirming that he will die from dehydration possibly soon. He goes home and takes a sleeping pill, transferring to the [...] "red reality". Later, in the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah is alive and Rex isn't), he speaks with Cooper at jail. He says that he didn't do it, and asks if <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> did. He claimed that Jim Mayhew, another cop, committed the crime and framed him.|$|E
2500|$|The midwife {{urgently}} commandeers {{a bicycle}} from the schoolteacher {{to go to}} the police in town, claiming that her son has said <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> attacked him. She and her son are not seen again; meanwhile the doctor and his family have also suddenly disappeared, leaving a note on the door indicating his practice is closed. The schoolteacher's growing suspicions lead to a confrontation in the pastor's rectory, where he suggests that the pastor's children and students had prior knowledge of the local troubles and insinuates that they likely perpetrated them. [...] Offended, the pastor berates him and threatens to report him to the authorities if he repeats his accusations.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 July 2011 it was {{reported}} that Eddie would become the target of an arson attack when he sets up new premises for his antiques business, but his entire stock is destroyed by fire, and Eddie will blame Michael for it. A source from the series said, [...] "This is a really dramatic plot for David. He can really get his teeth into it. Despite being an Albert Square regular for only a few weeks, he has already started to establish himself {{as one of the most}} popular characters in the show. [...] Eddie will be seen celebrating with his boys when suddenly he sees his stock go up in flames. [...] He is determined <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> is to blame—but is he right?" ...|$|E
