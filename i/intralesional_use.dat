40|$|<b>Intralesional</b> <b>use</b> of {{cidofovir}} (Vistide(®)) {{has been}} one of the mainstays of adjuvant therapy in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) since 1998. In 2011, a communication provided by the producer of cidofovir addressed very serious side effects concerning its off-label use. As this was a general warning, it was inconclusive whether this would account for its use in RRP. The aim of this study is to determine whether nephrotoxic, neutropenic, or oncogenic side effects have occurred after <b>intralesional</b> <b>use</b> of cidofovir in patients with RRP. Update of recent developments in RRP, a multicentre questionnaire and a multicentre retrospective chart review. Sixteen hospitals from eleven countries worldwide submitted records of 635 RRP patients, of whom 275 were treated with cidofovir. RRP patients received a median of three intralesional injections (interquartile range 2 - 6). There were no statistical differences in occurrence of neutropenia or renal dysfunction before and after cidofovir. There was no statistical difference in occurrence of upper airway and tracheal malignancies between the cidofovir and the non-cidofovir group.

The number of previous RRP debulking procedures ranged from 1 to 100. The intensity of papillomatosis differed from one anatomic site and moderate growth to four or five localizations with heavy extension. The number of injections per patient varied from 1 to 7, and the total volume of 5  mg/ml solution varied from 2 to 33  ml. The injections were combined with laser debulking of the lesions. In disperse papillomata, the injections were administered in particular anatomical sites in 4 – 6  weeks intervals, in massive lesions injections were repeated in the same anatomical site in 2 – 4  weeks. Complete remission was observed in 18 out of 32 patients. 13 patients showed remission in a place of cidofovir injection. One patient did not react to the drug. In four patients, new changes in injection places appeared. In two patients, hepatic toxic side effects were observed.

30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of anti-fibrotic {{agents in the}} treatment of muscle injuries has been studied solely in animal models. These studies have focused on reducing the post-traumatic formation of fibrosis by improving the remodelling process (Evans 2013; Garg et al. 2015; Kelc et al. 2015; Terada et al. 2013). Approaches based on stem cell therapies, which describe the <b>intralesional</b> <b>use</b> of various progenitor cells—particularly in combination with extracellular scaffolds (Tissue Engineered Muscle Construct, TEMC)—are based on experimental approaches in animal models (Sicari et al. 2014). The application of acellular scaffolds is thought to optimize the rupture by improving the migration of satellite cells (Sicari et al. 2014). In view of the given anti-doping restrictions, which prohibit the injection of growth factors (Prohibited Substances S 2) and the use of normal and modified genetic cells (Prohibited Methods M 3), (WADA 2018) a comprehensive review of this topic has been excluded from this manuscript. It is still unknown to what degree Vitamin D contributes to the healing process or the occurrence of muscle injuries in the first place. Some studies support the potentially beneficial effects of using Vitamin D in muscle injuries; they show a correlation between Vitamin D and muscular function with respect to muscle strength and physical performance (Ceglia 2008; Hildebrand et al. 2016; Pfeifer et al. 2002). However, there is currently no scientific rationale for the comprehensive ingestion of Vitamin D.

The effectiveness of this therapy can be increased with ultrasound, but the optimal conditions are not yet clearly established. Using a novel in vitro system of blood clots previously developed by our group, we investigated various parameters of <b>intralesional</b> sonothrombolysis <b>using</b> an endosonography catheter in combination with rtPA. Standardized human blood clots were equipped with a drainage catheter and weighed before and after 4 treatments: control (drainage only), rtPA only, ultrasound only and the combination of rtPA+ultrasound. The effectiveness of ultrasound was further analysed in terms of optimal frequency, duration and distance to the probe. Temperature and acoustic peak rarefaction pressure (APRP) were assessed to analyse potential adverse effects and quantify lysis. Histo-morphological analysis of the treated clots was performed by H&E staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescent fibrinogen. The combined treatment rtPA+ultrasound achieved the highest lysis rates with a relative weight of 30. 3 %± 5. 5 % (p≤ 0. 0001) compared to all other groups. Similar results were observed when treating aged clots. Confocal fluorescent microscopy of the treated clots revealed a rarefied fibrin mesh without cavitations.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{outlines}} {{the ability of}} MR imaging in staging, grading, tissue characterization, and posttherapeutic surveillance of soft tissue tumors. Well-known staging parameters, such as extent, relationship with adjacent structures, and detection of <b>intralesional</b> necrosis, are <b>used</b> in the MR protocol for locoregional staging.

The role of MR imaging is to afford recognition of these lesions that need further aggressive work-up, excluding all others. Despite controversial reports, the definite role of MR imaging in grading of soft tissue tumors seems to become established. As for grading, a lot of individual imaging characteristics used for tissue characterization have low sensitivity, but combinations of parameters (age, site, signal intensities) are more useful and often allow to predict a specific diagnosis or to narrow {{down the list of}} differential diagnoses.

40|$|Study Design: A restrospective {{review of}} 81 cases of osteoid osteoma of the mobile spine {{submitted}} to surgical treatment. Objective: Analyze pro and contras of different techniques (conventional and minimally invasive) {{for the treatment}} of osteoid osteoma. Summary of Background Data: Intralesional excision has been considered the standard treatment for spinal osteoid osteoma. The high success rate of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of a variety of spinal disorders lead us to believe this technique can also be applicable {{for the treatment of}} osteoid osteoma of the spine. Methods: Eighty-one patients affected by osteoid osteoma were consecutively treated by the same team with <b>intralesional</b> excision <b>using</b> conventional or minimally invasive approach by video-assisted endoscopy, microscope, or percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation. The clinical features, the radiologic findings, and the outcome were reviewed. Pain and neurologic symptoms, were scored before surgery, after surgery and at the follow-up. Complications and local recurrences were also recorded. Results: Immediate relief of pain was observed after surgery in all patients. One patient showed mild neurologic impairment before treatment but became free of neurologic symptoms postoperative. Five local recurrences were found in four patients, always associated with pain. Three of these patients underwent surgery for a second time and one patient for a third time. There were two complications because surgery in two patients. One patient developed a pneumothorax, the other a hematoma. No related cases of kyphosis or scoliosis surgery were observed. Conclusion: Conventional excision therapy is a effective and reliable treatment for osteoid osteoma associated to low morbidity and low local recurrence rate. Minimally invasive surgery is emerging as an alternative method, reducing soft tissue trauma and the collateral damage caused by traditional surgical approach, allow patients a more rapid and complete return to normal function. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

The regions where the sarcoids were most prevalent were those persistently affected {{since the start of}} the disease, namely her left flank/inguinal region, and her right axilla. Smaller, individual, fibroblastic sarcoids were present on her pectoral region, and above her right eye. Under general anesthesia, the exuberant components of most lesions were sharply removed. Following debulking, <b>intralesional</b> chemotherapy <b>using</b> cisplatin and carboplatin in a lipid emulsion was also performed. The patient was recovered without incident. Prior to this surgery, the mare had been treated at CUHA and by local veterinarians with a variety of medications and procedures including cautery, various immunotherapies, autogenous vaccines, intralesional and systemic chemotherapy, and 5 other debulking surgeries. Her history of equine sarcoid began in 2001, when a small, flat (occult) sarcoid was found on her left flank. No treatment was instituted at that time. However, after a hock injury in 2002 that left the mare on stall rest for a year, the sarcoid quickly became more aggressive. It soon became clear that this was not an ordinary case of equine sarcoid, as the tumors spread to other areas of the body to include the right axilla and right ear base. The tumors grew very rapidly as they spread, and began to transition quickly from occult to malevolent sarcoids.

In the former, ILP is performed for a deep layer lesion and transmucosal irradiation with multiple spots fashioned using a single pulse is added for the superficial layer in the same session, to increase the efficacy of regression. In the latter, the lesion is divided by virtual compartment and each area will be sequentially treated by ILP. The irradiated area and total energy in a session should be limited to avoid severe reactions and excessive thermal destruction of surrounding tissue. All treatment outcomes by each technique were satisfactory without serious complications, such as deep ulcer formation, bleeding, or severe swelling developing obstruction.

This retrospective study reviewed the experience of a Brazilian leishmaniasis reference centre <b>using</b> <b>intralesional</b> MA to treat 31 patients over five years (2008 and 2013). The median age was 63 years (22 - 86) and the median duration time of the lesions up to treatment was 16 weeks. In 22 patients (71 %), intralesional therapy was indicated due to the presence of contraindications or previous serious adverse events with systemic MA. Other indications were failure of systemic therapy or ease of administration. Intralesional treatment consisted of one-six infiltrations (median three) for a period of up to 12 weeks. The initial (three months) and definitive (six months) cure rates were 70. 9 % and 67. 7 %, respectively.

The patients were assessed clinically and radiologically according to a predefined protocol, {{with a series of}} plain radiographs, and a functional assessment in accordance with the Enneking functional score. Results: The average age at the time of diagnosis was 14 years and 4 months. The most frequent location affected was the distal femoral epiphysis (75 %), followed by the proximal tibial epiphysis (16. 6 %) and the calcaneus (8. 4 %). There was higher prevalence among the female patients than among the male patients (3 : 1). In three cases, preoperative biopsy was necessary. During the follow-up, {{there was no evidence of}} local tumor recurrence, and all the patients presented an excellent functional result from the surgical technique used, with Enneking scores ranging from 20 to 30. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of chondroblastoma, <b>using</b> <b>intralesional</b> resection, adjuvant electrocauterization and replacement with methyl methacrylate or bone graft produced good results...|$|R
40|$|Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is an {{inflammatory}} disease {{that results in}} abscesses, keloids, and fistulas.   Acne inversa is likely to result from aberrant cellular immunity and dysfunction of the hair follicle in which coagulase negative staphylococcus (CONS) and perhaps other bacteria appear e. g Corynebacterium sp. {{to play a role}} by creating biofilms and stimulating the immune system.  One treatment that has been proposed for HS is photodynamic therapy.  The cases series reported are small and not double blinded. As of October of 2104, 8 articles with 64 patients report success with photodynamic therapy using 5 -aminolevulinic acid (PDT-ALA) or its methyl ester (PDT-MAL).   One of these 8 reports noted superiority of the free methylene blue gel over niosomal methylene blue gel.   Another report described success in a 27 -patient trial <b>using</b> <b>intralesional</b> 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in saline at a concentration of 1 %.  This was administered at a dose of 0. 2 ml per cm 3 and an HS fistula was irradiated by a continuous 630 -nm laser diode through a 1 -mm thick optical fiber to 1 Watt per cm 3 for 3 minutes (180 Joules).  However, 3 articles reported failure with PDT-ALA or pulse dye laser-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDL-PDT) and one article note 1 failure and 1 success.  We suggest that it is the ability of PDT-ALA or PDT-MAL to break up the bio-film produced by CONS and other antibacterial effects that account for its success in treating HS in patients in whom bio-film plays a pivotal part of their pathogenesis.  Other effects are also possible as well.   Other mechanisms by which PDT may improve HS include cytotoxic effects, which cause selective cell necrosis, and immunomodulatory effects.   The data suggests that if PDT is to be used, it should be with MAL or intralesional ALA. Note that {{there are a variety of}} causes of HS. These include hyperkeratosis of in the follicular infundibulum, aberrant cellular immunity, down regulations of defensins in stage III HS, and the infiltration of neutrophils, mast cells, plasma cells, and lymphocytes into the affected follicle, among others.   However, it is likely that in individual cases one cause is primary and others secondary.   In conclusion, PDT is not a first line treatment for HS but in some cases could be added as an adjuvant to therapies such as clindamycin and rifampin...|$|R

MÉTODOS: Foi realizado estudo retrospectivo de 12 pacientes com diagnóstico histológico de condroblastoma, atendidos entre 2003 e 2009, na Fundação Pio XII (Hospital de Câncer de Barretos - Barretos, SP) e submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico com ressecção intralesional, adjuvância com eletrocauterização e substituição por metilmetacrilato (11 casos) ou enxerto ósseo autólogo de crista ilíaca (um caso). A avaliação pré-operatória incluía exame físico, radiografias simples do local, ressonância nuclear magnética ou tomografia axial computadorizada local, além de cintilografia óssea. Os pacientes foram avaliados clínica e radiologicamente, segundo protocolo predefinido, com radiografias seriadas e avaliação funcional, {{conforme}} o escore funcional de Enneking. RESULTADOS: A idade média do diagnóstico foi de 14 A e 4 M, sendo o local preferencial de acometimento a epífise distal do fêmur (75 %), seguido pela tíbia proximal (16, 6 %) e calcâneo (8, 4 %). Houve prevalência maior no sexo masculino em relação ao sexo feminino (3 : 1). Em três casos houve necessidade prévia de biópsia. Durante o seguimento, não evidenciamos recidiva local do tumor e todos os pacientes apresentaram excelente resultado funcional, com escore de Enneking entre 20 e 30, com a técnica cirúrgica empregada. CONCLUSÃO: O tratamento cirúrgico do condroblastoma, com ressecção intralesional, uso de adjuvância, com eletrocauterização e substituição por metilmetacrilato ou enxerto ósseo produz bons resultados.
