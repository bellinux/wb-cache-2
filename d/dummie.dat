40|$|Using a fixed-effects panel data approach, FDI {{flows of}} 22 OECD {{countries}} are explained by gravity equations {{over the period}} 1991 - 2001. It is distinguished between all available observations, Intra-EU 25 observations only, and observations not belonging to the EU 25 area {{in order to control}} for EU-specific effects. Regressions are repeated with exports as dependent variable in order to capture diverging influences for trade flows. Changes in total market size and relative market size are important factors that lead both FDI and exports in the same direction. However, relative market size is only significant in the FDI equation when variation between the EU 25 area and other investment is taken into account, thus indicating a concentration of FDI within Western and Central Europe. Stock market booms boost FDI but not exports. Differences in significance levels/signs of coefficients of political indicators and exchange rate changes indicate that exports are demand-driven while FDI is supply-driven.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{organized}} {{a training program}} for oral fiber optic intubation (FOI) under conscious sedation. The efficacy {{of the program was}} evaluated by comparing the performances of experts and novices. METHODS: The training procedure was divided into two sessions: a theoretical session on difficult airways, the fiber optic bronchoscope (FOB), remifentanil, topical anesthesia and patient interactions; and a session involving simulations of the FOI technique on dummies. For in vivo FOI, we enrolled patients requiring orotracheal intubation for elective surgery. Electrocardiograms, mean arterial pressure was railroaded over the fiberscope, and tracheal intubati 6 and 7) FOIs, respectively, joined the study. To reach ± 23 bpm, P= 0. 02), and RR was decreased (from 16 ± 3 to 12 ± 4 bpm, P< 0. 05). No differences were recorded between the experts and less-experienced anesthesiologists. The average duration of FOI was 3. 3 ± 2. 0 min for experts and 4. 2 ± 2. 4 min for novices (P= 0. 03). Procedures were successful in both groups, with patients in each group being equally satisfied with the procedures. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of a structured FOI training program, demonstrating {{that it is possible to}} learn to perform FOI proficiently by practicing on <b>dummie...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sten Jonsson {{wants to}} start a {{production}} of an advertising catalogue for small companies in Sweden. Acatalogue where the advertisingcost is so low {{that most of the}} companies can afford to participate. Thecompanies who will advertise should be manufacturing companies in trades of carpentry, sheet metalworkshops, forging workshops and engineering workshops. The catalogue will facilitate for the manufacturer to reach the costumer without any middleman. Without a middleman creates a possibility for an opinion about the product {{at the same time as}} theprice can be held low. A catalogue of this type would benefit the marketing of the companies at the sametime as it would generate an occasion for innovations. The possible target groups are property companies, construct companies and farmers. A market research has been carried out contained a postal interview and a phone interview. Themarket research carried out to get an understanding in what the companies think about the idea butalso to see if the companies are in interest of advertise in the catalogue. Unfortunately the marketresearch became unusable when only three of thirty companies comment the idea and two of themwanted to meet for a further visit. In relation to the market research a deeper study in market research,in which essential parts for the project, was made. A <b>dummie</b> has been done to show the design of the catalogue. A calculation has also been done to get an understanding in what the project would cost to start...|$|E
