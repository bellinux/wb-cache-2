Ammonia refrigeration is also used in large industrial applications, where its efficiency more than compensates for the higher initial cost, and associated risk.

50|$|As a consequence, growth-oriented {{environmental}} economists propose {{government intervention}} into switching {{sources of energy}} production, favouring wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear. This would largely confine use of fossil fuels to either domestic cooking needs (such as for <b>kerosene</b> <b>burners)</b> or where {{carbon capture and storage}} technology can be cost-effective and reliable. The Stern Review, published by the United Kingdom Government in 2006, concluded that an investment of 1% of GDP (later changed to 2%) would be sufficient to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and that failure to do so could risk climate-related costs equal to 20% of GDP. Because carbon capture and storage is as yet widely unproven, and its long term effectiveness (such as in containing carbon dioxide 'leaks') unknown, and because of current costs of alternative fuels, these policy responses largely rest on faith of technological change.|$|R

A 2nd Order optic was mounted on a roller carriage to allow for smooth rotation. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the lens).

40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} within this task was {{to address the issue}} of the effect of the fuel phase on soot {{formation}} in the specific situation of a swirl combustor. The experiments were therefore to be performed in an environment resembling real aeroengine conditions as close as possible. In a complex flow field prevailing in an aeroengine combustor, the size and location of fuel-rich regions as sources of soot depend on fuel placement and mixing in the case of a gaseous fuel. For a liquid fuel, additional processes like atomization, dispersion and evaporation act on the fuel. Each one of these processes adds an individual time constant to the formation of fuel-rich soot-forming regions, depending air-to-fuel ratio (AFR), temperature, pressure, and pressure drop across the injector. Atomization and dispersion also influence the mixing and formation of fuel rich regions directly. In combination with the flow field characteristics, both the amount of soot formed and the regions of soot formation may vary. Therefore, it has to be expected that the soot formation process depends on the operating parameters as well as on the geometric features of the injector in a different way for gaseous and liquid fuel. It was intended to study the influence of operating conditions separately from flow field and fuel composition effects. Consequently, two sets of experiments were performed with two burners running on liquid and prevaporized <b>kerosene,</b> respectively. The <b>burners</b> were chosen with respect to a maximum possible similarity in terms of size, fuel placement, and internal aerodynamics. Tests with both burners were performed for a set of identical operating conditions. Pressure, air preheat temperature, AFR and pressure drop across the burner were varied to study the effect of these parameters for both fuel phases. In an initial screening campaign during which the effect of parameter variation was observed qualitatively using video recordings and extracted still images, the accessible parameter range and interesting operating points were identified. In a second stage, soot volume fractions were measured qualitatively for the relevant operating conditions using laser-induced incandescence (LII). This technique allows the spatially resolved measurement of soot concentrations in a plane through the combustor. Both measurements of instantaneous and time-averaged distributions are possible. A comprehensive discussion of the method and its applications can be found in [Sch 06] and references therein. Video and LII investigations require a test rig and combustor with a large optical access to the primary zone, which provides realistic operating conditions as well. ...|$|R

50|$|Early Stanley {{cars had}} light wooden bodies mounted on tubular steel frames {{by means of}} full-elliptic springs. Steam was {{generated}} in a vertical fire-tube boiler, mounted beneath the seat, with a vaporizing gasoline (later, <b>kerosene)</b> <b>burner</b> underneath. The boiler was reinforced by several layers of piano wire wound around it, which gave it a strong but relatively light-weight shell. In early models, the vertical fire-tubes were made of copper, and were expanded into holes in {{the upper and lower}} crown sheets. In later models, the installation of a condenser caused oil-fouling in the expansion joints, and welded steel fire-tubes had to used. The boilers were reasonably safe, since they were fitted with safety valves. Even if these failed, any dangerous over pressure would rupture one of the joints long before the boiler shell itself could burst. The resulting leakage would relieve the boiler pressure and douse the burner, with very little risk to the passenger. There is not a single documented incident of a Stanley boiler exploding.|$|E

40|$|Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are {{ubiquitous}} {{organic compounds}} widely {{found in all}} environmental compartments. The main concern of PAHs {{is that some of}} them are reported to have carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. In the atmosphere, they are mainly emitted as by-products of organic matter and fossil fuel incomplete combustion such as, domestic heating, automobile fuel combustion, wood burning and other industrial processes. Once released into the atmosphere, they are present on both gaseous and particulate phases and may be submitted to photodegradation and/or chemical oxidation by O 3, OH or NOx. In order to differentiate and apportion PAH sources, several approaches of source assessment are proposed in the literature like, for instance, the molecular PAH concentration ratios. Recently, the use of 13 C molecular isotopic composition has been developed to improve the molecular approach, commonly used to characterize atmospheric particulate-PAH sources. The first step of the method consists in measuring the 13 C/ 12 C isotopic composition of particulate PAHs from specific sampling sites (urban, rural, traffic), well characterized emissions (ship soot, <b>kerosene</b> <b>burner,</b> coal fly ash [...] .) or reference materials (urban dust, diesel soot). It is important, in a second step, to check the influence of atmospheric physico-chemical processes on the PAH isotopic composition values such as the heterogeneous reactivity with atmospheric oxidants, photolysis and particle transport.
