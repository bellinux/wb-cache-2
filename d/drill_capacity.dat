40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the failure and ejection behavior of concrete materials under internal blast, the default Riedel-Hiermaier-Thoma (RHT) concrete model in AUTODYN and a meshfree processor called SPH are employed in this numerical simulation. It is shown that the failure mechanisms are significantly different in these damaged zones. Crushed zone is caused by shear failure while fractured zone is induced by tensile failure, and spalled zone is formed {{by a combination of}} shear and tensile failure. In addition, the ejection velocity distribution of the fragmented concrete mass on free surface is examined. The results indicate that the ejection velocity declines monotonously with the increase of the distance to symmetry axis of computational model. On the wall of the prefabricated borehole, two types of fragmented concrete mass are analyzed, and bottom initiation is recommended to eject the fragmented concrete mass effectively. Moreover, an algorithm of average ejection speed is developed to effectively estimate the <b>drill</b> <b>capacity</b> of high velocity, energetic (HE) projectiles. At last, the validity of numerical simulation is verified by physical experiments...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{possibility}} for a full mud return, top hole drilling system, applying a concentric dual drill string and an integrated pump. Top holes are usually drilled without mud return, leaving the cuttings on the sea floor. Sea water with barite and other additives are employed as drilling fluid and is released to the sea when used. By employing a dual drill string and a down hole pump to lift the return to top side facilities, full return is enabled. This facilitates the use of high performance mud, which have several advantages, including primary well control before the BOP is set, improved hole stability, elimination of a pilot hole to check for shallow gas influx and extended top hole sections. Possible solutions to obtain a complete and functioning new system have been analyzed. Based on existing technology and its current limitations, two alternative systems are developed on a conceptual level. The first system includes one integrated return pump, the second employs multiple integrated return pumps. The design base case is set to 1000 meter water depth and 500 meter deep well, of which 100 meter is drilled with a 36 ” drill bit, and 400 meter is drilled with a 26 ” drill bit. This base case covers most of the top holes drilled on the Norwegian sector. System pressure estimates are presented, and a mud level regulation solution is developed and analyzed. The mud level regulation system allows the mud level in the well to be controlled to keep the well balanced and stabilized, and to prevent mud discharges to sea floor. The level regulation solution is theoretically proved, and enables reliable regulation of the mud level in the well based on existing technology. Predictions of the system behavior are made, and {{the limitations of the}} systems are presented. The developed systems <b>drilling</b> <b>capacities</b> are analyzed and found not capable of fulfilling the base case requirements, due to the limitations of the selected dual drill pipe. The low flow rate of the pipe limits the ROP, due to high cutting generation with large drill bit diameters. The hydraulic horsepowers at the drill bit nozzles are also too low, due to the lowered available pressure drop, low flow rate, and large drill bit. However, the available pressure drop at the drill bit nozzles are estimated to over 80 bar. It is recommended to employ a larger dual drill pipe, with increased pressure <b>capacity.</b> Then the <b>drilling</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system would be comparable to other full return top hole drilling systems. The systems impact on cost and drilling parameters are discussed and found to be comparable with other innovative solutions for full return top hole drilling. There are uncertainties of both developed systems. The uncertainties regarding the system employing only one return pump concerns the design limitations of the chosen return pump type, a progressive cavity pump. The uncertainties regarding the multiple return pump system, concerns the system behavior with several return pumps distributed throughout the drill string. A full return top hole drilling system employing a concentric dual drill string and an integrated pump is found feasible. But due to existing technology limitations, a mud motor is chosen to power the return pump, this demands a drill pipe with a higher capacity than what exists today, to obtain comparable <b>drilling</b> <b>capacity</b> to other top hole drilling systems. The development of an electric conducting dual drill pipe would expand the possibilities much further, and improve the overall <b>drilling</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system...|$|R

However, technical barriers {{still have to be}} addressed for those reductions to provide savings on installation costs. The coaxial GHEs with a borehole diameter of 203.2  mm (8 in.) showed most advantages associated with borehole thermal resistance and heat storage <b>capacity.</b> Commercial <b>drilling</b> <b>capacity</b> available in North America may need to accommodate larger boreholes for coaxial GHEs to be installed at competitive cost. Assembling HDPE pipes with a large diameter can complicate the installation process because large pipes are commonly shipped in sections to be joined with fusion tools in the field. The double U-pipe GHEs were shown to provide slightly smaller but similar advantages for the total borehole length reduction (up to 20 %), especially when considering thermally enhanced pipe and deeper boreholes. While efficient technology to install coaxial GHEs may not be available at the moment, installation of double U-pipe GHE can be achieved with current tools and expertise. The drilling depth is an important factor for balancing flow rate of both double U-pipe and coaxial GHEs. Determining the depth at which this practice remains economical would require further research. In any cases, the thermally enhanced pipe was shown to be an asset for the alternative GHE configurations studied.|$|R

A series of joint ventures between state oil company Rosneft and various IOCs offshore in the Arctic has caused much excitement in this regard, but the potential of Russia’s unconventional oil resources might provide a shorter term reason to be optimistic. Russia has the largest estimated shale oil resources in the world, with a particular focus on the Bazhenov layer, and this report analyses the oil company work that has been done to date to assess the real potential of this resource and also assesses the potential impact of tax changes that have been introduced to encourage investment activity. It concludes that although the resource base would appear to be enormous, a number of below and above ground issues remain which mean that government targets of 1 mmbpd of production win a decade are unlikely to be met.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of percussive drill monitoring in the mining and underground construction industries. The technique {{has been used to}} provide information on different ground properties and conditions and for drill productivity evaluation. Five different test sites have been used: the OSCAR area in the Kiirunavaara magnetite mine in Kiruna, the Viscaria copper mine in Kiruna, the Zinkgruvan mine in south-central Sweden, the Glödberget tunneling site in Västerbotten county and the Hallandsåsen tunneling site in southern Sweden. A methodology has been suggested and tested for treatment of raw data in order to extract rock dependent parameter variations from variations generated by the drill system itself and other external influences. Prediction of rock hardness and fracturing can be done without initial calibration, providing a good foundation for interpretation by site personnel. The mining applications show that drill monitoring has a very high potential for ore boundary delineation and also for classification of existing rock types. In tunneling applications drill monitoring demonstrates a good capability of foreseeing rock conditions ahead of the tunnel face. Other benefits are the speed of the method, its practicality {{and the fact that it}} requires no additional equipment, time or access to the production front. The potential for detailed drill productivity evaluation by drill monitoring has been demonstrated.

Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) designers currently follow American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) design methods for design of drilled shafts in shale and other weak rock.

However, shale and other weak rock can be notoriously difficult to effectively sample and test, which poses practical problems for those tasked with designing drilled shafts in such materials.

In order to utilize results of in-situ tests for design of drilled shafts using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), it is necessary to correlate in-situ test measurements with side and tip resistance and to establish calibrated resistance factors that account for the reliability of the correlations and the in-situ test measurements.

40|$|Polar {{sciences}} are {{a modern}} {{branch of the}} natural sciences involving large groups of researchers, and sophisticated instrumentation contributing indispensable data for {{a better understanding of the}} polar regions and their impact on the global environment. The fact that a lot of the necessary data can only be collected by dedicated research vessels, from permanently manned stations, or during expeditions involving many different disciplines and substantial logistic efforts, has resulted in complex and expensive interdisciplinary experiments. These can only be effectively coordinated within the framework of close international cooperation. The ERICON Science Perspective addresses the entire polar marine scientific community that requires a research vessel for carrying out their field and sea work throughout all seasons of the year. It also addresses the community that needs a deep-sea drilling facility, which would use the research platform, mainly during the summer months, to study the structure and properties of the oceanic crust and the history of the oceanic depositional environments in polar regions. Deep-sea drilling has only been done once in the ice-infested waters of the central Arctic during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) 302, aka, ACEX Coring Expedition. Around Antarctica substantial progress has been achieved by using the drilling platforms of the Deep-Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and the IODP, during the ice-free seasons, and by using a drill rig from the land fast sea ice very close to shore on the Cape Roberts Project (CRP), and from the ice shelf in the ANtarctic geological DRILLing project (ANDRILL). However, in Antarctica, neither the CRP-tools nor the conventional drilling vessels, which cannot enter iceinfested waters, are able to cover all desirable drilling locations. So far, mainly due to the lack of a suitable ice-capable drilling platform, it has not been possible to investigate many of these locations. These scientific targets will now receive renewed attention in this report (cf. Chapters 3 and 4). The ERICON scientific program focuses on the research disciplines and activities that require a platform with the unique capability of year-round operations in the central Arctic and Antarctic ice infested waters. This document is organized in six chapters. Chapters 1 to 5 are dedicated to five major Scientific Core Topics, each encompassing a number of high-priority key questions embracing the most important scientific challenges that should be targeted in the next fifteen years. Chapter 6 focuses on the technological requirements needed to successfully answer these scientific questions. The managerial, financial, and organizational structures for building and managing the vessel, as well as the technical designs of the research platform, are not included in the present document, but they have been elaborated on within the EU FP 7 funded EUROPEAN ICEBREAKER CONSORTIUM “AURORA BOREALIS” (ERICON-AB) project, of which this Science Perspective is a component. The five research topics, around which this Science Perspective is structured, provide an umbrella under which technological and scientific research needs and strategies can be identified. The key questions proposed in each of the chapters have been intentionally kept general and of a nature that will require a strong effort to fulfil, while allowing shorter-term studies to be undertaken on more specific issues.

This research aims to mediate the bump {{at the end of}} the bridge and to validate the use of post grouting to increase <b>drilled</b> shaft <b>capacity.</b> Performance monitoring and full scale test programs were used to evaluate these technical issues. The bump {{at the end of the}} bridge is typically due to settlement of the approach soils and cracking of the approach pavements. The settlement and cracking in integral abutment bridges are typically dealt with by connecting the approach slab to the integral abutment bridge. Two integral abutment bridges with integrally connected precast approach slabs were evaluated using long-term monitoring systems to study their structural performance and determine the range of forces that should be considered when designing such approach slabs. This study has identified design and construction considerations for integrally connected precast approach slabs. The approach slab study revealed the source and magnitude of forces to be considered in the design and construction of approach slabs integrally connected to integral abutment bridges. Consideration of these forces in the design and construction of such approach slabs could potentially lead to reduced maintenance costs associated with the bump at the end of the bridge. The required deep embedment length of drilled shafts is due to the inability to fully mobilize the end bearing resistance of the shaft before reaching service displacement criteria. Post grouting of drilled shafts can be used to effectively increase the end bearing capacity within service displacement limits, often times allowing the drilled shaft to be shortened without sacrificing capacity. Through a load test program and long-term performance monitoring of production shafts, the increase in capacity and performance of post grouted drilled shafts were investigated. This study has identified design and construction considerations for post grouted drilled shafts. The post grouted drilled shaft study verified the use of post grouting as a technique for increasing the end bearing resistance of drilled shafts and also identified design and construction considerations for post grouted drilled shafts. Increasing the end bearing resistance of drilled shafts through the use of post grouting can effectively allow the shafts to be shortened without losing capacity or exceeding service displacement criteria; potentially leading to reduced costs for bridge projects...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{topic of}} the {{following}} project {{is devoted to the}} theme of drilling of the ultra-deep wells and in particular to the optimization of the length of dual aluminum-steel drill string as a one of the concept which have been used for drilling of super deep well on Kolskyi peninsula. The mentioned project is the most prominent and successful representative of conducted in formal Soviet Union countries (FSU) program of super-deep scientific drilling in 70 th- 90 th years of the last century. The program of super-deep borehole construction was in many senses a unique long-term field experiment. Several new drilling technologies have been developed at this time. Among them aluminum drill-pipes, gear reduction turbo-drills, coring tools for hard rock drilling, drilling and coring without pulling the drill-pipes (DWPP) in crystalline rocks, vertical drilling technology {{and a number of other}} improvements. Interest of scientists to the composition and structure of the deep zones of the crust is inexhaustible and is always on the agenda. But the possibility of getting the unique scientific and technological data is limited to the actual level of scientific and technical progress. Modern simulators and software products together with experience based engineering approach allows us to consider in more detail the calculation of loads on the drill string and take into account a number of relevant factors. A suchlike working mechanism was not available to engineers thirty years ago and the work was generally based on intuitive knowledge and experience of the scientists and engineering community. Outcome of the conducted project on Kolskyi peninsula was outstanding not only as a result for geological and geophysical areas, but also as an outcome in commercial drilling engineering. It gave an impulse for the further drilling technology development and played the role in the oil and gas drilling technology upgrading. Important to notice, that aluminium high strength drill-pipes was developed at this time and found successful application in offshore riser-less drilling. Aluminium drill-strings become a source of increased interest in the last decade mainly because of the hidden potentials for extended reach and horizontal drilling applications and improved <b>drill</b> rig <b>capacity.</b> The issue of drilling of ultra-deep wells will increase in the future also due to normal growing interest of engineering community to drill an unreachable depth and to gain new high technological results. The topic may be of interest also for the wide range of companies involved in the development of reservoirs with extended reach depth...|$|R
40|$|The current design {{methodology}} for a drilled shaft foundation in cohesionless soil is primarily based on ultimate skin friction values of drilled shafts. In {{order to obtain}} these values for each soil type, load tests such as Osterberg test are designed and performed. The Osterberg test layout is designed to estimate the <b>capacity</b> of <b>drilled</b> shaft by applying an upward load during the test and then calculating the downward capacity assuming the upward and downward capacity are the same. This method is appropriate for soils not containing caliche layers because caliche layers bond to the shaft and prevent skin friction to reach its ultimate capacity during the load test. As long as ultimate skin friction is achieved, the location of O-cell with respect to any of existing soil layers is not an effective. Osterberg test results in soils containing caliche indicate that the ultimate skin friction is not achieved and shaft/caliche interaction is mostly elastic. In these cases, {{the behavior of the}} shaft when it is loaded from the bottom is different from when it is loaded from the top. This study will show that, the location of O-cell with respect to the caliche layers will influence the interpretation of test results. The study will investigate the current interpretation method when O-cell is installed at a location far from caliche and will compare the equivalent top-down load from test results to when the shaft is loaded from the top. The reason for discrepancies between the behavior of the shaft in these two loading scenario will be explained. Additionally, the interpretation for tests when O-cell is installed close to caliche will be investigated and the behavior of the shaft will be compared for upward and downward loading. The procedure is performed by collecting 30 Osterberg load tests in soils containing caliche. The test layouts with O-cell installed at identified locations are selected. The 2 -D finite element software PLAXIS 8 is then used to simulate the Osterberg tests. The models are calibrated using field Osterberg tests and then loaded conventionally from the top. The behavior of the shaft during top-down loading is compared to interpreted test results from Osterberg test. A test layout with O-cell at a location far from the caliche layers shown to have a higher capacity during conventional loading compared to interpreted test results from Osterberg load test. On the other hand when O-cell is installed close to caliche, the top-down loading shows a similar behavior to interpreted test results from Osterberg load test. In fact when O-cell and caliche layers are close to each other, the test layout is similar to the procedure performed to estimate rock socketed <b>drilled</b> shafts <b>capacity.</b> The results of this study will help engineers to have better understanding of the drilled shafts behavior in soils containing caliche by introducing an appropriate test design and interpretation of the test results...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} from September 21, 1982 to November 1, 1982 one {{geothermal}} test well was drilled within the Baltazor Hot Springs KGRA in northwestern Nevada to a total depth of 2529 feet (Figure 1). Temperature-depth profiles from two temperature surveys run in the open hole are presented in Figure 2. The maximum temperature recorded was 223. 77 F at a total survey depth of 2430 feet. Geothermal gradients from selected intervals in the well ranged from 2. 25 F/ 100 ft to 11. 00 F/ 100 ft. Individual temperature-depth plots, gradient plots, and interval gradient plots are provided in Appendix A. Rock types encountered ranged from unconsolidated alluvium to rhyolitic and basaltic flows, tuffs and flow breccias. A lithologic section for the well is provided in a pocket {{at the back of}} the report (Figure 3). Thermal conductivity measurements were performed on a total of 26 drill cutting samples that ranged from 2. 9 TCU to 5. 5 TCU (1 TCU = 1 mcal/cm-sec-deg C) and are presented in Appendix B. Selected heat flow data for the well are provided in Table 1. Well 45 - 14 was drilled by Southwest Drilling and Exploration, Inc., utilizing a Gardner Denver 2000 rotary drilling machine with a 53 foot mast rated at 100, 000 lbs. <b>capacity.</b> <b>Drilling</b> conditions ranged from moderate to difficult with the major problems resulting from the hard and fractured rhyolite sequence in the upper part of the well. Drilling rates below 1750 feet were greatly reduced as a result of decreasing the weight on the bit to keep the vertical deviation within the required 4 degrees. Fluid losses were contained to a minimum below the rhyolite sequence and did not present a major problem. Selected drilling data and a detailed drilling history are provided in Appendix C. Earth Power Production Company completed two test holes in the immediate area in June and July 1979. Boreholes BZ 1500 - 1 and BZ 1500 - 2 were drilled to depths of 1543 feet and 1434 feet respectively. Selected temperature-depth plots from these holes are included in Appendix D...|$|R
40|$|There are {{thousands}} of subsea wells in the world. The subsea industry is growing, more and more subsea wells are being developed. When the wells are no longer used, usually because they become unproductive, {{they need to be}} permanently plugged and abandoned (P&A). The regulations order {{the oil and gas industry}} to seal the unused wells to protect the environment. In the next few years, many of those subsea wells are expected to reach their ‘unproductive phase’, which means there will be a considerable number of subsea wells to be abandoned. For the last couple of years, lots of investment has been spent in the development of new technologies dedicated to well P&A. However, the current method of P&A operation is still traditionally performed with the same tools that are used for drilling and completions. This expensive way of operation raises up companies’ costs and the time to P&A a well. The market remains dominated by the use of conventional solutions, such as full <b>capacity</b> <b>drilling</b> rigs. This method indeed makes sure the whole operation can be done safely but it is a less cost-effective solution. Furthermore, P&A activity has no value creation. Therefore, alternatives methods are necessary. One of the alternatives is to use a monohull light well intervention (LWI) vessel, which has a significantly lower cost, to replace the rig for the entire P&A operation. In this thesis, the challenges of performing P&A using LWI vessel are described. Several concepts of solutions are presented, with alternative methods and new technologies that can be used in qualifying LWI vessel P&A operation. There exists a great potential in moving the conventional method from using rig into smaller and cheaper LWI vessel. However, most of the technologies described in this thesis are still in a conceptual stage. Thus, comprehensive qualifications and extensive field trials are needed. The P&A operation utilizing LWI vessel that is discussed in this thesis can be divided into two methods; riserless and riser based method. Presently, the better option for P&A activity using LWI vessel is to use a riser and utilizing coiled tubing for the operation. Modifications of the vessel with some additional equipment might be needed to satisfy the operational requirements. The riserless operation could become the best option after the technology is qualified through considerable field trials. Therefore, companies’ involvement is now needed to test the new technology and to make concrete steps in order to change the mindset of traditional P&A operation...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{agriculture}} {{efficiency and}} the capacity of tools and machinery are crucial. In this work we investigate whether {{it is possible to}} enhance the capacity of sowing by increasing the work speed of seeders, how seed technology affects seed placement, and if there is any difference between two different brands of seeders and their sow techniques. The seeders we have chosen to compare are Väderstad Rapid drill and Amazon Cirrus <b>drill.</b> The tillage <b>capacity</b> of the seeders and their traction power needs were examined as well. Väderstad Rapid and Amazon Cirrus were tested in a randomized block design with four replicates at three different speeds, 8 km/h, 12 km/h and 15 km/h. The seed placement at the different speeds was examined by dividing the seedbed into four different zones from its surface to its bottom. The soil in these zones was thereafter removed and sieved. The kernels were counted in the different zones to investigate if there were any differences between how the seeders placed the seeds at different work speeds. The experiment took place on a farm in southern Sweden, with clay content between 50 - 53 percent. After the sowing process, a soil survey was made in which all loose soil from a test area of 0. 5 m 2 on the seedbed was removed and screened through different sieves to examine the sizes of the aggregates. Possible differences in aggregate size at the three different work speeds were examined as well. The aggregates were then divided into further units; larger than 5 mm, between 2 and 5 mm, and less than 2 mm. The experiment indicates that higher work speed causes slightly higher proportion of aggregates larger than 5 mm in the seedbed, compared to lower work speeds. The proportion of small aggregates is still great enough to maintain a good seedbed. Considering seed placement at different speeds, a significant difference between Väderstad Rapid and Amazon Cirrus seed placement in zone 4 was found. At the different speeds, Väderstad Rapid placed 95 - 98 % in zone 4 compared to Amazon Cirrus with 63 - 82 % in zone 4. Dry weather between the sowing and the emergence calculation gave Väderstad Rapid a better result because it placed a greater number of kernels {{at the bottom of the}} seedbed compared to Amazon Cirrus. A simple test of traction power of the seeders was also made, and the results show that Väderstad Rapid worked considerably more heavy and thus needed more traction power than Amazon Cirrus. In the traction power survey no measuring instruments were used and various tractors were used as well. Because of the method the results could only be a rough valuation as the power of the tractors was not measured exactly. The results of the experiment indicates that when using Väderstad Rapid one can increase the sowing capacity by an increased work speed and still maintain good seed placement. However, there are sufficient of aggregates with a size of 5 mm or smaller in the seedbeds with both Väderstad Rapid and Amazon Cirrus...|$|R
40|$|The British Geological Survey {{has been}} working with WaterAid to improve water {{supplies}} for poor communities in rural Nigeria. Oju and Obi are two adjacent local government areas in Benue State, Nigeria. During the annual dry season (November to April) there is an acute water shortage and much of the population of 300 000 have to rely on unprotected ponds and seepages which are often far from communities. If available, groundwater would offer the safest, easiest and least expensive solution to the water supply problem. The area is underlain by mudstones. Prior to the BGS study, little was known about the potential for finding groundwater in mudstone environments. After a two year study, involving 75 km of geophysical surveys and 54 exploratory boreholes, BGS concluded that sustainable groundwater resources do exist in the mudstone environment of Oju and Obi. Simple geophysical techniques could be used to identify good sites for boreholes or wells, if interpreted carefully. This information could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life of 300 000 people. Communication and partnership were essential aspects of the research. Various organisations had an interest in the outcome of the research. The degree of detail required by the different users varied considerably, so the research had to be effectively communicated in a number of ways. BGS worked closely with WaterAid’s local partner, the Water and Sanitation Unit (WASU) of the local government. Every aspect of the research was discussed with the WASU, from choosing where research sites should be located to designing the form the outputs of the research should take. The partnership was facilitated by several participatory workshops, substantial field training and involvement in the WASU’s weekly planning meetings. Although it was time consuming keeping the WASU fully informed of the methods, rationale and progress of the research, there were many beneficial impacts. Firstly, it meant that the WASU could confidently prepare communities that were used as test sites. Consequently, relations with the local communities were excellent and research activities could proceed rapidly with few misunderstandings. Secondly, the WASU were in a much better position to accept and understand the results of the research, since they were involved in its design. Thirdly, continual dialogue with the WASU kept the research from heading off on tangents that may not have had direct relevance to community water supply. Finally, close co-operation with the WASU meant that the results of the research were communicated in ways that were relevant to their needs and skills, for example in simple maps, visual aids and workshops. Although the WASU are implementing the project at community level, the complexity of the groundwater resources require geologists and engineers to help choose optimum sites for boreholes or wells, and to carry out <b>drilling</b> and testing. <b>Capacity</b> to carry out these surveys is found within the state rural water supply agency (BERWASSA) and within WaterAid. BERWASSA staff were involved in the research process in several ways: BERWASSA staff contributed to the design of the research; two substantial workshops were organised to discuss the findings of the study, and geologists from BERWASSA worked with BGS for several months in the field. Detailed reports and guidelines have been written for BERWASSA to help them to develop the groundwater resources of Oju and Obi. In addition to WASU, BERWASSA and WaterAid, BGS developed relations with several other organisations in the water sector of Nigeria. The difficult hydrogeological conditions encountered in Oju and Obi are found throughout several other states in south-east Nigeria, so there was much interest in the study from water engineers and geologists working in these areas. In response, BGS organised a three day workshop to discuss the results of the investigations in Oju and Obi. Twelve UNICEF water engineers for the Eastern Zone attended, two professors from University of Nigeria Nsukka and two geologists from the Nigerian Geological Survey. Many comparisons were drawn between the experiences of participants in their areas and those found in Oju and Obi...|$|R
