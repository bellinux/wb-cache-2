5|$|Laurie and Irene had one child, Noelene, in January 1940. Wallish {{states that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that Laurie sought to have {{additional}} children but Irene was opposed.|$|E
5|$|The track {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Although many {{thought it was}} catchy, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> to be generic {{when compared to other}} songs played on the radio, and is noted for being a departure from Cheryl's previous works.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the}} cause of the glow was {{lightning}} on Venus. The Soviet Venera 9 and 10 orbiters obtained optical and electromagnetic evidence of lightning on Venus.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> {{that this}} {{inscription}} {{refers to the}} campaigns of governor Gnaeus Julius Verus who dealt with insurrection among the Carvetii tribe of Cumbria c.AD155. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> that this altar indicates emperor worship and devotion to the God Silvanus.|$|R
50|$|Few {{historical}} records exist, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to have <b>been</b> {{owned by a}} William Smith, and {{is known to have}} been present on the first Ordnance Survey map of the region in 1872. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to have <b>been</b> abandoned by 1877.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the}} hamlet was {{so named because}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a common {{settling}} point for Gypsies, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> once <b>thought</b> that Gypsies came from Egypt.|$|R
5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Bat dung, {{a type of}} guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertilizer. During the U.S. Civil War, {{saltpeter}} {{was collected}} from caves to make gunpowder; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that this was bat guano, {{but most of the}} nitrate comes from nitrifying bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.|$|E
5000|$|Shangri-La is a large, dark {{region of}} Saturn's moon Titan at [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> named after Shangri-La, the mythical paradise in Tibet. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> an immense plain of dark material. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> that these regions of Titan were seas, {{but that they}} are now dry.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> {{that if one}} eats sea mustard soup {{on the day of}} an exam, {{one will}} fail the test. Sea mustard <b>is</b> slippery, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> that one will [...] "fall down" [...] and fail. On the other hand, if a person eats sticky rice cake or Korean hard taffy, he or she will pass the exam. Rice cakes and Korean hard taffy <b>are</b> sticky, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to help the person [...] "stick" [...] instead of slip, and thus pass the test.|$|R

5|$|Constantinople and {{neighboring}} provinces also suffered extensive damage. Initially, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that Constantinople, {{the capital of}} the Ottoman Empire, had been completely destroyed. A letter from Petrovaradin described particular devastation in the Galata district, Topkapı Palace, the Hagia Sophia and the Edirne bazaar. The main shock and subsequent aftershocks lasted up to 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> {{to overlap}} with myofibroma.|$|R
5000|$|Fibroblast stimulation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> that {{fibroblast}} stimulation by {{the thyroid}} stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor increases the deposition of glycosaminoglycan, which results in an osmotic edema and fluid retention. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> that many cells responsible for forming connective tissue react to increases in TSH levels.|$|R

5|$|In May 1949, it was {{reported}} that Lympne had made a loss of £17,000 and that the Air Ministry was looking to dispose of it, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that should a sale not materialise it would continue in operation. In August 1950, Air Kruise started a scheduled service between Lympne and Le Touquet using Dragon Rapides. This service was operated under an associate airline agreement with British European Airways.|$|E
5|$|In the middle, {{and not to}} Michelangelo’s liking, {{stood the}} {{original}} equestrian statue of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Michelangelo provided an unassuming pedestal for it. The sculpture was held in regard because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> to depict Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor. The bronze now in position is a modern copy; the original is in the Palazzo dei Conservatori nearby.|$|E
5|$|In the past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased {{the risk of}} hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to}} be incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E

5|$|Initially, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the}} {{compromise}} of HD DVD's security would entice some studios into adopting the competing Blu-ray format, but Blu-ray's AACS implementation {{has since been}} circumvented using a similar method. However, Blu-ray offers an additional layer of protection called BD+.|$|E
5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> the states would not accept.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that Bradman {{would play}} Ring, but {{he changed his}} mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> that St Kessog {{was killed}} here.|$|R

5|$|Lisa {{was born}} in Florence on June 15, 1479, on Via Maggio, {{although}} for many years <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> she was born {{on one of the}} family's rural properties, Villa Vignamaggio just outside Greve. She is named for Lisa, a wife of her paternal grandfather. The eldest of seven children, Lisa had three sisters, one of whom was named Ginevra, and three brothers, Giovangualberto, Francesco, and Noldo.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few small}} populations of B.acanthopoda exist. Until 1999, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> to occur only in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region, in the {{vicinity}} of Woodanilling and Katanning; since then, a population has been found in the Jarrah Forest region, south of Darkan.|$|E
