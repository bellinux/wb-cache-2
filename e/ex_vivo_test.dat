A much longer contact time was required for the AHRs to achieve a bactericidal effect using the <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test</b> (between 10 and > 20 min) compared with the in vitro test.

Since the AHRs had no residual activity, the bactericidal effect achieved using the <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test</b> with contact times greater than the evaporation times (15 s) is unlikely to be achieved in practice. In view of such findings it is unlikely that AHRs are able to achieve a significant bactericidal effect (≥ 4 log(10) reduction) in practice, suggesting that contamination on the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) may not be reduced enough to overcome the risk of cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infection. Since the AHRs had no residual effect they would be unable to prevent recolonisation of the hands of HCWs...|$|E

Abacavir-specific immunological responses were assessed to improve precision of the HSR diagnostic classification, {{and to provide}} insights into possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The abacavir-exposed cohort comprised prospectively tested patients (n= 48) and retrospectively analysed abacavir-exposed individuals (n= 200). Diagnostic precision was assessed using epicutaneous patch testing, and immunological response to ex vivo abacavir exposure measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression (three-colour flow cytometry) or whole blood extracellular TNF-α (chemiluminescence). Depletion of CD 4 and CD 8 cells was undertaken to determine {{the characteristics of the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted immune response.

Methods: After spine CT acquisition, each vertebra is segmented and the surgeon plans screw positioning in a virtual environment, then the template is designed around the chosen trajectories. This design is based on surgical and mechanical considerations to obtain an optimal solution to guarantee template stability, simple positioning and minimized intervention invasiveness. In vitro evaluation on synthetic spine models and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> animal <b>tests</b> on porcine specimens were performed, with the insertion of 28 Kirschner wires.

Most <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>tests</b> are performed within 24 hours of dissection, so the tissue is still “alive”. For large elastic arteries, however, the passive mechanical behavior is attributed mostly to the very stable proteins, elastin and collagen. If the testing equipment fails, is in use, or is located at another facility, {{it would be useful}} to store the vessels and postpone the tests until the equipment is available. The goal of this study is to determine the effects of storage time on the mechanical behavior of the common carotid artery from adult mice. Each artery was tested after storage for 1 – 28 days in physiologic saline at 4 °C. There were no significant effects of storage time on the arterial diameter or force at each pressure, but there were significant effects on the stretch ratio and stress at each pressure. The significant effects on the stretch ratio and stress were due to decreases in the unloaded dimensions with storage time, when measured from cut arterial rings. When the unloaded dimensions were measured instead from histology sections, there were no significant changes with storage time. We conclude that histology sections yield a more consistent measurement of the unloaded dimensions and that there are no significant changes in the mechanical behavior of mouse carotid artery with storage up to 28 days...|$|R

The purpose is to improve mucoadhesion in the oral environment, exploiting the well-known bioadhesive properties of CH and the mechanical retention of strips, by means of their innovative highly oriented micropattern of porosity. Methods: CH strips were produced by cathode electrodeposition. Morphological and physical characterization was performed using Optic microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and swelling degree analyses. Cytocompatibility with primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was verified by means of MTT assay and SEM images. Mucoadhesion was tested using an ex vivo retention model, based on porcine buccal mucosa and DMA Q 800 TA instrument. Results: CH strips displayed an oriented porosity, with pores of about 500 lm of diameter, and a random microporosity due to H 2 bubble production during synthesis (20 lm).

Since functional sensitivity of p 38 MAPK is commonly predicted by preclinical species, we systematically investigated interspecies differences including human tissue. Methods: <b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test</b> models were established using whole blood and primary cells from different species such as mice, rats, pigs and humans to compare LPS-induced TNF-α inhibition of four different p 38 MAPK reference inhibitors SB 203580, BIRB- 796, Pamapimod, and a Losmapimod analogue as well as a proprietary imidazole-based p 38 MAPK Inhibitor. Results: All analysed p 38 MAPK inhibitors resulted in significant inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α release but with high interspecies differences for dose sensitivity. IC 50 values from human whole blood and PBMC showed significant higher sensitivity towards p 38 MAPK inhibition compared with data from pig and rat. Conclusion: Inhibition of TNF-α release by p 38 MAPK inhibitors can be reliably identified in well-established laboratory species such as rat or mouse. However, our data indicate that animal models appear to be limited for valid prediction of the inhibitory potential for TNF-α release in humans.

40|$|International audienceCoffee {{consumption}} {{has been}} associated with a significant decrease in the risk of developing chronic diseases such as Parkinson disease, diabetes type- 2 and several types of cancers (e. g. colon, liver). In the present study, a coffee-dependent induction of enzymes involved in xenobiotic detoxification processes was observed in rat liver and primary hepatocytes. In addition, coffee was found to induce the mRNA and protein expression of enzymes involved in cellular antioxidant defenses. These inductions were correlated with the activation of the Nrf 2 transcription factor as shown using an ARE-reporter luciferase assay. The induction of detoxifying enzymes GSTs and AKR is compatible with a protection against both genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1). This hypothesis was confirmed in in vitro and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test</b> systems, where coffee reduced both AFB 1 -DNA and protein adducts. Interestingly, coffee was also found to inhibit cytochrome CYP 1 A 1 / 2, indicating that other mechanisms different from a stimulation of detoxification may also {{play a significant role in}} the chemoprotective effects of coffee. Further investigations in either human liver cell line and primary hepatocytes indicated that the chemoprotective effects of coffee against AFB 1 genotoxicity are likely to be of relevance for humans. These data strongly suggest that coffee may protect against the adverse effects of AFB 1. In addition, the coffee-mediated stimulation of the Nrf 2 -ARE pathway resulting in increased endogenous defense mechanisms against electrophilic but also oxidative insults further support that coffee may be associated with a protection against various types of chemical stresses...|$|E

As a proposed <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test,</b> {{we describe the}} assessment of the specificity of Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A] viral cytotoxicity and replication in human nonprostate primary cells. Four primary nonprostate cell types were selected to mimic the effects of potential in vivo exposure to Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A] virus: bronchial epithelial cells, urothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. Primary cells were analyzed for Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A] viral cytotoxicity in MTS assays, and viral replication was determined by hexon titer immunostaining assays to quantify viral hexon protein. The results revealed that at an extreme multiplicity of infection of 500, unlikely to be achieved in vivo, Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A] virus showed no significant cytotoxic effects in the nonprostate primary cell types apart from the hepatocytes. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed high levels of Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A] sequestered in the cytoplasm of these cells. Adenoviral green fluorescent protein reporter studies showed no evidence for nuclear localization, suggesting that the cytotoxic effects of Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A] in human primary hepatocytes are related to viral sequestration. Also, hepatocytes had increased amounts of coxsackie adenovirus receptor surface protein. Active viral replication was only observed in the permissive primary prostate cells and LNCaP prostate cell line, and was not evident in any of the other nonprostate cells types tested, confirming the specificity of Ad[I/PPT-E 1 A].

Static compression with 400 N for 2 h resulted in morphological changes comparable to physiological in vivo deformations in humans. We observed a decrease of the equilibrium Young’s modulus of the degenerated cartilage by - 59...|$|R
40|$|Background The high {{incidence}} of breast cancer has sparked the development of novel targeted and personalized therapies. Personalization of cancer treatment requires reliable prediction of chemotherapy responses in individual patients. Effective selection can prevent unnecessary treatment that would mainly result in the unwanted side effects of the therapy. This selection can be facilitated by characterization of individual tumors using robust and specific functional assays, which requires development of powerful <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> culture systems and procedures to analyze the response to treatment. Methods We optimized culture methods for primary breast tumor samples that allowed propagation of tissue <b>ex</b> <b>vivo.</b> We combined several tissue culture strategies, including defined tissue slicing technology, growth medium optimization and use of a rotating platform to increase nutrient exchange. Results We could maintain tissue cultures for at least 7 days without losing tissue morphology, viability or cell proliferation. We also developed methods to determine the cytotoxic response of individual tumors to the chemotherapeutic treatment FAC (5 -FU, Adriamycin [Doxorubicin] and Cyclophosphamide). Using this tool we designated tumors as sensitive or resistant and distinguished a clinically proven resistant tumor from other tumors. Conclusion This method defines conditions that allow <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>testing</b> of individual tumor responses to anti-cancer drugs and therefore might improve personalization of breast cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSelenium is a {{micronutrient}} {{needed by}} all living organisms including humans, but often present in low concentration in food with possible deficiency. From another side, at higher concentrations in soils as observed in seleniferous {{regions of the}} world, and in function of its chemical species, Se can also induce (eco) toxicity. Root Se uptake was therefore studied in function of its initial form for maize (Zea mays L.), a plant widely cultivated for human and animal food over the world. Se phytotoxicity and compartmentalization were studied in different aerial plant tissues. For the first time, Se oral human bioaccessibility after ingestion was assessed for the main Se species (SeIV and SeVI) with the BARGE <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test</b> in maize seeds (consumed by humans), and in stems and leaves consumed by animals. Corn seedlings were cultivated in hydroponic conditions supplemented with 1 mg L− 1 of selenium (SeIV, SeVI, Control) for 4 months. Biomass, Se concentration, and bioaccessibility were measured on harvested plants. A reduction in plant biomass was observed under Se treatments compared to control, suggesting its phytotoxicity. This plant biomass reduction was higher for selenite species than selenate, and seed was the main affected compartment compared to control. Selenium compartmentalization study showed that for selenate species, a preferential accumulation was observed in leaves, whereas selenite translocation was very limited toward maize aerial parts, except in the seeds where selenite concentrations are generally high. Selenium oral bioaccessibility after ingestion fluctuated from 49 to 89 % according to the considered plant tissue and Se species. Whatever the tissue, selenate appeared as the most human bioaccessible form. A potential Se toxicity was highlighted for people living in seleniferous regions, this risk being enhanced by the high Se bioaccessibility...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISITibiotarsal {{fractures}} {{are common}} in birds because in most birds this is the longest, most exposed bone in the leg. Transverse fractures are most common and rotational and shear forces must be stabilized {{in order to achieve}} good bone regeneration. A 230 g male Slender-billed Parakeet or Choroy parakeet (Enicognathus leptorhynchus), with more than five years of age, was received with non-weight bearing lameness with 24 hours duration. X-rays were taken, and these revealed a closed, complete, non-comminuted transverse fracture of the distal diaphysis of the left tibiotarsal bone. Fixation was planned with 10 -minute fast-setting epoxy putty. In order to assess the temperature of polymerization of the epoxy dough and the possibility of heat-bone necrosis, the temperature was recorded every 30 seconds for 12 minutes with three different amounts of the epoxy material in an <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>test.</b> The temperature of the pieces reached a peak of 50 - 60 °C, where the highest peak corresponds to the highest amount of material. When approximately 6 g of putty were used, the peak temperature reached only 51 °C. This peak changed to 58 °C when 4 times more epoxy was mixed and measured. If the temperature of the pins inserted in the bone exceeds 70 °C, bone necrosis could occur. In light of these results, the fracture was treated with 6 g of epoxy putty that was allowed to polymerize over a 1 A 2 / 2 external skeletal fixation, with 1 -mm pins bent at 90 ° and joined together with cerclage wire. At 6 weeks after surgery the bird had formed a good primary bone callus, and the external fixators were therefore removed. With this approach a satisfactory recovery of the patient was achieved with normal use of the affected limb...|$|E

30|$|For eye irritation, the {{situation}} is essentially quite similar. The replacement of the Draize test for eye irritation again was achieved by two methods. The <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP; [51, 52]) eye irritation test is used to identify strong eye irritation potential and the in vitro EpiOcular™ eye irritation test (EIT) is {{used to evaluate the}} irritation potential of compounds to the eye. The BCOP and similar <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>tests</b> utilize slaughterhouse material to assess the severe eye irritation potential of a test substance through its ability to induce opacity and increased permeability in, for example, an isolated bovine cornea. In contrast, the EIT and similar tests use the commercially available reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium (RhCE), which closely mimics the histological, morphological, biochemical and physiological properties of the human corneal epithelium to determine if a test substance is an eye irritant based on its ability to induce cytotoxicity in RhCE tissue, as measured by the MTT assay. These tests, and alternatives, are again used {{within the context of a}} simple testing strategy and described in further detail elsewhere [52 – 56].|$|R

40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} is {{a largely}} spread disfunction that affects more than 300 million people worldwide. At present, no technological solutions {{are able to}} restore continence in a minimally invasive and effective way. In this article the authors report the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel artificial endourethral urinary sphincter able to fully restore continence. The device can be inserted/retracted in a minimally invasive fashion without hospital admission, does not alter the body scheme and {{can be applied to}} both women and men. The device core is a unidirectional polymeric valve and a magnetically activated system able to modulate its opening pressure. Bench <b>tests</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>tests</b> on a human cadaver demonstrated that the device is able to fully restore continence and to allow urination when desired. Overall, the proposed system shows a high potential as a technological solution able to restore a normal daily life in patients affected by urinary incontinence...|$|R
