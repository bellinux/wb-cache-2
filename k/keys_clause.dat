This was by congressional design. Yet, despite the dire predictions, for most of the first decade of AEDPA’s reign, the door to habeas relief remained open.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the <b>key</b> <b>clauses</b> of the {{government}} contract for health care provision to asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island, and examines their adequacy in providing for {{mental and physical health}} needs. IntroductionWith the recent return to processing of asylum seekers in Regional Processing Centres (RPCs) on Nauru and Manus Island, a major concern for refugee advocates and human rights groups is the mental health status of asylum seekers being accommodated in these facilities. This concern stems from the perceived lack of specialist mental health resources available and the indefinite nature of detention. Previous experience has shown that offshore processing of asylum seekers can have serious consequences for both physical and mental health. Amnesty International raised concerns about the physical health of asylum seekers in its November 2012 review of the Nauru Offshore Processing Facility, as conditions in the processing centres, such as heat, lack of shade and inadequate accommodation, were considered to be contributing to poor physical health. More recently, the ABC program Four Corners highlighted the conditions in the Nauru and Manus Island processing centres, and the concerns of former staff about access to health care and the health status of asylum seekers in this context. As at 27 May 2013, there were 430 asylum seekers on Nauru and 302 on Manus Island. The combined total capacity of the facilities on Nauru and Manus Island is expected to reach around 2, 100 by the end of 2013 (600 on Manus Island and 1, 500 on Nauru). Current capacity is 500 on Manus Island and 528 on Nauru. The provision of health care to asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island is governed by the ‘Heads of Agreement’ between the Commonwealth of Australia (represented by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC)) and International Health and Medical Services (IHMS) (the contract). The contract was tabled in the Senate on 21 September 2012, with the payment schedule and financial details redacted. Despite this, some financial details are known, such as that IHMS will be paid $ 22 million for the provision of health care for six months from 14 December 2012. The contract was not published online and is only available from the Senate Table Office. In the absence of an online document, this background note will set out the <b>key</b> <b>clauses</b> of the contract and examine their adequacy in providing for the mental and physical health needs of asylum seekers being detained in RPCs. IHMS has provided health care services in immigration detention facilities in Australia since 2006. As at March 2012, the value of the two contracts with IHMS (one for a six year period covering services for Christmas Island and one for a five year period covering the mainland) was estimated to be $ 769. 3 million. In 2010 – 11 more than 100, 000 individual health services were delivered in immigration detention facilities. The number of IHMS community-based health service providers increased by 40 per cent to more than 700 in 2010 ‑ 11. These providers deliver services to the community detention network on behalf of IHMS. There is no provision in the contract to penalise the organisation for underperformance. In May 2013, the Government announced that families who arrive by boat would be considered for bridging visas in the community, but would be subject to the same ‘no advantage’ principle as those held on Nauru and Manus Island. It is likely that these asylum seekers will not have the same access to health care services as those on Nauru and Manus Island, as they will not have access to Medicare and it does not appear that DIAC has a specific contract for the provision of health care services to this group in Australia. Exploration of this issue is outside the scope of this paper...|$|R

This research aims to solve the problems of (1) how such formal nonequivalence appears in the translation of behavioral clauses and (2) how to achieve functional equivalence through the presence of formal nonequivalence. This study was directed to deliberately analyze a written text in English and its translation in Indonesian. It was found out that formal nonequivalence may occur in word, phrase, and clause levels.

However, although new standards have been introduced, very little {{attention has been paid to}} reviewing the existing BCM maturity models in research - especially in the light of the new ISO 22301 standard for BCM. In this thesis the existing BCM maturily models are carefully evaluated to determine whetherthey could be improved. In order to accomplish this, the compliance of the existing models to the ISO 22301 standard is measured and a framework for assessing a maturitymodel´s quality is defined. After carefully evaluating the existing frameworks for maturity model development and evaluation, an approach suggested by Becker et al. (2009) was chosen as the basis for the research. An additionto the procedural model a set of seven research guidelines proposed by the same authors was applied, drawing on the design-science research guidelines as suggested by Hevner et al. (2004). Furthermore, the existing models´ form and function was evaluated to address their usability. Based on the evaluation of the existing BCM maturity models, the existing models were found to have shortcomings in each dimension of the evaluation. Utilizing the best of the existing models, a draft version for an enhanced model was developed.

The Short Time movement saw no need for further investigation and Lord Ashley - now the champion of factory reform in the Commons - introduced another Ten-Hour Bill without waiting for the Commission's report. The short time committees of the textile districts organised mass demonstrations for a Ten-Hour Act, the rhetoric becoming more heated ("Tt {{is a question of}} blood against gold. Infants' blood has been sold for nought, but if we are despised now., it shall be a question of blood in another sense" [...] Oastler told a vast demonstration at Wibsey Low Moor at the start of July) as the aim was no longer seen to be convincing the public of the need for factory reform, but rather deterring the government from using the Commission to avoid any meaningful reform. They attempted to organise a boycott of the Commission and to ensure that wherever the Commissioners went in the textile districts they were met with large demonstrations for a Ten-Hour Bill, and against the Commissioners. Oastler was the 'centre of communication' for the organisation, and prominent in the agitation against the Commission. Pressure for a Ten Hour Act was sustained, and Lord Ashley introduced another Ten-Hour Bill without waiting for the report of the Factory Commission. When the report came out, it recommended an eight-hour day for children under thirteen, with a declared aim of allowing mills to operate sixteen hours a day by a 'relay system' employing two sets of children. This addressed the issue of child labour on which the short time movement had been able to gain public sympathy without giving any restriction on adult hours of work. Despite winning a number of Parliamentary votes, Ashley was unable to secure a majority for <b>key</b> <b>clauses</b> in his Bill, and withdrew it, leaving the way open for Lord Althorp to pilot through a Factory Act in line with the Commission recommendations. The 1833 Factory Act was unsatisfactory not merely to the Ten-Hour movement but to all interested parties. Members of the government had openly described Althorp's Act as 'an evil forced upon the Government'. Mill-owners (whether reconciled to the principle of state intervention or not) objected that the textile districts did not have the significant pool of unemployed children needed for a 'relay system': it was therefore virtually impossible to attempt to comply with the Act. Furthermore, mill-owner magistrates, who had been barred from hearing cases brought under the previous Factory Acts, were allowed to hear cases under the 1833 Act, which they saw no point in enforcing: only if non-compliance {{came to the attention of}} a Factory Inspector (given powers to act as a JP by the Act) was there any prospect of a successful prosecution ...|$|R
