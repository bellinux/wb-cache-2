40|$|AbstractThe Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, {{developed}} by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory, has been configured to simulate the dispersion and deposition of nuclear materials from a surface-based nuclear detonation using publicly available information on nuclear explosions. Much of the information was obtained from “The Effects of Nuclear Weapons” by Glasstone and Dolan (1977). The model was evaluated against the measurements of nuclear fallout from six nuclear tests conducted between 1951 and 1957 at the Nevada Test Site using the global NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project (NNRP) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological data as input. The model was able to reproduce the general direction and deposition patterns using the coarse NNRP data with Figure of Merit in Space (FMS – the percent overlap between predicted and measured deposition patterns) scores in excess of 50 % for four of six simulations for the smallest <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> <b>contour,</b> with FMS scores declining for higher <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> <b>contours.</b> When WRF meteorological data were used the FMS scores were 5 – 20 % higher {{in five of the}} six simulations, especially at the higher <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> <b>contours.</b> The one WRF simulation where the scores declined slightly (10 – 30 %) was also the best scoring simulation when using the NNRP data. When compared with measurements of <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> and time of arrival from the Town Data Base (Thompson et al., 1994), similar results were found with the WRF simulations providing better results for four of six simulations.

First, the properties of the photon radiation probe were determined. The stochastic radiation transport code, MCNP 5, was used to develop computational models for the linac. The spectral distribution of photons as well as <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> <b>contour</b> maps of the UNLV accelerator facility were computed for several linac operating configurations. These computational models were validated through comparison with experimental measurements of <b>dose</b> <b>rates.</b> The linac model was used to simulate the photon interrogation of SNM targets of various compositions and shielding materials. The spectra of neutrons produced by the irradiation of shielded SNM was characterized. The effects of shielding material and the SNM enrichment on the neutron yields following photon assay were determined. It was determined that the radiation signatures following the photon assay of SNM consisted of photons and neutrons produced from the fissions, in addition to neutrons produced from photonuclear reactions. The EJ- 299 - 33 A plastic scintillator was evaluated for this study due to its ability to discriminate between fast neutrons and gamma rays. The neutron coincidence measurement option was also evaluated. The detector response functions were determined for different incident neutron energies.

40|$|Dose {{assessments}} produced {{using the}} computer code MCNP {{are important to}} simulate events {{that are difficult to}} recreate experimentally. An emergency scenario involving whole-body skin contamination is one example of such an event. For these scenarios, an anthropomorphic phantom of a 10 -year-old male with uniform skin contamination was created and combined with MCNP for dose calculations. Activity on the skin was modeled with gamma-ray sources at energies of 50 keV, 100 keV, 250 keV, 500 keV, 750 keV, 1 MeV, 1. 25 MeV, 1. 5 MeV, and 2 MeV. The radionuclides 60 Co, 137 Cs, and 131 I were also modeled. The effective dose to the body and major organs was calculated for each scenario. Exposure <b>rate</b> <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> were also produced around the body. The activity required to result in a dose equal to the legal limit of 0. 1 mSv for minors was calculated for each scenario. The highest activity required to produce this limit was from the 50 keV gamma-ray source. This activity was increased by an arbitrary value, approximately tenfold the current value, to represent an emergency scenario. This new activity concentration of 1 mCi per 100 cm 2 was used to produce doses for each of the scenarios. The lowest effective dose for the body was 0. 82 mSv, produced from the 50 keV source. The highest effective dose was 19. 59 mSv, produced from the 2 MeV source. The exposure rates nearest the body were approximately 1. 25 R/h, decreasing to 100 mR/h approximately 60 cm from the body. The data points were found to be dependent on the energy of the gamma ray. These data can also be improved by deriving solutions previously assumed in this scenario. For example, the skin may be broken down into multiple regions to allow for independent calculations for regional contamination. The activity on the skin can also be derived from air concentration models, allowing for the use of other models to be used in conjunction with this research...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing a {{lava flow}} {{emplacement}} model and a satellite-based land cover classification, we produce a map to allow {{assessment of the}} type and quantity of natural, agricultural and urban land cover at risk from lava flow invasion. The {{first step is to}} produce lava effusion <b>rate</b> <b>contours,</b> i. e., <b>lines</b> linking distances down a volcano’s flank that a lava flow will likely extend if fed at a given effusion rate from a predetermined vent zone. This involves first identifying a vent mask and then running a downhill flow path model from the edge of every pixel around the vent mask perimeter {{to the edge of the}} DEM. To do this, we run a stochastic model whereby the flow path is projected 1, 000 times from every pixel around the vent mask perimeter with random noise being added to the DEM with each run so that a slightly different flow path is generated with each run. The FLOWGO lava flow model is then run down each path, at a series of effusion rates, to determine likely run-out distance for channel-fed flow extending down each path. These results are used to plot effusion <b>rate</b> <b>contours.</b> Finally, effusion <b>rate</b> <b>contours</b> are projected onto a land classification map (produced from an ASTER image of Etna) to assess the type and amount of each land cover class falling within each contour. The resulting maps are designed to provide a quick look-up capability to assess the type of land at risk from lava extending from any location at a range of likely effusion rates. For our first (2, 000 m) vent zone case used for Etna, we find a total of area of ~ 680 km 2 is at risk from flows fed at 40 m 3 s− 1, of which ~ 6 km 2 is urban, ~ 150 km 2 is agriculture and ~ 270 km 2 is grass/woodland. The model can also be run for specific cases, where we find that Etna’s 1669 vent location, if active today, would likely inundate almost 11 km 2 of urban land, as well as 15. 6 km 2 of agricultural land, including 9. 5 km 2 of olive groves and 5. 2 km 2 of vineyards and fruit/nut orchards...|$|R

It is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function f(x, y) parallel to the x, y plane. In cartography, a <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> (often just called a [...] "contour") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level. A contour map is a map illustrated with <b>contour</b> <b>lines,</b> for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and hills, and the steepness or gentleness of slopes. [...] The contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive <b>contour</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
