25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; {{it is as if}} they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.|$|E

You have sacrificed {{so much for}} the righteous cause already, that I know you will present this last and most precious offering also with the fortitude of your character and the submission of a Christian. Still, I know how valuable this son of yours had been to your interests, how dear to your heart, and I cannot tell you, with what deep and sincere grief <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> your terrible loss." ...|$|E
500|$|Newman, a {{professional}} artist from Minneapolis, {{responded to the}} curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure {{how to use a}} canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying [...] "I almost threw it out until <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Fallout {{designer}} Chris Taylor {{said they}} [...] "never expected that Dogmeat would {{become such a}} popular character." [...] Taylor said: [...] "I always intended that the various NPCs that joined up with the player would come to a violent end. I was shocked when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> all the work people went through to keep Dogmeat alive to the end – especially the hell that they went through with the force fields in the Military Base." [...] According to Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas designer Chris Avellone, Dogmeat is [...] "arguably the most successful NPC companion ever" [...] for several reasons: [...] "One, he doesn't talk, so the players can project a personality on to him. Two, he's effective in combat ... and three, he's a dog that stays with you through thick-and-thin. I don't think there's a deeper 'awww' sentiment than people have in their hearts for their pets." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the hiring of a new assistant, I began to wonder if the full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of Friday 8November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like [...] "Body in sack... countess runs out screaming", and [...] "Belgravia murder– earl sought". A meeting that day at the Clermont, between John Aspinall, Daniel Meinertzhagen, Charles Benson, Stephen Raphael, Bill Shand-Kydd, and Dominick Elwes, became the cause of much press speculation. Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but {{the relationship between the}} police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an [...] "Eton mafia" [...] worked against them. Susan Maxwell-Scott refused to add to her statement, and when Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, was asked if she could help locate Lucan's body, she replied [...] "The last <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him, he was being fed to the tigers at my son's zoo", prompting the police to search the house and the animal cages there. They searched fourteen country houses and estates, including Holkham Hall and Warwick Castle, to no avail. Amidst concerns expressed by the Labour MP Marcus Lipton that some people were [...] "being a bit snooty" [...] with the police, Benson wrote a letter to The Times asking him to either identify those people or [...] "kindly withdraw his remarks". To their cost, Private Eye accused James Goldsmith of being at the Clermont meeting, when he was actually in Ireland. Dominic Elwes went to see Lady Lucan in hospital and was reportedly deeply shocked both by her appearance and her statement [...] "Who's the mad one now?" [...] Elwes was apparently unhappy at some of the negative press coverage of the countess, and was later ostracised by his friends for his part in an article critical of Lucan, which appeared in the Sunday Times Magazine. He committed suicide in September 1975.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 September 1884, Gordon's {{fortunes}} took a {{turn for}} the worse when the most able of his subordinates Mohammed Aly together with about 1, 000 of Gordon's best troops were killed in an ambush, while conducting a raid. Gordon wrote in his diary that Mohammed Aly had captured [...] "a lad of 12 or 14 years of age, and the little chap spoke out boldly, and said he believed Mohamed Ahmed was the Mahdi and that we were dogs. He was shot! Before <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> our defeat <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> this, and I thought, 'THAT will not pass unavenged'." ...|$|E

Speaking about the show, Wallace commented: [...] "I have always loved working on EastEnders so when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> this new drama to take Kat and Alfie outside of Walford, I couldn’t believe our luck. To be exploring the next chapter for Kat as well as working alongside my best mate, Shane, is {{a dream come true}} and a huge compliment." [...] The series, [...] began airing in May 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Mubarak {{also told}} reporters the {{incident}} was [...] "strange and regrettable... When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it, I said, 'What piracy is this?' I never thought that a friendly country would send four jetfighters to intercept an unarmed civilian plane. I was amazed. I believe it is theatrics and not heroism." [...] Reflecting on the U.S. relation with Egypt he said [...] "May God help us to get over this matter. A long time must pass before {{we will be able}} to forget this painful wound." [...] Outside Egypt's Cario University thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans clashed with police – at least 30 were injured and dozens arrested. Some demonstrators called for Mubarak's assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Zhou Jun (周峻), {{the son of}} Zhou Yu's elder brother, was {{appointed}} as a Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) and placed in command of 1,000 men by Sun Quan because of his uncle's meritorious service. After Zhou Jun died, Quan Cong requested for Sun Quan to commission Zhou Jun's son, Zhou Hu (周護), as a military officer but Sun declined. Sun Quan replied, [...] "In the past, we managed to defeat Cao Cao and obtain Jing Province because of Gongjin's efforts. I've never forgotten his contributions. When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Zhou Jun's death, I intended to recruit Zhou Hu into the civil service, but I've also heard that Zhou Hu is ruthless and treacherous in his ways. I was worried he'll cause trouble if he's given an official appointment so I decided to not recruit him. My memories of Gongjin are lasting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Statements {{taken by}} Major Edward W. Wynkoop and his {{adjutant}} substantiated the later accounts of survivors. These statements were filed with his reports {{and can be}} found in the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, copies of which were submitted as evidence in the Joint Committee of the Conduct of the War and in separate hearings conducted by the military in Denver. Lieutenant James D. Cannon describes the mutilation of human genitalia by the soldiers, [...] "men, women, and children's privates cut out. I heard one man say that he had cut a woman's private parts out and had them for exhibition on a stick. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> one instance of a child, a few months old, being thrown into the feed-box of a wagon, and after being carried some distance, left on the ground to perish; I also heard of numerous instances in which men had cut out the private parts of females and stretched them over their saddle-bows, and some of them over their hats." ...|$|E

To be exploring the next chapter for Kat as well as working alongside my best mate, Shane, is a dream come true and a huge compliment." [...] Richie said, [...] "Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming." [...] Treadwell-Collins later spoke again about the new series: [...] "We want to create something big around [...] EastEnders as a brand can afford to do it and I've always wanted to do something like that. I'm from Ireland originally, so it's a place I know well. Shane's Irish, Jessie’s half Irish—so, there’s an Irish connection between all of us. The other important thing about the spin-off show is it's not just about Kat and Alfie—we've created a whole new world and a new lot of characters. The writers have created a really lovely, interesting world, but also with our style of storytelling." [...] EastEnders previously had a storyline set in Ireland in 1997, which was heavily criticised for its unflattering depiction of Irish life, but Richie stated the series would not parody Irish life or [...] "play the dopey card".|$|E
