40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis report examines {{the effect of}} including real property depreciation in the U. <b>S.</b> Coast <b>Guard's</b> <b>overhead</b> costs. The following accounting concepts are discussed as to the nature and appropriateness to the Yard's accounting: asset valuation, useful life determination, depreciation and asset capitalization criteria. Two methods of overhead allocation are presented and contrasted. The first method is currently used by the Yard {{and the second is}} a proposed replacement. A $ 1, 000. capitalization threshold is proposed to replace the current $ 200 threshold. The real property assets are depreciated {{on the basis of their}} historical cost and by the straight line method. Their depreciation costs are distributed to the appropriate cost centers. From there the costs are allocated to overhead by both allocation methods. The effect of a $ 1, 000 capitalization threshold is then added in to the calculations. A new rate structure is computed twice for both allocation methods: at the current capitalization threshold and at the $ 1, 000 capitalization threshold. The four concurring rates are applied to sample Yard projects to contrast their effects on overhead costs. This report concludes that information based on historical cost is irrelevant due to inflation. A recommendation is made to use current cost, which would produce more useful information to determine the current operating costs of the Coast Guard Yard. [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|R

But there are also examples differing from those Driver has mentioned that favour the idea of such virtues. Perhaps certain virtues of religious faith and the virtue necessary for dealing as best one can with moral dilemmas both require ignorance. However, some of the examples Driver does discuss raise the question whether virtue status is based solely on consequences, rather than perhaps having (in addition) a motivational component. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} fork-lift truck vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of fork-lift truck in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the <b>overhead</b> <b>guard</b> is connected with the frame by the rubber cushion blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the rubber cushion blocks (shock mount) in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved fork-lift truck and vibration energy are lower. The result proves the practical value of this method in the research of the vibration characteristics of complete engineering machine...|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} World War II, like World War I before, spurred {{the use of}} {{forklift}} trucks in the war effort. Following the war, more efficient methods for storing products in warehouses were being implemented. Warehouses needed more maneuverable forklift trucks that could reach greater heights and new forklift models were made that filled this need. For example, in 1954 a British company named Lansing Bagnall, now part of KION Group, developed what was {{claimed to be the}} first narrow aisle electric reach truck. The development changed the design of warehouses leading to narrower aisles and higher load stacking that increased storage capability. During the 1950s and 1960s operator safety became a concern due to the increasing lifting heights and capacities. Safety features such as load back rests and operator cages, called <b>overhead</b> <b>guards,</b> began to be added to forklifts produced in this era. In the late 1980s ergonomic design began to be incorporated in new forklift designs to improve operator comfort, reduce injuries and increase productivity. During the 1990s exhaust emissions from forklift operations began to be addressed which led to emission standards being implemented for forklift manufacturers in various countries. The introduction of AC power forklifts, along with fuel cell technology, are also refinements in continuing forklift development.|$|R

The infrastructure handles platform and application heterogeneity, as well as dynamic adaptation to resource variations.

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an Inter-Autonomous System (AS) routing {{protocol}} currently {{used in the}} Internet.

However, a large number of BGP update messages may flood the Internet routers. In this thesis, we propose a new algorithm called MRAI with Flexible Load Dispersing (FLD-MRAI) that reduces the router 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>overhead</b> by dispersing the load in case {{of a large number of}} BGP update messages.

40|$|Abstract. Mobility-pricing {{is one of}} the avenues {{leading to}} the {{information}} highway. Using a combination of positioning, communication and information processing, automobile insurance can be priced based on actual mileage of the vehicle. Vehicle s location is periodically and electronically disclosed to a central server for invoice generation. This raises the possibility of this data being used to reveal the <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> identity and social activity. Past research has only been speculative of the motorists privacy perspective. This paper uses mobility-priced insurance as a case study and reports the results of a survey where respondents are asked to indicate their preferred trade-off between location privacy and the setup costs of a hypothetical mobility-priced insurance product. The respondents are also asked about their willingness to reveal location information to various social groups {{as a function of the}} time of day and day of week. It is hoped that the results of this research can be used to influence the design of other mobility-based payment systems.
