5000|$|Lloyd <b>Fuller</b> <b>Harding</b> (August 23, 1915 - January 10, 2010) was an {{attorney}} in Campbellsville, Kentucky, who served in 1942 as a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from District 36 (Taylor and Adair counties). He was also for twenty-four years the county attorney of Taylor County. [...] Harding was born in Campbellsville to Abel Turner Harding (1881-1966), also {{an attorney}}, and the former Mary Moore. He graduated from Campbellsville High School in 1933 and received his undergraduate degree from Carson-Newman College, a Baptist liberal arts institution in Jefferson City, Tennessee. He obtained his legal degree from the University of Louisville School of Law in Louisville, Kentucky. He {{was a member of}} the Campbellsville Baptist Church. After a year, Harding left the legislature to enter the United States Navy during World War II, having served for three and a half years. [...] He had succeeded fellow Republican lawmaker Herschel T. Baker (died 1963) of Columbia, the seat of Adair County, who served from 1936 to 1937 and again from 1940 to 1941. Robert S. Clark (born 1931), retired vice president for academic affairs at Baptist-affiliated Campbellsville University, said that Harding's father was instrumental in soliciting funds in the early 1900s to open Russell Creek Academy, which in 1906 became Campbellsville College, the forerunner of Campbellsville University. <b>Fuller</b> <b>Harding</b> served for five years on the CU board of trustees. In 1967, at the age of fifty-two, the longtime bachelor married the former Willye R. Crawford (August 10, 1909 - September 13, 1996). [...] On August 3, 2008, he wed the former Martha Tucker Gaddie Burress, who survived him. There were two stepdaughters, Rosalind Tender of Lexington, Kentucky, and Elizabeth Tillotson of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Campbellsville University President Michael V. Carter (born ca. 1955) said that Harding's [...] "many accomplishments during his career illustrate the numerous ways in which he had impacted the lives of numerous people. had a wonderful sense of humor. One of the patriarchs of our community has been lost with his passing." [...] George Barry Bertram, Sr. (born 1935) of Campbellsville, a Democrat who served as a commonwealth's attorney until his retirement in 2006 and is also a CU trustee, recalled that Harding was always immaculately dressed and wore a signature hat. According to Bertram, Harding was a [...] "strong Republican" [...] who kept up with state and local politics long after he had left the legislature. Harding died of a lengthy illness in the same house in Campbellsville where he was born ninety-four years earlier. Harding is interred at Brookside Cemetery in Campbellsville. His pallbearers included Ray H. Altman, also a former state representative from Campbellsville. Shortly after his death, the Kentucky House honored Harding's service.

40|$|A central {{paradox of}} coding {{theory has been}} noted for many years, and {{concerns}} the existence and construction of the best codes. Virtually every linear code is "good" {{in the sense that}} it meets the Gilbert-Varshamov bound on distance versus redundancy. Despite the sophisticated constructions for codes derived over the years, however, no one has succeeded in demonstrating a constructive procedure which yields such codes over arbitrary symbol fields. A quarter of a century ago, Wozencraft and Reiffen, in discussing this problem, stated that "we are tempted to infer that any code of which we cannot think is good. " Using the theory of Kolmogorov complexity, we show the remarkable fact that this statement holds true in a rigorous mathematical sense: any linear code which is truly random, in the sense that there is no concise way of specifying the code, is good. Furthermore, random selection of a code which does contain some constructive pattern results, with probability bounded away from zero, in a code which does not meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound regardless of the block length of the code. In contrast to the situation for linear codes, we show that there are effectively random non-linear codes which have no guarantee on distance, and that over all rates, the average non-linear code has much lower distance than the average linear code. These techniques are used to derive original results on the performance of various classes of codes, including shortened cyclic, generalized Reed-Solomon, and general non-linear codes, under a variety of decoding strategies involving mixed burst- and random-error correction. The second part of the thesis deals with the problem of finding decoding algorithms for general linear codes. These algorithms are capable of <b>full</b> <b>hard</b> decision decoding or bounded soft decision decoding, and do not rely on any rare structure for their effectiveness. After a brief discussion of some aspects of the theory of NP-completeness as it relates to coding theory, we propose a simple model of a general decoding algorithm which is sufficiently powerful to be able to describe most of the known approaches to the problem. We provide asymptotic analysis of the complexity of various approaches to the problem under various decoding strategies (<b>full</b> <b>hard</b> decision decoding and bounded hard- and soft-decision decoding) and show that a generalization of information set decoding gives more efficient algorithms than any other approach known. Finally, we propose a new type of algorithm that synthesizes some of the advantages of information set decoding and other algorithms that exploit the weight structure of the code, such as the zero neighbours algorithm, and discuss its effectiveness...|$|E
