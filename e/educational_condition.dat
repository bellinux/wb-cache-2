5000|$|The Union Government on 22 December 2011 {{announced}} {{establishment of}} a sub-quota of 4.5% for religious minorities within the existing 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes.

50|$|WQED {{began to}} seek a removal of the {{non-commercial}} educational status which restricted the WQEX license as early as 1996, {{with the intention of}} selling the secondary UHF station outright in the hope that an infusion of cash would solve some of the financial woes of the main station. WQED's initial application to take WQEX commercial was rejected outright by the Federal Communications Commission, leaving it to pursue an alternate plan by which the station was almost sold to religious broadcaster Cornerstone Television in 1999. The original plan was to move WPCB-TV from channel 40 (a commercial license) to channel 16 (non-commercial educational WQEX), with Paxson Communications buying channel 40 and converting it to a Pax TV affiliate with the call letters WKPX-TV. This move, which would have led to a $35 million payout being split equally between Cornerstone and WQED, was approved conditionally by the Federal Communications Commission in 2000, allegedly after lobbying by Republican Senator John McCain on behalf of Pax president Lowell Paxson, an intervention which Senator McCain would later deny having made. However, in response to vociferous concerns from members of the Pittsburgh local community, the FCC did impose one condition on the sale: half of Cornerstone's programming needed to be of educational value, effectively respecting the non-commercial <b>educational</b> <b>condition</b> of WQEX's existing license.|$|E
5000|$|From {{a private}} school Joshua passed to the Borough Road school, Southwark, where he became a pupil teacher in 1838 and a full {{assistant}} in 1842. About two years later he was appointed head-master of the Kingsland Road school, Dalston. Studying hard in his spare hours, he in 1850 graduated B.A. in the University of London, and in 1852 proceeded M.A. (in classics). In 1852, after trial work there in the previous year, he joined {{the staff of the}} Borough Road Training College, soon after became vice-principal, and in 1856 succeeded to the principalship on the retirement of Dr. James Cornwell. He proved himself a brilliant teacher, especially stimulating his pupils by his lectures on 'Method' and by his enthusiasm for literature. Through life, he laid stress on the importance to the teacher of literary training. After contributing to some of Cornwell's educational treatises, he entered in 1861 into the political arena with Public Education : Why is a New Code needed ? In 1862, he helped in the organisation of the education section of the International Exhibition, and in 1803 Lord Granville, lord president of the council, who on a visit to Borough Road was impressed by Fitch's power as a teacher, made him an inspector of schools. The district assigned to Fitch was the county of York, with the exception of certain portions of the north and the west. His three reports on the Yorkshire district admirably describe its <b>educational</b> <b>condition</b> then. From 1865 to 1867, as assistant commissioner for the schools inquiry commission, he inspected the endowed and proprietary schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in the city and ainsty of York, as well as other endowed schools in the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire and in Durham, and his reports were most thorough and suggestive. In 1869, he acted as special commissioner on elementary education in the groat towns (Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Leeds), and from 1870 to 1877 was an assistant commissioner of endowed schools. From 1877 to 1883, Fitch performed ordinary official duties as inspector of East Lambeth. In 1883, he became chief inspector of schools for the eastern division, including all the eastern counties from Lincoln to Essex. From 1885 to 1889, he was inspector of elementary training colleges for women in England and Wales. He was continued in this post till 1894, five years beyond the normal age of retirement from government service. Occasionally detached for special duties in the later period of his public service, he prepared in 1888, after a visit to America, a report on American education under the title Notes on American Schools and Training Colleges in 1891 a memorandum on the Free School System in the United States, Canada, France, and Belgium and in 1893 Instructions to H.M. Inspectors, with Appendices on Thrift and Training of Pupil Teachers. Fitch's educational activities passed far beyond his official work. His association with the University of London was always close. From 1860 to 1865 and from 1869 to 1874, he was examiner in English language and history. In 1875, he was appointed to the senate, and on his retirement in 1900 was made a life fellow. Much of his energy was always devoted to the improvement of the education of women. He was an original member of the North of England Council for the Higher Education of Women (founded in 1866) and one of those who helped to found in 1867 the College for Women at Hitchin, which in 1874 became Girton College, Cambridge. He took an active part in the establishment of the Girls' Public Day School Company in 1874, and was foremost among those who secured, in 1878, the new charter for the University of London which placed women students on equal terms with men. In 1890, he with Anthony John Mundella and Anna Swanwick selected the women's colleges and schools among which was distributed the sum of £60,000 left by Mrs. Emily Pfeiffer for the promotion of women's education. He was consulted by Thomas Holloway about the constitution of Holloway College, Egham, and by the founders of the Maria Grey Training College and the Cambridge Training College for the training of women teachers for secondary schools. In both 1877 and 1878, Fitch lectured with great success on practical teaching at the College of Preceptors, where he was examiner in the theory and practice of education (1879-81) and moderator in the same subjects (1881-1903). In 1879-80 he lectured at Cambridge for the newly appointed teachers' training syndicates and he published his course in 1881 as Lectures on Teaching (new edit. 1882). The book estabhshed Fitch's position in England and America as an expert on school management, organisation, and method. In 1897, he published Thomas and Matthew Arnold and their Influence on English Education in the Great Educators series, and in 1900 he collected his chief lectures and addresses in Educational Aims and Methods. Written with unusual charm of style, these volumes emphasised Fitch's position as that of a pioneer, especially on the practical side of education, as an earnest advocate for the better training of the elementary teacher, and for the more systematic training of secondary teachers. The National Home Reading Union established by Dr. John Brown Paton and Dr. Hill, Master of Downing College, owed much to Fitch's account of The Chautauqua Reading Circles, which he contributed to the Nineteenth Century after his return from America in 1888. After his retirement from the board of education in 1894, he was still active in public work. In 1895, {{he was a member of}} departmental committees of the board of education on industrial and naval and dockyard schools. In 1898-9, he was chairman of the council of the Charity Organisation Society. In 1902, he helped in the organisation of a nature study exhibition in London. Fitch, who was made hon. LL.D. of St. Andrews in 1888, and a chevalier of the legion of honour in 1889 by the French government in recognition of the services he rendered in England to French travelling scholars, was knighted in the 1896 Birthday Honours. He died at his residence, 13 Leinster Square, Bayswater, London, on 14 July 1903, and was buried at Kensal Green.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s {{the number}} of foreign {{children}} in schooling age has been increasing remarkably. Currently there are ninety thousand foreign children enrolled in Japanese public elementary and junior high schools. This {{research is part of}} a project on the <b>educational</b> <b>conditions</b> of the children of foreign workers in Tochigi prefecture. By focusing on the results of the survey conducted in 2005 that contains information on Brazilian and Peruvian parents and guardians' consciousness and attitude toward <b>educational</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{we have been able to}} examine the educational strategies followed by these two different groups of foreign workers and to state our own point of view on the issue. Particularly, this study focuses on the uncertainty caused by the indecision of staying or returning (or instability), and in turn how this uncertainty influences educational strategies, more specifically mother tongue education, school relationships, future career (further studies, working career, and so forth). The results of this research show that although more than the half of Brazilians and Peruvians living in Japan has been protractedly staying in this country for more than 10 years, the 69. 2 percent of Brazilian and the 56. 3 percent of Peruvian respondents are not able either to express or to determine clearly their return plans to their respective countries. The ambivalence regarding to the staying period plans of parents and guardians has impact on their children education strategies. Since previous analyses do not address these two groups, Brazilians and Peruvians, separately, this research intends to approach this academic lack in a comparative assessment. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the issues related to the <b>educational</b> <b>conditions</b> of foreign children require an analysis from different angles. ...|$|R
