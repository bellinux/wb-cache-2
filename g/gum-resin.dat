40|$|Buddhist {{literature}} {{not only}} contains teachings on doctrines and practices, but also ancient Indian knowledge such as medicine. This study investigates ancient Indian medicine in various {{versions of the}} Chapter on Medicine (CM) in the extant Vinaya Piṭaka-s, namely, the Theravāda Bhesajjakkhandhaka, the Dharmaguptaka Bhaiṣajyaskandhaka, the Mahīśāsaka Bhaiṣajyadharmaka, the Sarvāstivāda Bhaiṣajyadharmaka, the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhaiṣajyavastu, and the relevant parts in the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya. The CM contains numerous data on materia medica, cases of diseases and treatments, foods and drinks, and so on. This study focuses on the medicinal substances and the illnesses with their cures. The method employed is a three-fold interpretative method: narration of the relevant accounts of drugs and diseases in the primary sources; explanation of such data based on Buddhist commentaries and Āyurvedic lore; and translation of the information into modern medical/scientific terminology. This method involves rendering the records on medical data from original languages of Pāli, Sanskrit, and Chinese into English, and interpreting them {{with the help of}} Āyurvedic and modern biomedical knowledge. Before proceeding to the analyses and discussions of specific medical details in the CMs, preliminary information on certain aspects are provided. The history of ancient Indian medicine up to the Buddha’s time is described for understanding the context of medical knowledge recorded in the research materials. The sources – viz. the Vinaya Piṭaka and its Skandhaka section and the CM – are introduced. Concise histories and basic principles of the medical traditions of Āyurveda and modern biomedicine – through which the medical particulars in the CMs are interpreted – are presented. In addition, concepts of health and disease as well as medical principles found in early Buddhist discourses and disciplinary texts are generally discussed. Then, the medicinal substances listed in the CMs are categorised into seven-day medicines comprising lipids and sweets, and tallows; as well as medicines for use throughout one’s life, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, <b>gum-resins,</b> decoctions (astringent medicines), alkaline ashes, salts, and others such as scented substances, powders, putrid medicines, and some unclassifiable drugs. These drugs are reported as described in the CMs, explained by means of commentarial notes and Āyurvedic information, and translated into modern common and scientific names. Likewise, the accounts of diseases are classified and narrated, exposited with the help of Buddhist exegeses and Āyurveda, and then rendered into modern medical knowledge. The examined illnesses include: autumnal disease, wind diseases, disorders of humours or elements, fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, jaundice, snakebite, poisoning, ocular diseases, itchy lesions, carbuncles, wounds, other skin problems, perineal diseases, foot ailments, and insanity. This research makes contributions by presenting Buddhist perspectives on health/disease concepts, supplying much information about ancient Indian medical lore preserved by the early Buddhist community, and interpreting such medical facts to help readers better comprehend them. It also provides a suitable method for examining other medical materials in Buddhist texts. Furthermore, it could give rise to future studies on various topics relating to “Buddhist medicine”. published_or_final_versionBuddhist StudiesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
5000|$|The internationally renowned Bible scholar Bochart stated, at {{one point}} in his research, that onycha was {{actually}} benzoin, a <b>gum-resin</b> from the Styrax species. [...] H.J. Abrahams states that the use of benzoin in the Biblical incense is not inconceivable since Syro-Arabian tribes maintained extensive trade routes prior to Hellenism. Styrax Benzoin was available via import to the biblical lands during the Old Testament era. Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BCE indicates that different kinds of styrax resins were traded. Styrax benzoin was used by the ancient Egyptians in the art of perfumery and incense. The apothecary of Shemot (book of Exodus) would have been familiar with its aromatic uses. S. benzoin has a history steeped in antiquity and was once employed as an incense in Egypt. All the compounds identified in benzoin resin were detected in an archaeological organic residue from an Egyptian ceramic censer, thus proving that this resin was used as one of the components of the mixture of organic materials burned as incense in ancient Egypt. [...] An ancient Egyptian perfume formula (1200 BCE) contained benzoin as one of its chief ingredients. The name [...] "benzoin" [...] is probably derived from Arabic lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي, [...] "Javan frankincense"); compare the mid-eastern terms [...] "gum benjamin" [...] and [...] "benjoin". The word 'Storax' is an alteration of the Late Latin styrax. In the Orphic hymns it is στόρακας or στόρακα. As pointed out earlier, the original word shecheleth was replaced with onycha by the Septuagint translation. Onycha in turn is derived from the onyx stone meaning [...] "fingernail". Conder writes that [...] "the root of the Hebrew word shecheleth means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.” Another writer says that the Hebrew shecheleth identifies with the Syriac shehelta which is translated as “a tear or distillation” and that “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant [...] [...] [...] The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” The book of Ecclesiasticus lists storax as one of the ingredients when alluding to the sacred incense of the biblical tabernacle. [...] The Hindustanis use Benzoin to burn in their temples—a circumstance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that benzoin is part of the incense formula of Exodus. [...] The infrequent mention of benzoin by name in antiquity is quite suspicious considering its importance in ancient recipes. [...] It stands to reason it must have been known by another name not currently used today. References to it by name are conspicuously missing also from the Old Testament. Callcott writes “It has been suggested [...] that Gum Benzoin, which is not mentioned by any other name in scripture, must be onycha. Its fracture has exactly the lustre required by the name[...] [...] The gum is a secretion of the bark, and is of great efficacy in healing wounds[...] [...] Such are the pretensions of the Benzoin to be looked upon as the true Onycha, which, from the text, as I have already said, must have been some fragrant vegetable gum in itself, of foreign production, and ranking with stacte, and myrrh, and galbanum [...] [...] [...] all which conditions are fulfilled by the Gum Benzoin.” [...] Dioscorides and Galen describe two kinds of bdellium, the second of which is Benzoin, according to Hardouin and Sprengel. Pererra describes benzoin tears as [...] "flattened pieces, some of which are angular, and the larger of them [...] [...] [...] an inch in length." [...] He says that [...] "externally, these pieces are shiny." [...] This description most certainly fits well with the interpretation of [...] "onycha" [...] which means [...] "fingernail." [...] He continues to say many of the pieces [...] "are of an amber or reddish-yellow colour" [...] and continues to describe parts of it as [...] "translucent or milky, and frequently striped." [...] This is a good description of the appearance of various onyx stones, from which the name onycha is derived. He says that many tears of Styrax benzoin [...] "are translucent, or, in a few cases, almost transparent." [...] One type of benzoin has [...] "numerous, white, small pieces [...] [...] [...] intermingled, which thereby give the broken surface a speckled appearance" [...] which he calls [...] "marbly." [...] As mentioned above, although the word onycha has been interpreted as meaning [...] "nail" [...] it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx. Onyx comes in a variety of colors the most prominent being either the black and veined striped gem or the pinkish translucent striped gem. One related Styrax is black and the benzoin discussed thus far seems to be of the pinkish, translucent sort. Steeping Styrax benzoin tears in wine can enhance its fragrance as well as its translucent qualities and [...] "shiny" [...] appearance, thus making it appear even more like the onyx gem. Rambam stated that soaking onycha in wine made it beautiful. Benzoin tears look very different from other resins and appear to be small stones rather than the vegetable product that it is.|$|E

Boswellia serrata (Salai/Salai guggul), is a moderate to large sized branching tree of family Burseraceae (Genus Boswellia), grows in dry mountainous regions of India, Northern Africa and Middle East. Oleo <b>gum-resin</b> is tapped from the incision made on the trunk of the tree and is then stored in specially made bamboo basket for removal of oil content and getting the resin solidified. After processing, the <b>gum-resin</b> is then graded according to its flavour, colour, shape and size. In India, the States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh are the main source of Boswellia serrata. Regionally, it is also known by different names. The oleo gum-resins contain 30 - 60 % resin, 5 - 10 % essential oils, which are soluble in the organic solvents, and the rest is made up of polysaccharides. <b>Gum-resin</b> extracts of Boswellia serrata have been traditionally used in folk medicine for centuries to treat various chronic inflammatory diseases.

40|$|In 1917, Stockman (1) {{described}} {{the isolation of}} a toxic alkaloid from the seeds of Lathyrus sativus. He found that, in frogs, it produced paralysis of the motor nerve endings, and in mammals, a motor paresis referable to an action partly on the peripheral nerves and partly on the central nervous system. The present paper gives particulars of further experiments on the toxicity of lathyrus seeds. Lathyrus seeds contain abundance of starch, the grains being irregularly round or oval with a distinct hilum and definite concentric rings. Cane sugar is also present. Extraction with saline solution yields albuminous constituents which, by salting out, may be separated into leguinin, vicilin and legumelin. No evidence was found of a haemolytic or agglutinating body. An extract of the seeds with absolute alcohol gives on evapora-tion a residue, part of which is insoluble in water.

This study describes the type, architecture and distribution of resin secretory structures of B. papyrifera and its relevance for the ecophysiology and economic use of the tree. The type and architecture of resin secretory structures present in bark and wood was investigated from transversal, tangential and radial sections of bark and wood samples. The diameter and density (number of resin canals mm(2)) of axial resin canals were determined from digital images of thin sections across the different zones of inner bark. Resin canals form a three-dimensional network within the inner bark. Yet, the intact resin-conducting and producing network is on average limited to the inner 66 mm of the inner bark. Within the inner bark, the density of non-lignified axial resin canals decreases and the density of lignified resin canals increases from the vascular cambium towards the outer bark. In the wood, only radial resin canals were encountered. Frankincense tapping techniques can be improved based on knowledge of bark anatomy and distribution and architecture of resin secretory structures.

This study investigated the effects of boswellic acid on spatial learning and memory impairment induced by trimethyltin (TMT) in Wistar rats. Methods: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: Normal group, TMT-administrated rats (8. 0 mg/kg, Intraperitoneally, i. p.) and TMT + BA (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, i. p.) -administrated rats. BA was used daily for 21 days. To evaluate the cognitive improving of BA, we performed the Morris water maze test. Moreover, to investigate the neuroprotective effect of BA, we determined the acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity, the malondialdehyde (MDA) level as a marker of lipid peroxidation, and the glutathione (GSH) content in the cerebral cortex. Results: Treatment with TMT impaired learning and memory, and treatment with BA at a dose of 160 mg/kg produced a significant improvement in learning and memory abilities in the water maze tasks. Consistent with behavioral data, the activity of AChE was significantly increased in the TMT-injected rats compared to the control group (P < 0. 01) whereas all groups treated with BA presented a more significant inhibitory effect against AChE than the TMT-injected animals.

The structures of the active components were characterized by one- and two-dimensional 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as (2 &# 39;S, 5 &# 39;S) - 2 &# 39;-ethenyl- 5 &# 39;-(3 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 4 -oxohept- 5 -en- 2 -yl) - 7 -methoxy- 2 &# 39;-methyl- 4 H-spiro[chromene- 3, 1 &# 39;-cyclopentane]- 2, 4 -dione (1), which is an analogue of doremone A and a new natural compound, and as (2 &# 39;S, 5 &# 39;R) - 2 &# 39;-ethenyl- 5 &# 39;-[(2 R, 4 R) - 4 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 3 -oxohept- 5 -en- 2 -yl]- 7 -methoxy- 2 &# 39;-methyl- 4 H-spiro[chromene- 3, 1 &# 39;-cyclo-pentane]- 2, 4 -dione (2 = doremone A), (4 E, 8 E) - 1 -(2, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) - 5, 9, 13 -trimethyltetradeca- 4, 8, 12 -trien- 1 -one (3 = dshamirone), and 4, 7 -dihydroxy- 3 -[(2 E, 6 E) - 3, 7, 11 -trimethyldodeca- 2, 6, 10 -trien- 1 -yl]- 2 H-chromen- 2 -one (4 = ammoresinol). Dshamirone {{turned out to be the}} most active compound with an IC 50 value for AChE inhibitory activity of 23. 5 μM, whereas the other substances showed weak activity. The concentrations of the analytes in the resin were determined by HPLC as 3. 1 %, 4. 6 %, 1. 9 %, and 9. 9 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Frankincense, a much revered non-timber {{forest product}} (NTFP) known as luban in Oman, is a <b>gum-resin</b> {{extracted}} from Boswellia sacra (meqerot). In Oman, B. sacra is endemic to ecological zones in and around Dhofar's southern mountain ranges of Jabal Samhan, Jabal Qamar and Jabal Qara. Hojar (Samhan Nejd), Nejd (Qara Nejd), Shazr (Qamar Nejd) and Sha'b are the four B. sacra ecological zones. A suffix (i) after the name (i. e. Hojari or Samhan Nejdi) {{is indicative of the}} luban produced in or associated with the respective zone. Traditional Omani B. sacra ownership, management, organization, and frankincense extraction are based on a land parcel system known as menzela. The 1970 's oil boom attracted rural labor to urban and oil operation centers in Dhofar and other provinces, thus creating a labor shortage that had a profound transformative impact on frankincense production. This transformation caused frankincense extraction to evolve from an Omani-controlled system to a Somali-dominated hybrid system. Migrant Somali harvesters predominantly control the production and processing of frankincense in the field. Similarly, wholesalers occupy the next rung up the production ladder are the most powerful players in the frankincense industry. Dhofar {{has a long history of}} {{non-timber forest product}} (NTFP) extraction. From April to mid-June 1999, luban production in the Hojari/Nejdi zone of the study area was estimated at 8, 710 kg with a seasonal projection of 24, 840 kg- 30, 360 kg. B. sacra, a single or multiple stem shrub restricted to wadis in arid environments in or around the Dhofar Mountains, can be found at elevations from 60 m above sea level in Wadi Adonib on the coastal plains to 1, 770 m above sea level in Wadi Kharish (a branch of Wadi Qobyr) in jabal Samhan). Land-use and landcover changes in Dhofar are threatening the fragile stability of B. sacra habitats. Frankincense trees on easily accessible flat or gently sloping terrain are susceptible to stress and mortality from harvesting, grazing and mining, while trees on cliffs and steep slopes are less vulnerable to the effects of these land-use activities...|$|E
40|$|Spondias dulcis Forst. F. vem recebendo atenção especial por secretar uma goma que possui ação medicinal. Em outras espécies de Anacardiaceae, a maioria dos estudos sobre as estruturas secretoras refere-se à ultra-estrutura e desenvolvimento dos ductos, existindo poucas informações quanto à natureza química do secretado. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi caracterizar estrutural e histoquimicamente o sistema secretor do caule de S. dulcis. Amostras do caule jovem de plantas com 45 dias de idade foram submetidas às técnicas usuais em anatomia vegetal e a testes histoquímicos. O sistema secretor de S. dulcis apresenta ductos e idioblastos. Os ductos, muito longos, encontram-se associados ao floema e na medula, enquanto os idioblastos ocorrem no córtex e, também, associados ao floema. Os ductos apresentam um epitélio secretor unisseriado, formado por células cuneiformes a tabulares, de paredes delgadas, citoplasma denso e núcleo volumoso com nucléolo proeminente. Nos ductos associados ao floema, observam-se, externamente ao epitélio, duas a três camadas de células parenquimáticas, achatadas e dispostas radialmente, formando uma bainha. Os testes histoquímicos evidenciaram a presença de taninos nos idioblastos corticais. A secreção dos ductos é constituída, em sua maioria, por óleos essenciais, polissacarídeos e compostos fenólicos (provavelmente agliconas flavonóicas), o que permite caracterizá-la como uma gomorresina. Special {{attention}} {{is given to}} Spondias dulcis Forst. F. {{for its ability to}} secrete a gum with medicinal properties. In other species of Anacardiaceae, most of the studies report the ultrastructure and development of the ducts, being scarce data about the chemical composition of secretory products. The aim of this work is to study the anatomy of the secretory system of S. dulcis and characterize by histochemistry the secretion produced. Stems of plants with 45 days old were study by conventional plant anatomy methods. The main classes of secretion chemical compounds were characterized in situ by histochemical tests. The secretory system of S. dulcis consists in very elongate ducts and idioblasts. The ducts are associated to the phloem and in the pith, and the idioblasts occur near the phloem and in the cortex. Ducts are formed by a secretory epithelium of cuneiform to flattened cells, with thin walls, dense cytoplasm and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The ducts associated with phloem have, in addition to epithelium, two to three layers of flattened parenchyma cells arranged in a circle forming a sheath. The histochemical tests reveal the presence of tannins in the cortical idioblasts. The secretion of the ducts is mainly constituted by essential oils, polysaccharides and phenolic compounds (probably flavonoid aglycones), which led us to say that is a <b>gum-resin...</b>|$|E

Bhandari} {{is a large}} spinescent shrub to a small tree inhabiting drier parts of Western India, mainly Rajasthan and Gujarat. Its <b>gum-resin</b> contains Z and E guggulsterones and is used in Ayurvedic medicines as a remedy to reduce cholesterol, treatment of arthiritis and obesity. The populations of this species are declining sharply because of its extensive use in medicinal purpose. Though, C. wightii is assigned to the DD (Data Deficient) category ver. 2. 3 (1994) of the Red Data Book of IUCN, the Government of India has included it under RET (Rare, Endangered, Threatened) category. So information on the genetic identity and inter relationship of Commiphora genotypes is essential for proper conservation and utilization. The present investigation was undertaken using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) markers to study genetic relationships among 24 genotypes of C. wightii, collected {{from different parts of}} Rajasthan. A total of 60 RAPD primers and 27 ISSR primers were screened and based on degree of polymorphism, 16 RAPD and 16 ISSR primers were selected for the study. In RAPD analysis, a total of 105 amplicons were amplified, out of which 76 were polymorphic in nature however using ISSR markers, 80 polymorphic loci were observed from a total of 103 loci. The amplified products from both the analysis ranged from 230 to ? 3000 bp. In RAPD analysis, maximum number of amplicons was scored in primer OPN 20. Highest resolving power and primer index was observed in primer OPN 20 and OPN 06, respectively. In ISSR analysis, maximum number of polymorphic loci was amplified in (AG) 8 G whereas maximum primer resolving power and primer index was observed in (AC) 8 C and (CT) 8 G, respectively. Cluster analysis, using UPGMA, SHAN clustering (NTSYS-pc) grouped the genotypes into three main clusters which were further subdivided into six sub-clusters in RAPD analysis while ISSR showed four main clusters and nine sub-clusters. The genetic similarity among the genotypes varied from 0. 43 to 0. 97 when pooled RAPD and ISSR data were used. Hence the study showed existence of wide genetic variability within the species which is otherwise reported as apomictic species and opened the scope of selection of better genotype in relation to chemical data. These findings can also serve as guidelines to preserve the genetic resources of this important medicinal plant species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dry {{woodlands}} {{comprise the}} largest forest resources in Ethiopia. An {{important feature of}} these forests is their richness in Acacia, Boswellia and Commiphora (ABC) species that produce gum and resin. Gums/resins significantly contribute to rural livelihoods, the national economy, and ecosystem stability. Their contribution to local livelihoods {{is in terms of}} both cash income and subsistence value. In {{different parts of the country}} they contribute up to one-third of the annual household income. Currently, an estimated US 2 million gum and resin are consumed locally, the rest is exported. During the 2007 / 08 fiscal year, Ethiopia earned a revenue of about US. 7 million from this export. However, the woodlands and the ABC species are under intense pressure. Especially in the traditional production areas in north Ethiopia the pressure is high and the policies that were enacted to shape their use and management have not been very effective. The main objective of this study is to investigate how gum and resin utilization and management is carried out in the drylands of Ethiopia and what processes affect this. The following four questions were addressed: (i) What types of <b>gum-resin</b> woodland management and production systems are present in Ethiopia and how are they related to the land-use and socio-political conditions?, (ii) What dynamic processes in institutional arrangements and <b>gum-resin</b> production and management have occurred in various regions of Ethiopia?; (iii) How do multi-level formal and informal institutions interact and affect gum and resin production and management?, and (iv) How does gumresin utilization fits into the livelihoods strategies of households in the study areas? The study is based on a multi-theoretical approach giving attention to both diversity and dynamics in ABC woodlands production systems, institutional diversity and interaction regarding the governance of ABC resources, and the role of gum and resin in the livelihoods strategies of the households. The study design consisted of a comparative case study of three regions in north (Abergelle), northwest (Metema and Quara), and south Ethiopia (Borana). The three locations are characterized by ecological and socio-economic differences as well as a different history of gum and resin production. A two-phase research approach consisting of a base-line survey and a systematic household survey was used. The base-line survey served to assess the local socio-economic, institutional and land-use conditions; data were collected through open interviews with groups and key informants. The household survey served to obtain further detailed information on the ABC production conditions and the role of the products at household level. The survey included 327 respondents; it was follow-up by feedback meetings with groups of participants to check and validate the main issues that emerged from it. The qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group discussion were transcribed, categorized, and interpreted. The data from household survey was analysed using descriptive statistics and mean comparisons in SPSS. Chapter 2 discusses the diversity in gum and resin management and production systems and how different exploitation arrangements are related to different phases of resource domestication and/or degradation. Seven presently existing production models are identified. In south Ethiopia pastoral people mainly collect the products in the form of ooze from natural vegetation. In north Ethiopia the production is part of mixed farming practices or is done by externally hired laborers. Production is done by tapping wild trees. Despite decades of production history in this region, the species is not cultivated and hardly domesticated in an ecological or biological sense. The production systems gradually evolved from openaccess extraction of wild trees to a controlled production in assigned forest plots. This institutionalisation of access rules concerns a process of domestication in a social sense. However, this process is not yet very effective; the ABC woodlands are often subject to serious degradation as a result of competing land-use practices and inappropriate social arrangements for production and trade of the gums/resins. These findings show that the nature of domestication in a social sense determines whether forests and/or specific forest resources can be further domesticated in an ecological and biological sense resulting in intensified management and resource enrichment, or whether they are subject to degradation. Chapter 3 and 4 elaborate how gum and resin production is shaped in the different parts of Ethiopia by the location-specific interaction between formal and informal institutions. Chapter 3 discusses how gum and resin production and marketing in Borana is related to the interplay between well-established traditional land-use institutions and external institutions. Both the traditional and external institutions do not explicitly control access to the gum and resin production system, but under traditional conditions gum and resin extraction was embedded in a strong customary system for controlled pastoral land use. The traditional institutions did not developed rules and norms regulating market access. The external institutions impacted gum and resin production mainly by creating access to markets, but this has not yet had much impact on the actual exploitation arrangements. The woodlands are experiencing increasing pressure due to the increase in non-traditional and non-gum and resin based livelihoods activities that negatively affect ABC woodlands. Also, the traditional natural resources management institutions are weakened due to modernization processes and contribute at present little to sustainable use and management of <b>gum-resin</b> resources. This situation calls for either revitalizing the traditional range land management system, or generating institutions specific to ABC species that integrate the customary and external institutions. Chapter 4 discusses the nature and interactions of formal and informal institutions concerning the AB resource use and management in the north and northwest Ethiopia. Existing government regulations recognize gum and resin production and marketing by both smallholders, cooperatives, and companies. However, in practice gum and resin production and marketing by smallholders is restricted. This is the result of informal bureaucratic institutions that act as rules-in-use regarding gum and resin production and marketing regardless of whether they contradict with the regulations of federal and regional states. Moreover, the customary rules and practices and the sectoral government policies often compete with the formal regulations for ABC species use and management. The interaction between government regulations and informal institutions is generally competing; this often results in indiscriminate tree cutting and woodland conversion. The situation requires harmonization of the formal and informal institutions and coordination of institutions across sectors. Chapter 5 discusses the relationship between gum and resin production and the livelihood systems of local producers. Both the livelihoods systems and the contribution of the multiple activities to cash and total income vary among the study areas. In Borana the use of gum and resin is part of a predominantly pastoral livelihood system with gum and resin acting as supplementary cash crops or safety nets in times of emergency. In Abergelle the production fits into a diversification strategy with gum and resin exploitation forming a component of a mixed farming system. In Metema local farmers were not involved in gum and resin exploitation; here production is a specialized activity of commercial enterprises using laborers from outside the region. The findings show that not only the value of the ABC resources, but also the degree of the embeddedness of the product in multi-livelihoods strategies of the households as well as the institutional arrangements that govern production system and market access are important regarding how these products fit into the livelihoods strategies of the households. Chapter 6 brings all the information together and further assesses the nature of the different institutional arrangements for gum and resin exploitation, and their dynamics and interaction. It also elaborates the relation between the status of ABC resource domestication and their exploitation arrangements. The process of organizing gum and resin utilization followed different pathways in north and south Ethiopia. In the south it started as the collection of products for chewing gum for subsistence use; later it was marketed as a coping mechanism during periods of livelihood stress. In contrast to these endogenous developments, in the north the production was introduced by external private and state companies. Only gradually also some informal systems of private exploitation evolved. After 1990 cooperatives took over many of the concession areas of the commercial companies. This cooperative movement also was introduced in the south. As a result of these location-specific dynamics in organizing the production, six exploitation arrangements evolved. These arrangements differ with respect to whether their organization is companybased, cooperative-based or privately based, and are characterized by different rules and regulations regarding access to resources and markets, and the type of labor used for production. In all study areas the exploitation arrangements co-exist with a growing importance of the cooperative arrangements. The institutional arrangements are not conducive to stimulate intensification of production, rather they may limit local participation and endogenous development of informal and location-specific institutions. Moreover, the effectiveness of the exploitation arrangements may be limited as a result from competing development policies and programmes aimed at other land-use sectors. These findings further illustrate that the limited progress in ABCs domestication greatly depends on the nature of institutional arrangements for access to resources and markets, the relation of formal and informal institutional arrangements, and development polices. In chapter 7 it is concluded that the use and management of the ABC species in Ethiopia is very divers both in terms of production systems, institutional arrangements for exploitation, and roles in local livelihoods. The nature of location-specific production systems is greatly affected by the local system for ABC governance. Such a system involves complex set of both formal and informal institutions at both government level and local level. The informal institutions do not only include customary institutions of local communities, but also informal rules-in-use of local bureaucrats. The historic process of institutionalisation of ABC governance differs between regions. Depending on local land-use conditions and government policies, different exploitation arrangements have been developed based on either company, cooperative or private control over the production, labor and marketing. But despite of this diversified stage of domestication in a social sense, the production systems are still in an early phase of domestication in ecological and technical sense and intensified production through tree cultivation or plantation establishment has hardly been developed. Several gum and resin production systems are even subject to serious degradation due to the inappropriate nature of, and sometimes even competition between, the exploitation arrangements, as well as the economic position of the ABC resources in relation to other forms of land-use. The complex pattern of institutions governing the production of gum and resin also impacts on the role that the resources play in local livelihoods. Both the role of gum and resin production in the prevailing land-use conditions and the degree of control on market and resource access determine how the gum and resin fit into the livelihoods strategies of the households. As the governance of gum and resin production involves a complex, diverse and dynamic web of formal and informal institutions, it will not be effective to stimulate production as a means for both sustainable forest use and livelihood improvement by a generic development policy. Rather a diversified and regional-specific approach is needed that builds upon the location specific characteristics of the gum and resin production systems and exploitation arrangements.  ...|$|E
