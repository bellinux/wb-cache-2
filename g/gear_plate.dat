50|$|The Class FD was {{a heavier}} and more {{powerful}} version of the experimental Class FC which {{had been placed in}} service in 1925. It was the Modified Fairlie equivalent of the Class GD 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects, hence the Class FD designation of these Modified Fairlies. The FA and FB classifications were never used by the SAR. The Class FD locomotives had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> <b>plate</b> frames and were superheated. They proved to be powerful locomotives and good steamers, but they were less successful than their Garratt equivalent.|$|E

5000|$|Due {{to budget}} constraints, however, the Ralliart (codenamed [...] "TJ0R42") {{was brought to}} market in February 2002 still as an {{individually}} numbered vehicle, but only with a FWD platform and with less third party-sourced fittings. In fact, the front seats ended up being the standard Mitsubishi-designed Magna seats, but with revised side bolsters; the standard Magna's steering wheel and gear levers were retained, although the former was leather wrapped (black and red) in Italy by MOMO; the red-only instrument cluster dials (but with a [...] "Ralliart" [...] inscribed rev counter) and silver interior trims for the centre console and tunnel were sourced from the VR-X Limited Edition (without the Verada-sourced chrome <b>gear</b> <b>plate</b> for the automatic fitted to the VR-X). The sound system was a complete upgrade, however, being a 14-speaker Fujitsu Ten Eclipse tuner with CD player and remote control.

40|$|Machine {{remaining}} {{useful life}} (RUL) prediction is {{a key part of}} Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), which provides the time evolution of the fault indicator so that maintenance can be performed to avoid catastrophic failures. This paper proposes a new RUL prediction method based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and high-order particle filtering, which predicts the time evolution of the fault indicator and computes the probability density function (pdf) of RUL. The ANFIS is trained and integrated in a high-order particle filter to describe the fault propagation process; the high-order particle filter uses real-time data to update the current state estimates so as to improve the prediction accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated via the real-world data from a seeded fault test for a UH- 60 helicopter planetary <b>gear</b> <b>plate.</b> The results show that it outperforms the conventional ANFIS predictor. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recentry the {{fish-finder}} for {{tuna fishing}} {{has been developing}} {{and there are many}} reports on the echogram of fish-finder,recording the swiming depth of the fish and their density, by HASHIMOTO, NISHIMURA and MANIWA. In the tuna fishery, however, the fish-finder by ultrasonic wave has not been used so effective as in trawl and purse sein. For the study on the method of its field operation, the auther had some experiments with the fish-finder at Philippine Sea,in June and November 1962. The fish-finder wich where installed on M. S. NAGASAKIMARU, the fishery training vessel, Nagasaki Univ., 130 GT, has charactors shown inTabie 1. The one NEC 1620 type, was used for detecting tuna shoal, another 1600 type, for tracing the tuna longline under waterco ntribution. From these experiments,it was recognized that the fish-finder could sharply catch the reflaction from the fish and was very covenient for the study of their ecology. And from echograms that the ability of sounding capacity was about 8000 m by 13. 5 KC and 800 m by 200 KC under cruising by 9 knots on the slight or moderate sea,and detecting a sigle tuna (20 db, bcdy weight 35 kg) it was 250 m by 13. 5 KC (Fig. 2 & 3). The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1) Their typical echograms are shown in PLATE Ⅲ- 2. 3 and detecting area of tuna echosunder the above conditions is shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore,it was caluculated from Fig. 5 that the fish-finder could cover the conical volume, 108 m 3 per hour under cruising by 9 knots. 2) It was measured that the running ultrasonic noise was 40 db under cruising by 9 knots against the wind being 12 m/sec, and the reflection loss of yellow-fin tuna (B. W. 30 kg) was 22 db (Fig. 7). The single tuna, however, was recorded distinguishably as "Λ" on the paper which was filled with ultrasonic noise (PLATE Ⅲ- 2). As the result from analysis of those echograms, it was estimated that the tuna were in 40 - 200 m depth layer and most of them were in "resting state", and some-times a few of them moved with 1 - 5 knots reactively against the aproaching plancton net or fishing <b>gear.</b> (<b>PLATE</b> Ⅳ- 5, 6) ﻿ 3) Especially, {{the fact that there were}} no correlation between the density of their population and the daily catch per hook; will have a important point on the estimation of their population (Fig. 10, Table 3). 4) From the PLATE Ⅳ- 7,Ⅴ- 8, 9 shown the daily migration of D. S. L. and small fishes,it was observed that the small fish (less than about 10 kg in body weight) would be moving vertically with the migration of D. S. L [...] From the nacturnal echogram, it was shown that the D. S. L. contained small single fish from surface to 120 m depth, but a few large fisfes (more 10 kg body weight) were scattered from 100 to 200 m depth, and it was observed that D. S. L. began to dive suddenly with the speed of 200 - 400 m per hour at begining of morning twilight and it proceeded to dive until arriving at the 230 - 300 m or 550 - 700 m depth at half an hour after sunrise, but during the daytime it has no migration. And it was observed that in the evening, D. S. L. began to refroat toward 0 - 120 depth under the same speed as in morning diving, following with the small fish and a few large fishes...|$|E

40|$|The final {{research}} cruise {{described in}} this report had the objective to compare the physical and biological impact of the bottom trawl modifications developed during the EU DEGREE project to a standard bottom trawl used in the Barents Sea cod fisheries. The “new” trawl was fitted with the last modification of the <b>plate</b> <b>gear</b> developed during the project as well as trawl doors (standard Thyborøn doors) rigged to barely touch the bottom. The commercial trawl used for comparison was rigged with a conventional rockhopper ground gear and the doors were rigged to go heavy on the bottom as normally rigged during commercial bottom trawling. We looked for combinations enabling us to fish with the doors off, or nearly off, the bottom, while the ground gear was still on bottom and the door spread was maintained. This enabled almost no impact of the doors on the seabed while hopefully keeping an acceptable fishing efficiency for species not sensitive to herding effects of doors. More fishing experiments are therefore needed before it may be concluded that this rigging can be recommended for commercial use by the fishing fleet. The physical and biological impact on the bottom habitat of the two trawls was compared. Only two valid impact hauls was done with each trawl, both on very soft sediments. This is of course too few hauls to obtain a full statistical comparison between the two trawls. However, all parameters measured indicated that the <b>plate</b> <b>gear</b> trawl had a lower impact on the bottom substrate and benthic organisms than the conventional rockhopper trawl. The physical impact on the bottom was visually inspected and measured by ROV technique. Although the number of hauls was low, {{the results indicated that}} the rockhopper dug up more living material than the <b>plate</b> <b>gear.</b> This tendency was confirmed by the ROV investigations...|$|R

Two features based on the signal energy are used to distinguish the faulty from the healthy plate using the signals from four one-dimensional accelerometers. A data analysis based on the Time Synchronous Averaging signal transformation tends to indicate that the apart from any machining error or material fault that may have initiated the crack; there is evidence of a non-rotating fault, possibly on the ring gear, as well as a considerable non-uniform distribution of forces among the planet gears that may have been generated by the presence of the crack and or may have promoted its rapid development...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} uses of {{austempered}} steel was in rifle bolts during World War II. The high impact strength possible at high hardnesses, and the relatively small section size of the components made austempered steel ideal for this application. Over subsequent decades austempering revolutionized the spring industry followed by clips and clamps. These components, which are usually thin, formed parts, do not require expensive alloys and generally possess better elastic properties than their tempered Martensite counterparts. Eventually austempered steel made {{its way into the}} automotive industry where one of its first uses was in safety critical components. The majority of car seat brackets and seat belt components are made of austempered steel because of its high strength and ductility. [...] These properties allow it to absorb significantly more energy during a crash without the risk of brittle failure. Currently, austempered steel is also used in bearings, mower blades, transmission <b>gear,</b> wave <b>plate,</b> and turf aeration tines. [...] In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century the austempering process began to be applied commercially to cast irons. Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) was first commercialized in the early 1970s and has since become a major industry.|$|R
