50|$|PE files {{normally}} {{do not contain}} position-independent code. Instead they are compiled to a preferred base address, and all addresses emitted by the compiler/linker are fixed ahead of time. If a PE file cannot be loaded at its preferred address (because it's already taken by something else), the operating system will rebase it. This involves recalculating every absolute address and modifying the code {{to use the new}} values. The loader does this by comparing the preferred and actual load addresses, and calculating a delta value. This is then added to the preferred address {{to come up with the}} new address of the memory location. Base relocations are stored in a list and added, as needed, to an existing memory location. The resulting code is now private to the process and no longer shareable, so many of the memory saving benefits of DLLs are lost in this scenario. It also slows <b>down</b> <b>loading</b> of the module significantly. For this reason rebasing is to be avoided wherever possible, and the DLLs shipped by Microsoft have base addresses pre-computed so as not to overlap. In the no rebase case PE therefore has the advantage of very efficient code, but in the presence of rebasing the memory usage hit can be expensive. This contrasts with ELF which uses fully position-independent code and a global offset table, which trades off execution time against memory usage in favor of the latter.|$|E

30|$|Curved samples under {{compression}} load have a superior performance {{when compared to}} the samples subjected to tension load. In practice, entirely curved frame of one-piece type is subjected to {{compression load}}. The strengths of the frames of the one-piece type chairs are due to compressing load because the top to <b>down</b> <b>load</b> on the one-piece type chairs are performed as compressing load. As it is known, the top to <b>down</b> <b>load</b> on the one-piece type chairs is similar to the front to back load on the control samples. The strength of chair structures is obtained with the curved frames and the maximum load for various failure modes is different from custom chairs with solid wood. Therefore, deformation in wood is one of the important factors affecting the strength of chair frames. By comparing the maximum load of custom chair and other chairs, {{it was found that the}} front to back loads of chair on curved frames are estimated 1.5 times. The superior performance of chair with curved frames is due to the design type of the chair. The chair with new design type can also be suggested as shown in Fig.  14. Structural form and the radius of the curve are directly influential on the resistance characteristics and the amount of deflection [9]. Curved stretchers as shown in Fig.  14 can improve the strength of chairs. Suggested design of chair can improve the maximum load, especially for the top to <b>down</b> <b>load.</b>|$|R

40|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} load-following process, this paper presents large deflection, post-buckling analysis of the three-dimensional elastic frame from a dynamic point of view. A co-rotational formulation combined with small deflection beam theory with {{the inclusion of the}} effect of axial force is adopted. The pre-buckling analysis employs the constant arc length method together with the modified Newton-Raphson iteration method and the extrapolation technique to improve the convergence behaviour. As the limit state being examined is passed, the previous converged solution is adopted to start the nonlinear dynamic analysis, based on the average acceleration of the Newmark algorithm with a slow rate of load incrementation, to trace the load-deflection path beyond the limit point. As a result, the snap-through problem is overcome without <b>down</b> <b>loading.</b> The efficiency of the damping coefficients on the control of displacement overshooting and vibration, which are the common phenomena using this procedure under conventional structural damping, is also studied and applied to all the numerical examples. This study is demonstrated by application to typical three-dimensional frames which show snap-through behaviour in static analysis with any increment of load after the limit point...|$|E
