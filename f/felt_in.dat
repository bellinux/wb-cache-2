40|$|This paper {{argues that}} design can empower a craftsperson and {{accordingly}} provides {{the ability to}} maintain her work and practice. In addition, it can provide new opportunities to the local community she is part of. The study presents case studies {{from the field of}} <b>felting</b> <b>in</b> Turkey, the aim being to understand the field of <b>felting</b> <b>in</b> Turkey and the role of design in the transitioning of felting. Based on these findings, we argue that craftspeople who use design are more empowered: they can create their own craft identities, sustain their practice, and build productive relationships with the local community.

5|$|Tremors {{from the}} {{earthquake}} were also <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> eastern Canada, mostly in Southern Ontario, {{as well as}} in parts of southern Quebec and the Maritime provinces. In Ontario, a few buildings in Toronto were evacuated, and roads were closed as a precautionary measure in case of building collapse in Sudbury and Windsor. The year 2011 is the second consecutive year in which an earthquake was widely <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> Southern Ontario and Quebec, the previous being the June 2010 Central Canada earthquake that also affected that region.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its close}} {{proximity}} to islands along its path, Dovi caused only minimal damage. Oceanic swells and storm surge were <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> some coastal areas. Strong winds were reported in the southern Cook Islands and Niue. Damage to banana plantations on Palmerston Island was reported, but Dovi caused no fatalities.|$|E

5|$|In 1727, an {{underground}} fire {{was reported in}} nearby Hinxhill, while a larger earthquake struck the town on 1 June 1756. The 2007 Kent earthquake, which registered 4.3 on the Richter magnitude scale, was <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> Ashford, though its effects were greatest in Folkestone.|$|E
5|$|Linfa was {{originally}} forecast to move northwards and make landfall in Taiwan. However, Linfa curved {{to the west}} and hit Southern China instead. Only heavy rains and gusty winds were <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> Southern and Central Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|St Michael's Church was {{destroyed}} by an earthquake on 11 September 1275. According to the British Geological Survey, the earthquake was <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> London, Canterbury and Wales, and {{was reported to have}} destroyed many houses and churches in England. The force was greater than 7MSK, with its epicentre in the area around Portsmouth or Chichester, South England.|$|E

Sentinel means soldier posted to keep guard over a special place.|$|R

5|$|The Renaissance was a {{cultural}} movement that profoundly affected European intellectual {{life in the}} early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading {{to the rest of}} Europe by the 16th century, its influence was <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shock of}} the {{earthquake}} occurred at 0:16 GMT and was followed by several strong aftershocks. The quake was most widely <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> the Chinandega and León departments of Nicaragua, though it was also felt elsewhere in Nicaragua at El Crucero, Managua and San Marcos and at San José in Costa Rica. It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since the earthquake of 1972.|$|E
5|$|The {{spirit of}} peace and {{reconciliation}} established by the Dictum of Kenilworth lasted {{for the remainder of}} Henry III's reign and into the 1290s. In 1270, Prince Edward left the country to go on crusade in the Holy Land. When his father died in 1272, Edward <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> a safe enough position to wait until 1274 before returning home to claim the throne.|$|E

5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state. It {{was the strongest}} in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.|$|E
5|$|In 132, Zhang {{introduced}} an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal {{direction of a}} distant earthquake. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.|$|E
