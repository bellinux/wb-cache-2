By 1976 the company's main line had become <b>warning</b> <b>buzzers</b> for fire and security alarms.|$|R
25|$|The 1976 {{models were}} {{almost the same}} as their {{immediate}} predecessors; their differences were limited to a compression ratio increase for the 258 six from 7.6:1 to 8.0:1. New gauges appeared {{in the form of a}} 160km/h speedometer and revised warning lights, sunvisors were redesigned to larger more rectangular units with side bending portions, a new more-ornate dome light lens, new seat and side panel designs, while a rear defroster was added to the options. The separate seatbelts <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> between the wipers and lights knobs was discontinued. New full-rubber bumper guards became available alongside the already existing metal ones with rubber strips.|$|R
5000|$|The SACEM system {{enable a}} train to receive signals from devices under the tracks. A {{receiver}} in the train cabin interprets the signal, and sends data to the console so the driver can see it. A light on the console indicates the speed control setting: an orange light means [...] "Jog Mode", or 30 kph mph; a red light means full stop. If the driver alters the speed, a <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> may sound. If the system determines that the speed might be unsafe, and the driver does not change it within a few seconds, SACEM engages the emergency brake.|$|R

2500|$|The {{sedan and}} Limited wagon model were dropped, leaving the wagon {{as the only}} {{available}} version in 1988, its final season and now under Chrysler's ownership. The standard and only [...] I6 engine was rated at [...] and came with either a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission with AMC's Select-Drive system. Standard equipment in 1988 that was previously optional included air conditioning system, rear window defroster, halogen headlamps, AM/FM stereo radio, light group (glove box, dome, and engine lights), and adjustable steering wheel. The following remained optional equipment for the 1988 production: power windows, power seats, power mirrors, radio with cassette player, cruise control, rear window wiper, wood grain side panels, floor mats, headlamp <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer,</b> intermittent wipers, wire wheel covers, and a cold climate group.|$|R
50|$|In September 2004 for the 2005 model year, the FX range {{received}} enhancements such as {{lane departure warning}} (LDW) {{system that}} helps alert drivers to an unintended movement of the vehicle out of a designated traffic lane. Infiniti's system monitored the lane markings to alert passengers via an audible buzzer that the driver is drifting unintentionally. The LDW system, which utilize a small camera, speed sensor, an indicator and an audible <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer,</b> was offered on models. The Infiniti FX was the first passenger vehicle to offer a lane departure warning system in the United States market. In addition to LDW, the 2005 Infiniti FX range was now equipped with standard roof-mounted curtain supplemental curtain air bags with rollover protection for front and rear outboard seat occupants.|$|R
50|$|These {{versions}} of MLX shared a format consisting of six data bytes in decimal format, plus a seventh byte {{which served as}} a checksum. Although each line began with the memory address, and bytes were separated with commas, these {{did not have to}} be typed; the program auto-incremented the address and automatically printed the comma delimiters every three characters. Invalid keystrokes were filtered out. When a line was completely typed, it was automatically verified against the checksum value. If it matched, the user would be prompted for the next line. If not, a <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> would sound and the invalid input would be discarded so that the user could retype the line. Several keyboard keys were redefined to create a makeshift numeric keypad.|$|R

50|$|In North America, cars sold {{since the}} early 1970s have {{included}} an audiovisual reminder system consisting of a tell-tale light on the dashboard and a buzzer or chime reminding the driver and passengers to fasten their belts. Originally, these lights were accompanied by a <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> whenever the transmission was in any position except park if either the driver was not buckled up or, as determined by a pressure sensor in the passenger's seat, {{if there was a}} passenger there not buckled up. However, this was {{considered by many to be}} a major annoyance, as the light would be on and the buzzer would sound continuously if front-seat passengers were not buckled up. Therefore, people who did not wish to buckle up would defeat this system by fastening the seat belts with the seat empty and leaving them that way.|$|R
2500|$|The 1972 {{model year}} VAM models {{incorporated}} the same engineering revisions and upgrades of the U.S. market AMC-built counterparts. Engines {{were the same}} as the year before with a one-barrel 145hp 232 as standard on the sedans and automatic wagon and the two-barrel 155hp version for the manual wagon. All featured a front sway bar as standard equipment. The 1972 models also included a new plastic grille with a revised hood latch, along with a new tail light design with larger backup lights, a new optional wheel cover design, a third AM radio model (shared with the VAM Javelin), and new interior door panels with a wood imitation rectangular portion. This was also {{the first year of the}} seatbelt <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> located above the light and wiper knobs.

Introduced at a base price of Rs. 3.06 Lakh, the next gen Alto K10 comes with multiple exterior and interiors updates, however mechanically it remains same. The car is a somewhat upgraded version of the Alto 800 with a new front fascia comprising a new chrome fitted front grille, new swept back headlamps, and a redesigned bonnet line. There are also amendments for tail lights, restructuring of bumpers, 13 inch wheels, ORVMs, door moulding and some other minor modifications. Interiors too have been updated, with a new dashboard, three-spoke steering wheel, refined upholstery, black finished music system and a better looking instrument cluster. Other added features inside the car include front power windows, 12 V power socket, internally adjustable ORVMs, headlamp <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer,</b> key off reminder and gearshift indicator.|$|R

5000|$|A popular club in Windsor {{frequented by}} wealthy Detroiters was Edgewater Thomas Inn, owned by former Detroiter, Bertha Thomas. It had highly paid dock and parking attendants {{who served as}} lookouts, {{instructed}} to push {{one of the many}} <b>warning</b> <b>buzzers</b> located every 20 feet around the property. Once pushed, flashing lights and sirens would sound for five seconds inside the inn's bar and dining rooms. In July 1929, Windsor's Border Cities Star reported that on their 110th raid of the inn, police finally found four cases of strong beer and Bertha Thomas was arrested. The [...] "Riverfront's Leading Hostess" [...] endured over 2,000 raids during prohibition (ending in 1933) but continued running her business until her death in 1955. Today, the Windsor Yacht Club is located on the land of the former Edgewater Thomas Inn. The street opposite is named Bertha in her honor, and Thomas Avenue is east of that, where she owned farmland.|$|R
50|$|Debuted on {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Lexus LS, the next-generation Pre-Crash System (Pre-Collision in the U.S.) offers forward and rear protection. The Frontal Pre-Crash system will activate a <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> and red dash lights to alert the driver if a potential hazard is detected in the vehicle's path. If the system detects a potential collision, the system will adjust steering and braking responsiveness. If a collision is determined to be unavoidable, the seatbelt pretensioners will activate, and the brakes will automatically engage to slow the vehicle. The Rear Pre-Crash system, the first active rear collision safety feature in an automobile, utilizes trunk-mounted obstacle detection and warning systems; if a rear collision is deemed unavoidable, sensor-equipped Pre-Crash Intelligent Headrests in the front seats will adjust position upwards up to 25 mm and forwards up to 60 mm to cradle the head during impact, reducing whiplash. The rear Pre-Crash system in the U.S. market waited for FCC regulatory approval. For 2010, the LS hybrid further incorporated an all-TFT instrument panel display, which featured {{the addition of a}} night vision capability with pedestrian detection.|$|R
5000|$|For 1969, the Monterey's {{wheelbase}} grew to 124 inches (315 cm) inches {{with the}} exception of the station wagon which was on the 122 inches (309.9 cm) Ford wheelbase - it was essentially a Ford wagon with a Mercury front clip and trimwork. [...] The redesigned Mercurys were intended to emulate the Lincoln Continental. Minor changes differentiated the 1970 models, but a restyle for 1971 resulted in rounded and more flowing bodywork, beaked grilles, flipper exterior doorhandles, frameless windows on all sedans, wider c-pillars and fender skirts on all but the base Monterey and wagons. The convertible bodystyle for both the Monterey and the Marquis was eliminated and replaced by the new, costly and very rare optional power moonroof which was first made available on a Mercury with the 1968 Cougar. 1972 brought minor changes to Monterey and Marquis, such as eggcrate grilles and a front seatbelt <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer.</b> Also, SelectShift Cruise-O-Matic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes became standard equipment on all Monterey models for 1972.|$|R
50|$|The Skyride {{does not}} run in winds {{exceeding}} 25 mi/h km/h. High winds can push against the cars hard {{enough that the}} cable could fall off a tower. If this did happen, safety devices on the tower would stop the cable and the counterweight would keep the cable from falling {{all the way to}} the ground. For the same reason, passengers are prohibited from shaking the cars. One of the towers is fitted with an anemometer. When the wind speed reaches 20 mi/h km/h, a <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> sounds in the Fantasy Forest station. When the wind speed reaches 25 mi/h km/h, both cables automatically stop. At this point, the ride must be unloaded and closed, and must remain closed until one hour has passed without the wind reaching 25 mi/h km/h. It is also closed for any thunderstorm or other severe weather. It will normally be one of the first rides to close when severe weather is approaching the park, and one of the last rides to reopen once the severe weather passes. The cable for each side is usually replaced every ten years.|$|R
5000|$|John McCain flies his jet from {{a carrier}} on a bombing mission over Hanoi, North Vietnam. As a <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer</b> announces {{incoming}} missiles, McCain stays with the bomb drop, but is {{hit by a}} missile. He lands {{in the water and}} is pulled ashore by an angry mob, and taken prisoner. Asked to give information, he gives out the names of a sports team rather than of his squadron. In flashbacks, his father tells of how his submarine escaped destruction in World War II, and told him not to worry about his grades, as his father and grandfather [...] "really fooled them" [...] by rising to admiral despite doing poorly in school. In prison, McCain sees other prisoners cruelly tortured, while he sees a couple who appear to have decided to cooperate with the enemy. McCain is given a choice to be released early in recognition that his father is commander of US forces in the Pacific, but he refuses, and suffers for it. During a stepped-up bombing campaign, the prisoners sing [...] "Silent Night", after which negotiations result in a release of prisoners and a trip home.|$|R
2500|$|The Mk.III's final {{production}} year (1970) saw {{a set of}} exterior changes that included: [...] Addition of an integrated reverse/plate illumination lamp assembly on the rear, addition of full side lamps at {{the front and rear}} and new badging. [...] The separate [...] "TRIUMPH" [...] letters {{on the front of the}} bonnet were removed and [...] "TRIUMPH" [...] and [...] "SPITFIRE" [...] rectangular badges were used in the front, rear sides and rear. [...] A limited number of U.S. market 1970's were adorned with an RAF style [...] "SPITFIRE" [...] badge (U.K. models had a plain badge without the RAF roundel) that rested in the right corner (car opposing point of view) of the bonnet. Additional exterior changes introduced included a zip up rear window, black radiator grille and a black (vs body colored) windshield surround. [...] Full wheel covers of two styles were used including the 1969 introduced model with [...] "SPITFIRE" [...] circumscribing the hub and a unique derivative without the branding. [...] Interior changes included a steering column mounted ignition switch, a key-in-ignition <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer,</b> driver's side under-dash courtesy lamp and a new black spoked steering wheel. [...] Under the bonnet, some markets had the twin SU carburettors replaced with a single Zenith-Stromberg carburettor.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968 grilles had {{an insert}} with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the {{rectangular}} parking lights {{just a little}} higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The most obvious change was an 8.5-inch-longer hood designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which now came with three speeds standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer.</b> The DeVille also gained a new [...] V8 engine rated at 375 hp (SAE gross). 1968 was also {{the last year for}} the [...] "stacked" [...] dual headlights, which were replaced with side-by-side dual headlights in 1969. This was also the last year for vent windows. Side marker lights in the rear bumper as well asfront fender were also added. Side mirror changed from a round to rectangular shape.Also of note front disc brakes were available starting in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|... 1974: Five-mph bumpers {{added to}} the rear. Mostly {{carryover}} from the 1973 model year. Mid-year, a non-woodgrain LTD wagon became available. A new Federal law required seat belts to be buckled before the starter would operate; public protests prompted the government to relax this requirement. [...] Subsequent models got a simple [...] "Fasten Seat Belt" [...] <b>warning</b> light and <b>buzzer</b> for 1975, and owners were now permitted to disable the starter interlock on their '74s.|$|R
2500|$|... 1977 saw the {{steering}} column repositioned [...] {{closer to the}} dashboard to allow a more [...] "arms out" [...] position for the driver. The custom interior with leather seat trim was now standard, with cloth and leather a no-cost option. A redesigned center console permitted universal Delco radio options. One consequence of this modification was that an 8-track tape player was now available as an option. Auxiliary gauges were restyled and the ammeter was replaced with a voltmeter. The sun visors were redesigned to swivel so as to provide some glare protection from the side {{as well as the}} front. Chevrolet responded to the criticism of the previous year’s steering wheel with an all new three-spoke leather-wrapped unit, which was well received. Chevrolet featured this new wheel prominently on the front of their new Corvette sales brochure. The new wheel came on all cars fitted with the optional tilt-telescopic steering column which was ordered on all but a few thousand Corvettes. Corvette's refinement as a touring sports car continued as both power steering and power brakes became standard and new options included body-colored sport mirrors, cruise control, and a new convenience group. Cruise control was only available on cars with automatic transmissions. The convenience group included dome light delay, headlight <b>warning</b> <b>buzzer,</b> underhood light, low fuel warning light, interior courtesy lights, and passenger side visor mirror. The black exterior paint color returned (last offered in 1969). Unchanged was the horsepower ratings for both base and L-82 engines. Early in production, the engine paint color was changed from Chevy orange to Corporate blue. The “Stingray” script, seen on front fenders since 1969 disappeared, but new cross-flags emblems began appearing on fenders before the model year ended. Windshield posts were now painted black for a “thin pillar” look and this was the final year of the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] tunneled roof-line and vertical back window. A Corvette milestone was reached during 1977 as Chevrolet had built a half million Corvettes since production began in 1953.|$|R
40|$|Four pigeons {{were trained}} in a one-way shuttle box {{avoidance}} situation. Three of the birds met the criterion of 90 % avoidances; the fourth, although frequently avoiding successfully, was too erratic to meet the criterion. Avoidance responding {{in two of the}} birds was subsequently extinguished, showing that the response was true avoidance, and not escape from the <b>buzzer</b> <b>warning</b> stimulus. In Experiment 2, the three birds that had met criterion in Experiment 1 {{were trained in}} a two-way avoidance task, and all three met the criterion of 90 % avoidances. The shuttle box therefore provides a rapid and reliable method of obtaining avoidance performance in pigeons...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a cycle timer which enables the accurate following and repetition of SAE driving schedules of {{stop and go}} cycles, for electric vehicles, by reducing the human factor. The system which consists of a programmable read-only memory (PROM) stores each of these cycles, which are detailed, on its own plug-in card. The actual vehicle speed, and the PROM indicated desired speed are displayed on a dual scale meter allowing the driver to match them. A speed change is preceded by a half second <b>buzzer</b> <b>warning</b> and a new cycle by a one second warning. The PROM controls the recycle start {{time as well as}} the buzzer activation. A 5 volt regulator providing logic power, and a 12 volt dc-dc converter providing analog and memory power are described...|$|R
50|$|In most {{locomotives}} (in {{addition to}} a <b>warning</b> lamp or <b>buzzer</b> being sounded) the master controller undergoes auto-regression, with the notches falling to zero rapidly as the locomotive's motive power is switched off. The guard may also notice the loss of brake pressure (although he/she may not know it {{is due to the}} pulling of the alarm chain) and is expected to apply their brakes immediately as well. It is possible for a driver to override the alarm-chain pull; this is done where it is known that miscreants resort to pulling the emergency chain solely to get the train to stop at a point convenient for themselves. However, such an act by the driver (or guard) of deliberately ignoring an indication of alarm-chain pulling is a serious matter.|$|R
50|$|The MGB {{initially}} had {{an extremely}} simple electrical system. Dash-mounted toggle switches controlled the lights, ventilation fan, and wipers {{with only the}} direction indicators being mounted on a stalk on the steering column. The ignition switch was also mounted on the dash. Like the MGA, the MGB utilized two 6-volt batteries wired in series to give a 12-volt positive earth configuration. The batteries were placed under a scuttle panel behind the seats making access difficult; the location gave excellent weight distribution and thus improved handling. The charging system used a Lucas dynamo. Later MGBs had considerable changes to the electrical system {{including the use of}} a single 12-volt battery, a change from positive to negative earth, safety-type toggle (rocker) switches, alternator in lieu of dynamo, additional <b>warning</b> lights and <b>buzzers,</b> and most common functions moved to steering column stalks.|$|R
40|$|Key words: {{early fall}} alarm; {{inertial}} sensor; threshold algorithm Abstract. Falls are the second {{leading cause of}} unintentional injury deaths worldwide, so how to prevent falls has become a safety and security problem for elderly people. At present, because the sensing modules of most fall alarm devices generally only integrate the single 3 -axis accelerometer, so the measured accuracy of sensing signals is limited. It results in that these devices can only achieve the alarm of post-fall detection but not the early pre-impact fall recognition in real fall applications. Therefore, this paper aimed to develop an early pre-impact fall alarm system based on high-precision inertial sensing units. A multi-modality sensing module embedded fall detection algorithm was developed for early pre-impact fall detection. The module included a 3 -axis accelerometer, a 3 -axis gyroscope and a 3 -axis magnetometer, which could arouse the information of early pre-impact fall <b>warning</b> by a <b>buzzer</b> and a vibrator. Total 81 times fall experiments from 9 healthy subjects were conducted in simulated fall conditions. By combination of the early warning threshold algorithm, the result shows that the detection sensitivity can achieve 98. 61 % with a specificity of 98. 61 %, and the average pre-impact lead time is 300 ms. In the future, GPS, GSM electronic modules and wearable protected airbag will be embedded in the system, which will enhance the real-time fall protection and timely immediate aid immensely for the elderly people. 1...|$|R
