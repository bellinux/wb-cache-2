5|$|The Giants {{had another}} losing season in 1996, {{finishing}} 6–10. Though Brown again started every {{game for the}} Giants, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> {{one of the worst}} seasons of any starting quarterback in the NFL, throwing for just 12 touchdowns against 20 interceptions. The Giants' offense {{was one of the worst}} in the NFL and, unlike in previous years, the defense was unable to carry the team. After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, Reeves was fired.|$|E

After having one playoff appearance in four years, Reeves was dismissed after the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|Hipper {{set sail}} on 15 December for another raid and {{successfully}} bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet {{in the early}} morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.|$|E

5|$|Riegels did play, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> {{a stellar}} second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed {{for a touchdown}} and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E
5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief {{dates back to}} 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a third draft in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although he appeared to be carrying an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments (see below).|$|E

5|$|PFC Guy Gabaldon (1926–2006) went to {{live with}} the parents of his Japanese-American friend at the age of 12. At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, his adoptive family was placed in a relocation camp. Gabaldon joined the Marines when he was only 17 years old; he was a Private First Class (PFC) when his unit was engaged in the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Gabaldon, who acted as the Japanese interpreter for the Second Marines, working alone in front of the lines, entered enemy caves, pillboxes, buildings, and jungle brush, frequently in the face of hostile fire, and succeeded in not only obtaining vital military information, but in convincing well over 1,000 enemy soldiers and civilians to surrender. He was nominated for the Medal of Honor, but was awarded the Silver Star instead. His medal was later upgraded to the Navy Cross. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> more enemy soldiers than Sergeant Alvin York, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I for having captured 132 enemy German soldiers. Gabaldon's actions on Saipan were later memorialized in the film Hell to Eternity, in which he was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Hunter.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 2013, Benzema scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} France {{national}} team since June 2012 in a friendly against Australia, thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home Franck Ribéry's left-wing cross. In the second leg of the 2014 World Cup qualification play-off against Ukraine held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off Mathieu Valbuena's chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian goal-line. Ukraine had won {{the first leg of}} the play-off 2–0 in Kiev just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.|$|E

25|$|In March 2007 <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> an {{impressive}} 10–5 score but he struggled again in May 2007, only managing three wins at {{the rank of}} maegashira 2. After another losing score in July of that year he fell to maegashira 12 in September, his lowest-ever top-division rank. He managed nine wins in November 2007, his first kachi-koshi, or winning score, since March.|$|E
25|$|In a one-off match {{outside of}} Glory in Trieste on March 2, 2013, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> an uncharacteristically {{aggressive}} performance against Ole Laursen as he dropped Laursen {{with a knee}} to the liver before knocking him out with a high kick immediately after, leaving the outmatched Dane unconscious on the canvas for several minutes. This was Petrosyan's his first legitimate stoppage win in three years.|$|E
25|$|Two matches later, against Hampshire, Bannister enjoyed {{what was}} to remain his best bowling performance, when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> an {{outstanding}} innings analysis of 20.4-8-29-7; 1900 was the first year in which six-ball overs were used in England. Another excellent effort came in August, when he took five wickets in each innings (his only ten-wicket match haul) against Kent, despite his county slipping to a 231-run defeat. Bannister ended the season with 65 wickets at 20.47 to top the county's bowling averages.|$|E

25|$|For {{the early}} part of his career, Carter was {{somewhat}} overshadowed by his more illustrious teammates Len Coldwell and Jack Flavell, but nevertheless managed to make many appearances, especially when his England teammates were injured or engaged on Test duties. In 1965, the year in which he was capped, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a remarkable performance against Lancashire. Having come into the team in place of Coldwell, who had been injured, in the second innings Carter returned an analysis of 4.1–2–7–6, including a hat-trick, as Lancashire were dismissed for 55.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland's {{campaigns in}} 1959 and 1960 were {{noteworthy}} for Brown's league-leading rushing totals in both seasons. Plum became established {{as the starting}} quarterback, bringing a measure of stability to the squad not seen since Graham's retirement. The Penn State product led the team to a 7–5 record in 1959, and one year later, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> {{one of the greatest}} statistical seasons at his position in NFL history. Nonetheless, in 1960, the Browns dropped three games by a total of 10 points, finished with an 8–3–1 record and out of the playoffs for the second consecutive season.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007 <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> {{a strong}} 11–4 record and derailed Kotomitsuki's {{hopes of a}} tournament {{championship}} {{on the final day}} by slapping him down. This earned him promotion back to komusubi for September 2007. Kisenosato defeated Asashōryū once again in the yokozunas comeback tournament in January 2008, earning him his first kinboshi or gold star, (his first win over Asashōryū had been at komusubi rank so he was ineligible then) and his second Outstanding Performance Prize. Returning to komusubi in the March 2008 tournament, he lost to Asashōryū on the opening day but defeated three out of four ōzeki and held his rank with an 8–7 score.|$|E

25|$|Valthaty had {{a nondescript}} career till then, since {{making his way}} up the levels of age group cricket in Mumbai during the late 1990s. He made India's Under-19 squad to the 2002 World Cup in New Zealand with the likes of Irfan Pathan and Parthiv Patel where an injury to his eye in the game against Bangladesh halted his development. He couldn't make the {{breakthrough}} into senior cricket for years, and got just one opportunity for Mumbai, a one-dayer in 2006. There was no high-profile cricket for him for another few years, till Rajasthan Royals punted on him in the 2009 season, where he played a couple of matches. That earned him a place in Mumbai's Twenty20 side, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a few powerful performances for them, which led to a contract with Kings XI Punjab in 2011.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 2006, Rosie Malek-Yonan, {{was invited}} to testify on Capitol Hill before a Congressional Committee of the 109th Congress on {{religious}} freedom regarding the genocide, massacres and persecution of Assyrians in Iraq {{since the beginning of}} the 2003 Iraq War. Reading from her book, she compared the Assyrian Genocide of 1914-1918, as depicted in The Crimson Field, to the current plight of the indigenous Assyrian Christians in Iraq. Her 30-minute testimony and plea to the U.S. government, ultimately prompted Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) to travel to war-torn Iraq to witness matters for himself. While in Iraq, after meeting with local Assyrians, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> Malek-Yonan's in depth report to U.S. Officials in Iraq. One year later, a Congressional appropriations subcommittee voted to send $10 million to aid the Assyrians in Iraq. The complete archived transcript and webcast of the actual Congressional Testimony is available at the website of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{expected}} Konishiki to quickly make his push for yokozuna promotion. His stablemaster, the 46th Yokozuna Asashio Tarō III had predicted Konishiki would {{reach the top}} rank by his 25th birthday. However, his increasing weight caused a strain on his knee, exacerbated by previous high-school football injuries, which badly affected his performances. After a string of mediocre 8–7 scores <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a disastrous 3–12 in September 1988. His problems continued in 1989 and a 5–10 mark in September left him in danger of demotion from ōzeki once again. He made a spectacular comeback in November 1989, taking his first tournament championship with a 14–1 record. He was the first foreigner to win a top division title since Takamiyama in 1972. In March 1990 he {{took part in a}} three-way playoff for the title but he was outshone by Asahifuji, who earned promotion to yokozuna in July. In May 1991 Konishiki won 14 consecutive bouts but was beaten in a playoff on the final day by Asahifuji.|$|E
