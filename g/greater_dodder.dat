5000|$|The two <b>greatest</b> <b>Dodder</b> floods before 1986 {{occurred}} on 25 August 1905, and on 3 and 4 August 1931. Hurricane Charley (often spelled [...] "Charlie" [...] in Ireland) passed {{south of the}} country on 25 August 1986. In 24 hours, 200mm (almost 8 inches) of rain poured down on Kippure Mountain while 100mm fell on Dublin causing heavy river flooding, including the Dodder in many places, and hardship and loss were experienced.|$|R

50|$|The local Wildlife Trust has a fifteen-acre {{nature reserve}} at Collyweston Quarries where Lincolnshire {{limestone}} was quarried, {{to the north}} of the A43. This has the pyramidal orchid, common <b>dodder,</b> <b>greater</b> knapweed, common rock-rose, common bird's foot trefoil, and clustered bellflower. Birds found there include the European green woodpecker and glowworms are found there in the summer.|$|R
50|$|The CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois also {{studies the}} garden dormouse, in {{partnership}} with , and the <b>greater</b> <b>dodder</b> plant, which is exceptionally rare at the regional level.|$|E
50|$|The {{other two}} SSSIs, Great Haldon Heaths and Little Haldon Heaths, {{consist of a}} lowland heath habitat of a type only found in south west England. The Devon Whitebeam (Sorbus devoniensis) is common on Little Haldon Heaths, and the rare Climbing Corydalis (Corydalis claviculata) and the {{parasitic}} <b>Greater</b> <b>Dodder</b> (Cuscuta europaea) are also found here.|$|E
50|$|Cuscuta europaea, the <b>greater</b> <b>dodder</b> or European dodder, is a {{parasitic}} plant native to Europe, which {{belongs to the}} family Convolvulaceae, but was formerly classified in the family Cuscutaceae. It grows on Asteraceae, Cannabaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, Urticaceae and other herbaceous plants, including garden plants such as Coleus and Impatiens. It is a notable parasite of lucerne (Medicago sativa).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Presentation date: 2000 - 04 - 26 Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in 1998 and 1999, to evaluate glyphosate and glufosinate for control of redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, hairy nightshade, and barnyardgrass in herbicide-resistant sugarbeets. Treatments that included two or three applications of glyphosate, regardless of rate, or glyphosate applied once in combination with BAS 656 07 H or ethofumesate, resulted in 83 to 100 percent redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters and hairy nightshade control. Redroot pigweed and barnyardgrass control was lower when glyphosate was applied to cotyledon sugarbeets, with sequential applications one and two weeks later, than when glyphosate was applied to two to four leaf sugarbeets. Sugarbeet yield with glyphosate treatments was {{greater than or equal}} to the standard herbicide program used in sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied earlypostemergence or mid-postemergence resulted in 78 to 100 percent redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, and hairy nightshade control. Glufosinate following ethofumesate applied preplant incorporated or ethofumesate applied postemergence in combination with glufosinate provided weed control similar to the standard herbicide program. Barnyardgrass control was lowest with glufosinate applied postemergence in combination with ethofumesate. Glufosinate treatments that were applied in combination with ethofumesate postemergence resulted in lower sugarbeet yields. Slight sugarbeet injury was observed early in the growing season when ethofumesate was applied postemergence. However, weed control was the main factor that affected sugarbeet yield. Treatments did not affect sugarbeet sucrose content. Field dodder control, with glyphosate, ranged from 98 to 100 percent, 42 days after treatment. Glyphosate treatments reduced dodder dry weight compared to a conventional, herbicide program of the commercial premix of desmedipham and phenmedipham, tank mixed with triflusulfuron, and clopyralid. Sugarbeet dry weight was <b>greater,</b> and <b>dodder</b> dry weight was lower with the conventional program compared to the untreated control and a single application of glufosinate. Three applications of glufosinate, at 0. 40 and 0. 80 kg ai/ha with 3. 4 kg ai/ha of AMS resulted in a lower dodder dry weight than three applications of glufosinate at 0. 30 kg/ha with AMS and the untreated control. Glyphosate reduced dodder growth in some cases when applied before dodder attachment to glyphosate-resistant sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied before attachment to glufosinate-resistant sugarbeets had no effect on dodder growth. Dipping a single leaf from a dodder infested sugarbeet in a glyphosate solution reduced the growth of dodder that was attached to other sugarbeet leaves on the same plant. Since glyphosate was not in contact with dodder surface, the glyphosate that caused the dodder growth reduction translocated from the treated leaf to the leaves in which dodder was attached...|$|R
50|$|Nationally {{rare species}} {{supported}} include <b>greater</b> <b>dodder</b> which parasitises nettle. There is also tastless water-pepper, small water pepper, mudwort and needle spike rush. This {{is the only}} known site in Gloucestershire for small water pepper, mudwort and needle spike rush. Narrow-leaved water plantain, keeled barlic (Allium carinatus), glaucous bulrush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) and sea club rush (Scirpus maritimus) are also recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Fuller {{information}} for Coombe Hill Canal (...) {{is provided in}} the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. It is a 20.16 ha site overall (standing water, canals, fen, marsh and swamp lowland). The clearance work has been beneficial to aquatic and bankside plants. Flourishing uncommon species include fine-leaved water-dropwort, common meadow-rue and cyperus sedge. Also recorded are purple-loosestrife, yellow iris and skullcap. The management of nettles preserves a colony of the parasitic <b>greater</b> <b>dodder.</b>|$|E
50|$|No {{inventory}} of aquatic plants has been made, but <b>greater</b> <b>dodder</b> {{has been documented}} around the Lunda Industrial Area. No rare species of bottom fauna were found during an inventory in 1999, the stream being quantitatively dominated by a few species. Noteworthy is the gastropod Valvata piscinalis found near the residential area BÃ¤llsta. The stream is, nonetheless, important for various birds, including black-headed gull, common gull, lesser black-backed gull, herring gull, and Slavonian grebe reported at Hjulsta Water Park. As stretches of the watercourse remain ice-free during winters, it attracts ducks and teal, which have both been spending winters here.|$|E
