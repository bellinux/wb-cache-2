This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care.

40|$|Background: <b>Health</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{are divided}} {{in two parts}} {{of public and private}} <b>health</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Public <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> contain social {{security}} spending, taxing to private and public sectors, and foreign resources like loans and subventions.

The present study aims to compare the effects of these <b>expenditures</b> on <b>health</b> in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Methods: In this study, infant mortality rate was considered as an indicator of health status. We estimated the model using the panel data of EMR countries between 1995 and 2010. First, we used Pesaran CD test followed by Pesaran’s CADF unit root test. After the confirmation of having unit root, we used Westerlund panel cointegration test and found that the model was cointegrated and then after using Hausman and Breusch-Pagan tests, we estimated the model using the random effects. Results: The results showed that the public <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> had a strong negative relationship with infant mortality rate. However, a positive relationship was found between the private <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> and infant mortality rate (IMR). The relationship for public <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> was significant, but for private <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> was not.

25|$|The {{inadequate}} {{control of}} tuberculosis {{can be linked}} to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds drug-resistant tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Costa Rica {{has been}} cited in various {{journals}} as Central America's great health success story. Its healthcare system is ranked {{higher than that of}} the United States, despite having a fraction of its GDP. Prior to 1940, government hospitals and charities provided most health care. But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social – CCSS), Costa Rica has provided universal health care to its wage-earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (Programa de Salud Rural) for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total <b>health</b> <b>expenditure).</b> About 7% of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded.|$|E

More money was also allocated to hospitals treating the mentally ill. In addition, a Sports Council was set up to improve facilities. Direct government expenditure on sports more than doubled from £0.9 million in 1964/65 to £2 million in 1967/68, while 11 regional Sports Councils had been set up by 1968. In Wales, five new health centres had been opened by 1968, whereas none had been opened from 1951 to 1964, while spending on health and welfare services in the region went up from £55.8 million in 1963/64 to £83.9 million in 1967/68.|$|E
