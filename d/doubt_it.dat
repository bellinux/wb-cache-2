5|$|Rock Steady is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band No <b>Doubt.</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} on December 11, 2001, by Interscope Records. The band began writing the album with initial recording sessions in Los Angeles and San Francisco, then traveled to London and Jamaica to work with various performers, songwriters, and producers. Sly & Robbie, The Neptunes, and William Orbit were among the many artists the band collaborated with on the album.|$|E
5|$|The event which devastated {{areas from}} Montgomery to Greene County caused $20,000,000 in damage and injured 20 people. While the Storm Prediction Center {{archives}} {{say that it}} was a single tornado, it was likely three or more tornadoes, each producing F3 to F4 damage. Only damage near Schoharie was at the F4 level, and some sources <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> even reached that intensity at all.|$|E
25|$|After President Jimmy Carter {{pulled the}} U.S. team {{out of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics, NBC {{canceled}} a planned 150 hours of coverage (which had cost $87 million for the broadcast rights), placing the network's future in <b>doubt.</b> <b>It</b> had been counting on the broadcasts to help promote its new fall shows, and had been estimated to pull in $170 million in advertising revenue.|$|E

25|$|Provide {{evidence}} that the Holocaust happened, with a specific focus on the evidence for: the existence and use of gas chambers; and a co-ordinated Nazi plan, directed by Hitler, for the extermination of Jews. The goal was not to prove the holocaust, but to show that any reasonable and fair-minded historian would not <b>doubt</b> <b>it,</b> and that Irving must therefore not be reasonable or fair-minded.|$|E
25|$|Eugénie Glaisette {{married the}} civil {{engineer}} François Avril {{in a civil}} ceremony in May 1900 when she was aged 45. They lived at 1 avenue Malakoff (now avenue Raymond Poincaré) in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, in an apartment overlooking the place du Trocadéro. The marriage did nothing to reduce her activism. No <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> was due to her husband {{that she was able}} to hold several feminist meetings in the Civil Engineers premises at 19 rue Blanche.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} human sacrifice in the Indian subcontinent {{dates back to}} the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. An Indus seal from Harappa depicts the upside-down nude female figure with legs outspread and a plant issuing from her womb. The reverse side of the seal depicts a man holding a sickle and a woman seated on the ground in a posture of prayer. Many scholars interpret this scene as a human sacrifice in honor of the Mother-Goddess, although many historians <b>doubt</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Experimental and {{epidemiological}} data currently {{do not support}} the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer. However, this is under increasing <b>doubt.</b> <b>It</b> is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person's cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6–1.8%. The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved. CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{mentions}} of Slindon in 1745 or 1746 and Newland can {{be found}} playing for All-England or leading his own team, usually in opposition to Colchin's team. In July 1745, he scored {{what was then a}} massive 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings and it may have been his match total but, giving him the benefit of the <b>doubt,</b> <b>it</b> is the highest individual innings recorded during cricket's pioneering period (i.e., to 1763).|$|E
25|$|The Treehouse Village: The {{people of}} this village believe that strange occurrences will befall them if they don't live high in tree tops. This is {{also a part of}} the green belt that runs through the fairy world. It is all part of Aeval’s plant network. Though others may <b>doubt</b> <b>it,</b> Aeval always knew that the trees saw and remembered everything. Over time they have been used to hide treasures and secrets. In The Book of Air, someone within the fairy world has turned the trees to gold, keeping them from “speaking” with Aeval. The trees are being used to protect a key – the very key the Clockmaker needs to fix his Time Synchronization Machine. Lyra must help the trees in order for the trees to help Lyra.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, a Jewish {{group called}} Nakam {{formulated}} several plans to kill Germans in revenge for the Holocaust. Nakam's leader Abba Kovner, a former Lithuanian partisan, {{testified that he}} had approached Weizmann (at that time, President of the World Zionist Organization) with plans for a mass poisoning and that Wiezmann had put him {{in touch with a}} chemist who arranged for a quantity of poison to be procured. According to the story, Kovner did not tell Weizmann of his intention to poison millions of Germans via their water supply, but only of the backup plan to poison SS members who were in allied POW camps. The lesser plan was put into operation in April 1946 at Stalag 13. Kovner's story was repeated in 1998 by another Nakam leader Yulik Harmatz. There is no independent evidence for the meeting and some historians <b>doubt</b> <b>it.</b> Kovner's biographer Dina Porat wrote that Weizmann was not in Palestine on the date of the alleged meeting but allows that he might have met Weizmann in early 1946 instead.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I <b>doubt</b> <b>it.</b> One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

She was certainly a liberated woman who didn't take any guff off anyone." ...|$|E

500|$|Australian analyst Brian Cloughley {{said the}} attack would have severe consequences: [...] "This is quite {{outrageous}} and I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> signifies {{the end of}} the last lingering shreds of trust that the Pakistani army had for the U.S.". According to Coughley, the USAF had full knowledge of the locations of Pakistani border posts, and thus there was no excuse for this incident.|$|E

[...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American rock band No <b>Doubt.</b> <b>It</b> was released as the seventh and final single from their third studio album Tragic Kingdom (1995).

The single was issued on January 20, 1997 as a CD single. It was written by Gwen Stefani, Tom Dumont, and Tony Kanal, with its production handled by Matthew Wilder. Its lyrics allude to Stefani's relationship status with Kanal, who broke up their seven-year relationship when creating Tragic Kingdom.|$|E

60|$|For many a {{long and}} bitter day, Bertram had persuaded himself {{that she had not}} really loved him. He had <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> when she had first told him so calmly that it was {{necessary}} that their marriage should be postponed for years; he had <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> much when he found her, if not happy, at least contented under that postponement; doubt had become almost certainty when he learnt that she discussed his merits with such a one as Henry Harcourt; but on that day, at Richmond, when he discovered that the very secrets of his heart were made subject of confidential conversation with this man, he had <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> no longer. Then he had gone to her, and his reception proved to him that his doubts had been too well founded--his certainty only too sure. And so he had parted with her--as we all know.|$|R
