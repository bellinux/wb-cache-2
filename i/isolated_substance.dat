50|$|Isatin forms a {{blue dye}} (indophenin) {{if it is}} mixed with sulfuric acid and crude benzene. The {{formation}} of the indophenin was long {{believed to be a}} reaction with benzene. Victor Meyer was able to <b>isolate</b> the <b>substance</b> responsible for this reaction from crude benzene. This new heterocyclic compound was thiophene.|$|R
30|$|The main use of TG {{analysis}} includes {{measurement of}} a compost/vermicompost’s thermal stability and composition. We can evaluate {{the degree of}} maturation and stabilization of compost/vermicompost without extraction and fragmentation procedures to <b>isolate</b> humic-like <b>substances.</b> This technique is quite inexpensive, rapid, information rich, require little sample preparation and can give reproducible results.|$|R
