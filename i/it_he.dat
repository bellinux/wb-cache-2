5|$|Allenby's {{plan was}} to avoid {{fighting}} in or near Jerusalem but to cut all road access {{to the city and}} force the Ottoman Army to evacuate <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> ordered two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{elections}} to the First Duma (legislative assembly in the late Russian Empire), which were boycotted by the PPS, the National Democrats won 34 of the 55 seats allotted to Poland. Dmowski himself was elected a deputy to the Second and Third Dumas (beginning on 27 February 1907) and was president of the Polish caucus within <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> was seen as a conservative, and despite being a Polish caucus leader, he often had more influence on the Russian than the Polish deputies.|$|E
5|$|At the Kingsmoot, Yara {{makes her}} {{claim to the}} Salt Throne, with Theon Greyjoy {{supporting}} her claim. Their uncle Euron Greyjoy arrives to stake his own claim, and when Yara accuses him of killing their father, Euron freely admits to <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> promises to conquer Westeros by marrying Daenerys, and offering her the Iron Fleet. He is subsequently chosen as King. Theon and Yara flee with the best ships of the Iron Fleet; Euron orders the Ironborn to begin {{construction of a new}} fleet.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 12th century, {{the castle}} become closely {{associated}} with King John, who had been granted the town by Richard I in 1189. John seized the castle as well during his revolt in 1191, and although he was forced to return <b>it,</b> <b>he</b> reclaimed it when he became king himself in 1199. John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it.|$|E

5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for <b>it,</b> <b>he</b> is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell <b>it,</b> <b>he</b> gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In <b>it</b> <b>he</b> expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E

5|$|Despite Queen's Park {{entering}} the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers {{who won the}} game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during play, and the referee later {{said that they had}} scored once more but as the players did not attempt to claim <b>it,</b> <b>he</b> had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885.|$|E

5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. One observer was Hugh Dowding, initially {{as the director of}} research for the RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> addressed this through the creation of what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E
5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793. In <b>it</b> <b>he</b> declared the United States neutral {{in the conflict}} between Great Britain and France. He also threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance {{to any of the}} warring countries. Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, in his view, unnecessary harm.|$|E
