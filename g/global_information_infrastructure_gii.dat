40|$|Decentralized {{construction}} of the <b>Global</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> (<b>GII)</b> is substituting market-driven, `de facto' standards and voluntary agreements on standards for technical compatibility, {{in place of the}} engineering decisions once made by public (and quasi-public) telecommunications network operators. Due to strategic economic behaviours on the part of private businesses and national governments, the goal of a fully interoperable GII remains elusive. The Internet does not offer an entirely credible alternative model, as the standards that have facilitated its explosive growth also are contributing to serious congestion problems, and the solutions proposed point to the Internet's re-integration into the public switched telecommunications network. Technical standards will shape the GII's implications for international trade and competition, and thus raise important, but inadequately recognized issues for regulation, competition and trade policy...|$|E

OMODIS is a five year project funded by the Norwegian Research Council (NFR) {{in the context of}} the Distributed Systems (DITS) program.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current advantages {{and limitations of}} the developing <b>Global</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> (<b>GII)</b> for commerce {{from the point of}} view of today's players. It is based on the interim results of an Expert Survey being carried out as part of the ACTS project SEMPER (Secure Electronic Marketplace for Europe) 1. The findings can be broadly categorised as `network' and `non-network' influences on participation in electronic commerce, i. e. those directly related to the use of computer technology for connecting to and navigating in open networks and the non-technical influences on the willingness or ability to conduct business in this environment. The analysis is primarily based on use of the Internet because it is currently the most widely used precursor of the GII. 1.

40|$|Information overload, {{arising from}} {{different}} types of heterogeneous digital data readily accessible from millions of repositories, is a critical problem on the <b>Global</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> (<b>GII).</b> We present an information brokering approach, architecture and techniques that address issues related to information overload on the GII. The approach spans three levels: representation (structure/format/type) of digital data, information content captured in the data; and the vocabulary underlying the data. Metadata (data/information about data) is used to abstract from heterogeneous representational details and capture information content. Domain specific ontologies are used to represent and interoperate across different vocabularies used to characterize information content. The approach thus suggested induces a metadata-based architecture that enables information brokering at the different levels. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by using {{a wide variety of}} metadata to capture information content for textual, image and structured data. These metadata belong to a wide spectrum and may range from metadata independent of the data content to those capturing information content in a application and domain specifi...|$|E

Such guidelines – which governments would adopt, and businesses, individuals and law-enforcement officials would apply in safeguarding electronic transactions, communications, and data storage – {{are expected to be}} recommended by the OECD Council in spring 1997. Cryptography is the discipline that embodies the principles, means and methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its content, establish its authenticity, prevent its undetected modification or unauthorised use. Cryptography is therefore an essential component of tomorrow’s <b>Global</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> (<b>GII).</b> Cryptographic techniques enable users to protect the privacy of their data (financial or personal records, for example), whether the data are in storage or in transit. Cryptographic techniques also allow users to determine whether someone has altered data – whether, for example, a hacker who has broken into medical records has altered any element of them. They also enable users to determine with confidence the identity of a person or device at a distance, not least by establishing the authenticity of a given document. Cryptography uses a mathematical algorithm to scramble data. Historically, its first use was ‘encryption’, the transformation of data in orde...|$|E
