40|$|Several EU Directives and {{regional}} conventions {{are concerned with}} the protection and conservation of marine habitats of special importance; a necessary prerequisite to implement such legislation are marine <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> systems and information on the distribution of marine habitat types. There are several <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> schemes in use for the description, designation and monitoring of habitats. The ‘Interpretation Manual for Marine Habitats within the 25 NM Fisheries Management Zone around the Republic of Malta’ provides an updated description of marine habitats found around the Maltese Islands, as well as a cross-referencing scheme for the different <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> systems. Marine <b>habitats</b> are listed according to bathymetric zone, going from shallow to deep water. The bathymetric zones included in the interpretation manual are: (1) mediolittoral, (2) infralittoral, (3) circalittoral, and (4) bathyal. Habitats listed in the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) database were reviewed, habitats which are present in the Maltese Islands were identified, and ‘new’ habitat categories have been included in the manual where there was no equivalent <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat.</b> For each habitat category presented, cross- references to the system used in connection with the Protocol for Specially Protected Areas and Biodiversity in the Mediterranean (SPABM) of the Barcelona Convention, to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) classification system of predominant habitat types, {{as well as to the}} marine habitats listed in Annex I of the ‘Habitats Directive’, were established. In addition a scheme to enable the assessment of the conservation status of marine habitats as required under the ‘Habitats Directive’ was drawn up by considering the habitat range, the area occupied by a habitat, habitat structure and function, and the habitat’s future prospects. Suitable indicators to assess favourable conservation status are presented for (i) sandbanks, (ii) Posidonia beds, (iii) reefs and (iv) sea caves. In addition, indicators to assess the conservation status of maerl beds are presented due to the local significance and the sensitivity of this habitat. The manual thus intends to aid in the implementation of measures for the protection of marine habitats and hence, ultimately, to ensure effective and efficient management of the marine environment under the jurisdiction of Malta up to the 25 NM boundary, in line with the relevant legislation. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The European Nature Information System (EUNIS) {{has been}} {{implemented}} {{for the establishment}} of a marine European habitats inventory. Its hierarchical classification is defined and relies on environmental variables which primarily constrain biological communities (e. g. substrate types, sea energy level, depth and light penetration). The <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> scheme relies on thresholds (e. g. fraction of light and energy) which are based on expert judgment or on the empirical analysis of the above environmental data. The present paper proposes to establish and validate an appropriate threshold for energy classes (high, moderate and low) and for subtidal biological zonation (infralittoral and circalittoral) suitable for <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> of the Western Iberian coast. Kineticwave-induced energy and the fraction of photosynthetically available light exerted on the marine bottom were respectively assigned to the presence of kelp (Saccorhiza polyschides, Laminaria hyperborea and Laminaria ochroleuca) and seaweed species in general. Both data were statistically described, ordered fromthe largest to the smallest and percentile analyseswere independently performed. The threshold between infralittoral and circalittoral was based on the first quartile while the ‘moderate energy’ class was established between the 12. 5 and 87. 5 percentiles. To avoid data dependence on sampling locations and assess the confidence interval a bootstrap technique was applied. According to this analysis,more than 75 % of seaweeds are present at locations where more than 3. 65 % of the surface light reaches the sea bottom. The range of energy levels estimated using S. polyschides data, indicate that on the IberianWest coast the ‘moderate energy’ areas are between 0. 00303 and 0. 04385 N/m 2 of wave-induced energy. The lack of agreement between different studies in different regions of Europe suggests the need for more standardization in the future. However, the obtained thresholds in the present study will be very useful in the near future to implement and establish the Iberian EUNIS habitats inventory. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|The EUNIS-compliant {{information}} on Seabed Habitats {{that is currently}} available from the EMODNET portal covers {{only about half of}} the European Union (EU) waters in the Northeast Atlantic and adjacent Seas with EU outermost regions {{in other parts of the}} Atlantic or in the Indian Ocean still remaining out of the exercise. These gaps limit the geographical comprehensiveness of any studies on seabed-related Ecosystem Functions and Services. However, separate broad-scale seabed habitat mapping sources offer complementary seabed-related geospatial information that can be straightforwardly or, after some basic GIS processing, translated into EUNIS classes. This work focused on expeditiously obtaining a comprehensive coverage of permanently submerged seabed <b>habitats</b> (i. e., <b>EUNIS</b> classes A 3 to A 6) throughout most of the EU marine waters. This was achieved by bringing in, and harmonizing where need, complementary EUNIS-compliant broad-scale geospatial information from the UNEP’s Global Seafloor Geomorphic Features Map (GSGFM). The new geospatial dataset obtained, a polygon shapefile, extends for approximately 8. 7 million km 2 and more than doubles the coverage of <b>EUNIS</b> seabed <b>habitat</b> classes when compared to the datasets available from the EMODNET Seabed Habitats portal. The new information details more than 90 % of the EU waters down to EUNIS level 2 and 3, improving EMODNET datasets by populating the deep-sea and offshore areas with previously disregarded geomorphic-based <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> classes. Conversely, it is acknowledged that the GSGFM data could did not bring in any relevant information concerning <b>EUNIS</b> shelf <b>habitats.</b> The methodology and some area-based statistics on seabed habitat are presented, including overall and basin-specific mapped extents. It is noted that the mapping and quantification of several habitat extents are still geographically biased and underestimate the actual extent of the habitat.

These are firstly seabed type, topography and exposure, but in the more inshore areas also include water transparency, salinity, temperature etc. Some relations have been established in a top-down approach between adequate combinations of these variables and the higher levels of the Eunis (European Nature Information System) <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> which is currently being used to harmonise seabed habitat mapping throughout Europe. These levels have {{been referred to as}} "Marine landscapes", as they are aggregations of a number of lower <b>Eunis</b> <b>habitats</b> from levels 4 to 6. More elaborate variables that are thought to have a bearing on habitat types can be computed from the initial basic ones through comprehensive use of GIS functions. The depth provides slope and orientation. An aggregation of currents and wave action on the seabed provides exposure. Sediment grain size along with currents and slopes allow bedforms on sedimentary bottoms to be predicted. Adequate binning of these quantities and their cross-tabulation leads to a number of landscape types which usually pertain to level 3, but also 4 at times. That raises the question: to which extent could assimilating of biological samples (by way of, e. g., a point–to-polygon method) allow a holistic habitat map at a lower typology level to be produced? The notion of marine landscape can be further exploited to describe any particular habitat, provided that the distribution laws of this habitat with respect to the geophysical parameters are established on the basis of adequate field data sets.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of intensifying {{anthropogenic}} pressures on sandy shores, the mapping of benthic habitat appears as an essential first step and a fundamental baseline for marine spatial planning, ecosystem-based management and conservation efforts of soft-sediment intertidal areas. Mapping allows representing intertidal habitats that are basically characterised by abiotic (e. g sediments, exposure to waves…) and biotic factors such as macrobenthic communities. Macrobenthic communities are known to show zonation patterns across sandy beaches and many studies highlighted the existence of three biological zones. We tested this general model of a tripartite biological division of the shore at a geographical scale of policy, conservation and management decisions (i. e. Northern France coastline), using multivariate analyses combined with the Direct Field Observation (DFO) method. From the upper to the lower shores, {{the majority of the}} beaches exhibited three macrobenthic communities confirming the existence of the tripartite biological division of the shore. Nevertheless, in some cases, two or four zones were found: (1) two zones when the drying zone located on the upper shore was replaced by littoral rock or engineering constructions and (2) four zones on beaches and estuaries where a muddy-sand community occurred from the drift line to the mid shore. The correspondence between this zonation pattern of macrobenthic communities and the <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> was investigated and the results were mapped to provide a reference state of intertidal soft-sediment beaches and estuaries. Our results showed evidence of the applicability of this EUNIS typology for the beaches and estuaries at a regional scale (Northern France coastline) with a macroecological approach. In order to fulfil the requirements of the European Directives (WFD and MFSD), this mapping appears as a practical tool for any functional study on these coastal ecosystems, for the monitoring of anthropogenic activities and for the implementation of management plans concerning effective conservation strategies...|$|E

EU Member States are required to prepare and propose a national list of sites for evaluation under the scheme, but currently the occurrence of reefs in the United Kingdom's nearshore and offshore areas is not well documented. Here we report on our search for rocky reefs in the central English Channel, which unexpectedly revealed an extensive reef system covering an area of 1100 km 2. Prior to our work, it was generally perceived that the seabed in this area comprised mostly gravel, with a few isolated rock outcrops. Our approach to determining the location, extent and character of these reefs incorporated broad, medium and fine-scale analyses over a 3200 km 2 area of seabed, using single- and multi-beam acoustic data, ground-truthed by underwater video and stills imagery. A benthic terrain model was developed in ArcGIS to map topographic features at the broad and medium scales. Biotope assignments were made at the fine scale through detailed analysis of video footage obtained from 30 sampling stations. The study area has a complex geological history and lies at the centre of a major bedload-parting zone. Together, these strongly influence the seabed character and the distribution of biotopes. An integrated assessment of the physical and biological features was used to map the study area to level 4 of the <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> system. Similar physical conditions exist {{in other areas of the}} UK continental shelf, raising the prospect of predicting where other rocky reef systems might occur.

40|$|The EUNIS (European Union Nature Information System) habitat {{classification}} system aims {{to provide a}} common European reference set of habitat types within a hierarchical classification, and to cover all terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats of Europe. The classification facilitates reporting of habitat data in a comparable manner, for use in nature conservation (e. g. inventories, monitoring and assessments), habitat mapping and environmental management. For the marine environment {{the importance of a}} univocal habitat {{classification system}} is confirmed by the fact that many European initiatives, aimed at marine mapping, assessment and reporting, are increasingly using EUNIS habitat categories and respective codes. For this reason substantial efforts have been made to include information on marine benthic habitats from different regions, aiming to provide a comprehensive geographical coverage of European seas. However, there still remain many concerns on its applicability as {{only a small fraction of}} Europe's seas are fully mapped and increasing knowledge and application raise further issues to be resolved. This paper presents an overview of the main discussion and conclusions of a workshop, organised by the MeshAtlantic project, focusing upon the experience in using the EUNIS habitats classification across different countries and seas, together with case studies. The aims of the meeting were to: (i) bring together scientists with exper_ience_in the use of the EUNIS marine classification and representatives from the European Environment Agency (EEA); (ii) agree on enhancements to EUNIS that ensure an improved representation of the European marine habitats; and (iii) establish practices that make marine habitat maps produced by scientists more consistent with the needs of managers and decision-makers. During the workshop challenges for the future development of EUNIS were identified, which have been classified into five categories: (1) structure and hierarchy; (2) biology; (3) terminology; (4) mapping; and (5) future development. The workshop ended with a declaration from the attendees, with recommendations to the EEA and European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity, to take into account the outputs of the workshop, which identify weaknesses in the current classification and include proposals for its modification, and to devise a process to further develop the marine component of the <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|E
40|$|Spread {{of alien}} species (AS) {{is a serious}} threat to marine {{habitats}} and analysis of principal descriptors of their occurrence is pivotal to set reliable conservation strategies. In order to assess the susceptibility of marine habitats to biological invasions, a dataset was gathered of the occurrence of 3899 species from 29 phyla, taken from 93 marine sites located along the Italian coast in the period 2000 - 2012. In total, 61 AS belonging to 11 phyla have been recorded. Invertebrates were the most represented (63 %). Alien species were found in all the <b>habitats</b> examined (<b>EUNIS,</b> level 2), although they showed highest abundance in benthic habitats. Most of the AS were associated with a single <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat,</b> while some of them were present in more than one habitat. Trans-habitat occurrence suggests the potential invasiveness of AS. According to statistical analysis, AS recorded could have been more numerous, since some of the marine habitats seemed to be still unsaturated. The model that best describes the spread of AS takes account of both native species richness (Rn) and <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> type as explanatory variables. The number of observed AS was directly related to Rn and it was highest in rocky circalittoral and infralittoral habitats. The results of this macro-ecological study focus on the importance of performing large-scale studies, since adopting ecosystem approaches to marine invasion management seems especially fruitful. The results, moreover, highlight the importance of AS monitoring of different habitats, from those subjected to anthropogenic pressure, historically considered to be hubs of introduction of AS, to the most biologically rich and diverse marine habitats. Indeed, it is necessary to set monitoring strategies to detect the introduction, the distribution and persistence of AS over time.

New technologies for collecting biological and physical data coupled with advances in modelling techniques could help address these gaps and facilitate improved management outcomes. Here {{we examined the}} utility of environmental data, obtained using different methods, for developing models of both uni- and multivariate biodiversity metrics. We tested which biodiversity metrics could be predicted best and evaluated the performance of predictor variables generated from three types of habitat data: acoustic multibeam sonar imagery, predicted <b>habitat</b> <b>classification,</b> and direct observer <b>habitat</b> <b>classification.</b> We used boosted regression trees (BRT) to model metrics of fish species richness, abundance and biomass, and multivariate regression trees (MRT) to model biomass and abundance of fish functional groups. We compared model performance using different sets of predictors and estimated the relative influence of individual predictors. Models of total species richness and total abundance performed best; those developed for endemic species performed worst. Abundance models performed substantially better than corresponding biomass models. In general, BRT and MRTs developed using predicted <b>habitat</b> <b>classifications</b> performed less well than those using multibeam data. The most influential individual predictor was the abiotic categorical variable from direct observer <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> and models that incorporated predictors from direct observer <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> consistently outperformed those that did not.

40|$|International audienceBenthic {{studies in}} the English Channel (EC), a shallow megatidal and epicontinental sea, began in the 1960 s and 1970 s {{with the work of}} teams led by Norman Holme (UK) and Louis Cabioch (F). During this period, benthic {{sampling}} was mainly qualitative, i. e. using a device such as the 'Rallier du Baty' dredge {{in the case of the}} French team and a modified anchor dredge in the case of the British team. Studies were focused on acquiring knowledge of the main distributions of benthic communities and species. Surveys on the scale of the whole EC led to the recognition of general features and two main patterns were identified: 1) the role of hydrodynamics on the spatial distribution of sediment, benthic species and communities; 2) the presence of a west–east climatic gradient of faunal impoverishment. Benthic {{studies in the}} 1980 s– 1990 s were focused on the beginning of the implementation of long-term survey at a limited number of sites to identify seasonal and multi-annual changes. In the first decade of the 2000 s, the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to define the Ecological Quality Status of marine environments increased the need to acquire better information of the structure and functioning of benthic communities, since benthic species and habitats were recognised as good indicators of human pressure on marine ecosystems. Faced with the increase of human maritime activities, the appearance of invasive species and the need to preserve sensitive marine habitats, benthic studies have been focused on developing a 'toolkit' to help in the decision-making and planning for both sound governance and sustainable management of marine resources and human activities in the English Channel. Multidisciplinary approaches were used to differentiate habitats in a more precise detail. Both indirect (side-scan sonar, ROV) and direct (grab sampling with benthos identification and grain-size analyses) approaches were used and combined to allow the description of benthic habitats using numerous descriptors. These approaches were mainly applied on a local scale, leading to the identification of habitat mosaics mainly in coarse sands, gravels and pebbly areas which cover 80 % of the EC seabed. They also allowed the enrichment of the <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> for infralittoral and circalittoral zones taking into account the scale of observations of benthic habitats.

The report recommends thresholds and assessment categories that are fully compatible with developing IUCN proposals. As a basis for its recommendations, the report reviews the kinds of typology that are used for habitat description – classifications based on fine-scale species assemblages, mid-scale habitat/biotope classifications and broad-scale ecosystem typologies. It reviews how far each typology {{has been used for}} Red List assessment and discusses the various scales on which such evaluations have been made. Relationships between these typologies and classifications used in the Habitats Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive are discussed. The report then outlines the core criteria and the thresholds that have been used so far for Red List assessment: quantity (Area of Occupancy, Extent of Occurrence, dispersal/fragmentation, endemism and stand size), quality (speciesrichness, presence of rare, threatened or endemic species, structure, function & landscape context) and trends (in both quantity and quality, both back in time and forwards). It also considers various supplementary criteria that have been used for some Red List assessments: scales of naturalness/hemeroby, drivers and threats, degrees of resilience and restoration capacity. Actual Red List evaluation processes are then described, in the developing IUCN programme for ecosystems and among other approaches, and the role of expert judgment and peer review in assessment is discussed. There is then a critical review of the assessment categories employed for Red Listing: extinct (completely destroyed, extirpated), critically endangered (immediately threatened, severely declined), endangered (threatened, significantly declined), vulnerable (potentially endangered), least concern (secure, not endangered), increasing and data-deficient.

European Directives, such as the MSFD, but also the Horizon 2020 roadmap explicitly called for a multi-resolution full coverage of all European seas including bathymetry, geology and habitats. The present work, following on a suite of past initiatives, has made a big step forward in this direction. It has first boosted the collation of existing maps from surveys by setting up a framework and a procedure to encourage people to submit their maps and data. This resulted in a more attractive EMODnet seabed habitat portal and a snowball effect with more and more people willing to join. However, collation will eventually come to an end and as new creations of seabed habitat maps are so complex and time-consuming, a cost-efficient way to meet the need for a full-coverage habitat map was found to be low-resolution maps and models to predict seafloor habitat types. The broad-scale map referred to as EUSeaMap has been created by this project and after the first two phases it now covers all European basins from the Barents Sea to Macaronesia and to the Black Sea. By harmonising mapping procedures - based on the EUNIS classification - and fostering a common understanding among seabed mappers in Europe, EUSeaMap provides today the community with a comprehensive, free and ready-to-use map that can find applications at regional scale for management and conservation issues. Tables and maps for all basins can be found in section 3 “Results and disciussions”. The project has played a key role in giving feedback to other EMODnet communities dealing with bathymetry, geology and biology, all essential data sources for the broad-scale map. It has also improved the understanding of the <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> - with a focus on the Adriatic and the Black Sea - by better specifying transitions between classes based on benthic ground-truth data. It has fostered the development of oceanographic variables such as light, waves and currents that have a strong bearing on habitats. Finally it has also been instrumental in developing map confidence assessment methods that account for the broad spatial variation in data sources quality and for uncertain boundaries between habitat classes. The EUSeaMap methods are repeatable and ensure that the predictive maps can continue to be improved in the future, as a result either of EUNIS enhancements or increase in resolution. From today’s 250 m resolution it is likely that new deliveries of enhanced source layers due to steady progress in oceanography and geophysics will enable constant refinement of the maps over time...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{pressures}} on global biodiversity {{and lack of}} data on the number and abundance of species have motivated conservation planners and researchers to use more readily available information as proxies or surrogates for biodiversity. “Habitat” {{is one of the}} most frequently used surrogates but its assumed value in marine conservation planning is not often tested. The present study developed and tested three alternative <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> schemes of increasing complexity for a large estuary in southeast Australia and tested their effectiveness in predicting spatial variation in macroinvertebrate biodiversity and selecting estuarine protected areas to represent species. The three <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> schemes were: (1) broad-scale habitats (e. g., mangroves and seagrass), (2) subdivision of each broad-scale habitat by a suite of environmental variables that varied significantly throughout the estuary, and (3) subdivision of each broad-scale habitat by the subset of environmental variables that best explained spatial variation in macroinvertebrate biodiversity. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed significantly among the <b>habitats</b> in each <b>classification</b> scheme. For each <b>classification</b> scheme, <b>habitat</b> richness was significantly correlated with species richness, total density of macroinvertebrates, assemblage dissimilarity, and summed irreplaceability. However, in a reserve selection process designed to represent examples of each <b>habitat,</b> no <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> scheme represented species significantly better than a random selection of sites. <b>Habitat</b> <b>classification</b> schemes may represent variation in estuarine biodiversity; however, the results of this study suggest they are inefficient in designing representative networks of estuarine protected areas...|$|R

40|$|The Humber Regional Environmental Characterisation (REC) is a {{multidisciplinary}} marine {{study of the}} geology, biology and archaeology of an area of 11 000 km 2 off {{the east coast of}} England. It was funded by the Marine Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). 2. Within the REC area, there are 12 active aggregate licences with applications submitted for 10 more. Within the region there is also gas production, wind energy development, and intensive shellfish harvesting. Without proper management of the sea bed areas there could be conflict over development of resources in the area. 3. The overall objective of the REC project was to provide integrated broadscale seabed maps in order to support the sustainable management of offshore resources now and into the future. The basis of the maps is a regional assessment of the physical, biological and archaeological environment. Here for the Humber REC area we present the results of each individual project element together with their integration into a holistic overview of the marine environment. 4. In addition to SeaZone single beam bathymetry, data from three geophysical and one sampling survey provided the basis for the interpretation. BGS legacy data supplemented the new data set. In total these data provided a sound basis for reporting on the regional character of the geology, biology and archaeology of the area. 5. The geology of the Humber REC area is characterised by a western gravelly region, a sandy eastern one and a transitional area in between. Outside of large sand banks and areas of sand waves the mobile sediment cover is thin. The terminations of the outer Norfolk Banks are located in the southeast of the area, and a series of low amplitude sinuous and linear banks are found in the southwest and centre. A number of arcuate and linear deeps, with a radial pattern incise the seabed. 6. The morphology and sediment distribution are attributed to a number of episodes; initially the region was glaciated and the Bolders Bank till Formation was laid down. After deglaciation the till was eroded to leave a thin coarse-grained relict deposit. As sea level rose the area was transgressed, the relict deposit winnowed and fine grained sediment was transported into the area from the south. This sediment was reworked into the sand banks and sand waves present today over much of the sea bed. The dominance of gravelly sediment in the nearshore areas is the result of strong currents. 7. The Humber REC area is a region which is rich in archaeology, with finds ranging from the Palaeolithic to World War II. The archaeological material in the Humber REC region can be found both on and beneath the seabed. This archaeological material can be grouped into three main categories, prehistoric, maritime and aviation, all of which are present within the study area. 8. Several locations of archaeo-environmental potential were discovered during the Humber REC which directly relate to the regions prehistoric archaeological potential. Most of this potential is present in major channel systems within the south and east of the study area and dates to the Mesolithic period. 9. The submerged prehistoric resource has been characterised. This has been derived from the spatial mapping for the Mesolithic period. Evidence for earlier periods of prehistory is limited within the study area. The characterisation of the Mesolithic landscape indicates that where suitable preservation conditions exist there may be a large resource of material present. 10. The maritime archaeological resource from the late 19 th century onwards can be located across the study area and has also been spatially mapped and characterised. No evidence was found for pre 19 th century wrecks, despite documentary evidence indicating their presence. 11. The Humber REC area has also been a focus for aviation activity, particularly during World War II, and correspondingly, wrecked aircraft are likely. As most aircraft break up on impact, the wreckage is not commonly intact and can be hard to locate. As such, the number of aircraft wreck sites known to be present within the study area is assumed to represent only a small proportion of incidents, but are possibly more likely in areas on routes to and from World War II targets such as nearby airbases and Kingston upon Hull. 12. Analysis of the biological data collected across the Humber REC study area revealed four functional biological communities. 13. The most common community ‘infaunal polychaetes with burrowing bivalves and amphipods’ was recorded across much of the mid and eastern sections of the study area in sandy deposits. The second most abundant community was characterised by ‘barnacles, ascidians and tubiculous polychaetes’ and was associated with coarser, mixed sediments with suitable areas for attachment. In some areas where the REC study area was influenced by higher levels of sand this community was replaced by a ‘Sabellaria spinulosa reef’ community. A small number of locations, in both mixed and sandy sediments, were found to support a very sparse biological community. 14. The biological communities were found to correlate strongly with the composition of sediment deposits, but were also influenced by shear bed stress and stratification of the water column. Predicted biotope distributions maps were created for the Humber REC study area utilising the <b>EUNIS</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> scheme and habitat suitability modelling. Both methods yielded maps which are suitable for marine management purposes. However, since the EUNIS scheme forces a split on a limited set of environmental variables, which did not correlate strongly with the biological communities, it was felt that this method led to an overly complicated map with many communities occurring in multiple habitats. The EUNIS habitat model and RECHUM functional community model were combined to create a full coverage biotope model equivalent to EUNIS Level 5. 15. A number of rare and alien species were identified across the Humber REC study area including the tiny bivalve Coracuta obliquata This is only the second record of this species from British waters in the last 100 years. The invasive American Slipper limpet was also observed and it is thought that these records may indicate a northwards shift in the range of this species, possibly associated with a warming climate. 16. Potentially important Annex I reef habitats were found in association with the Silver Pit. The reefs were predominantly created by the Ross worm Sabellaria spinulosa although high densities of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were also identified. It seems likely that there is a cyclical succession occurring between these two reef building species driven by minor changes in environmental conditions and recruitment success...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Habitats {{are defined}} as {{spatially}} recognizable areas where the physical, chemical, and biological environment is distinctly different from surrounding environments. A habitat can be delimited as narrowly or as broadly as the data and purpose permit, and this flexibility of scale influences the development of <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> schemes. Recent <b>habitat</b> <b>classifications</b> focus {{on a wide range}} of habitats that occur in European, American, and worldwide seafloor environments. The proposed classification of marine sublittoral habitats is based on recent studies in the American and Canadian parts of northeastern North America using multibeam and side-scan sonar surveys, video and photographic transects, and sediment and biological sampling. A guiding principle in this approach to <b>habitat</b> <b>classification</b> is that it will be useful to scientists and managers of fisheries and the environment. The goal is to develop a practical method to characterize the marine sublittoral (chiefly the subtidal continental shelf and shelf basin) habitats in terms of (1) their topographical, geological, biological, and oceanographical attributes and (2) the natural and anthropogenic processes that affect the <b>habitats.</b> The <b>classification</b> recognizes eight seabed themes (informal units) as the major subject elements of the classification. They are seabed topography, dynamics, texture, grain size, roughness, fauna and flora, habitat association and usage, and habitat recovery from disturbance...|$|R
