500|$|Chambers also competed over 200m and a {{personal}} best run of 20.31s earned him selection in both sprints for the World Championships. In an interview with Tom Fordyce, Chambers stated that Maurice Greene's strong presence and mind games undermined the competition both physically and mentally. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{in front of him}} and hold on for dear life" [...] he said of the world record holder.|$|E
500|$|Although firmly {{established}} as the Astros' first baseman from Opening Day in 1991, Bagwell remarked {{years later that}} transitioning from third base was not automatic. [...] First basemen approach fielding plays from their right side, which is opposite to playing third base. [...] He recounted one conversation that occurred during an Astros pitching change {{in a game against}} St. Louis. [...] Shortstop Ozzie Smith was on first and asked Bagwell, [...] "How's it going?" [...] Bagwell responded, [...] "I'm really struggling with my backhand." [...] Smith replied, [...] "Well, here's what you do. [...] You can't field the ball deep. [...] You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> in front of it." [...] Remarked Bagwell, [...] "I was basically being given a lesson from Ozzie Smith at first base during a pitching change. It's pretty cool." ...|$|E

500|$|Zelda {{never became}} {{particularly}} domestic, nor showed {{any interest in}} housekeeping. By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote, [...] "See {{if there is any}} bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the house for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1998 {{article in}} the Auburn Plainsman, the most likely origin of the [...] "War Eagle" [...] cry grew from a 1913 pep rally at Langdon Hall, where {{students}} had gathered {{the day before the}} annual football game against the University of Georgia. [...] Cheerleader Gus Graydon told the crowd, [...] "If we are going to win this game, we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> there and fight, because this means war." [...] During the frenzy, another student, E. T. Enslen, dressed in his military uniform, noticed something had dropped from his hat. [...] Bending down, he saw it was the metal emblem of an eagle that had come loose during his wild cheering. [...] Someone asked him what he had found, and Enslen loudly replied, [...] "It's a War Eagle!" [...] The new cry was used by students at the game the following day.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman's {{earliest}} work, titled Operation Greenrun II {{and developed}} as his master's thesis at the University of Colorado, used billboards {{to draw attention}} to a contaminated nuclear production facility at Rocky Flats, Colorado. [...] In this work, eleven billboard faces were created with a message protesting the Rocky Flats site. [...] The ensuing controversy resulted in the decision to shut down Rocky Flats for good. [...] Writing of this project in her book titled Digital Currents: Art in the Electronic Age, Margot Lovejoy says of Freeman that he [...] "believes that a public art can circumvent problems of the gallery system such as the commodification of culture and the perpetuation of an exclusive, elite system for art. [...] He believes in bringing art to the public." [...] She goes on to quote Freeman, who said that [...] "If people are too busy to go to the gallery or museum, it makes sense to bring art to them. They don't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of their cars." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1822, a [...] "colonization road" [...] (a north-south road to {{facilitate}} settlement) known as Simcoe Street was constructed. It {{more or less}} followed the path of an old native trail known as the Nonquon Road, and ran from the harbour {{to the area of}} Lake Scugog. This intersected the [...] "Kingston Road" [...] at what would become Oshawa's [...] "Four Corners." [...] In 1836, Edward Skae relocated his general store approximately 800 m east to the southeast corner of this intersection; as his store became a popular meeting place (probably because it also served as the Post Office), the corner and the growing settlement that surrounded it, were known as Skae's Corners. In 1842, Skae, the postmaster, applied for official post office status, but was informed the community needed a better name. Moody Farewell was requested to ask his native acquaintances what they called the area; their reply was [...] "Oshawa," [...] which translates to [...] "where we must leave our canoes". Thus, the name of Oshawa, one of the primary [...] "motor cities" [...] of Canada, has the meaning [...] "where we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and walk". The name [...] "Oshawa" [...] was adopted and the post office named accordingly. In 1849, the requirements for incorporation were eased, and Oshawa was incorporated as a village in 1850.|$|E

25|$|The Kayak Experience: After {{the second}} visitor {{death in the}} park's history in 1982 {{occurred}} at this ride, it was closed permanently.
