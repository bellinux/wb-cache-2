[...] The {{domain name system}} acts like a large {{telephone}} directory and in that it's the master database, which associates a domain name such as www.wikipedia.org with the appropriate <b>IP</b> <b>number.</b> Consider the <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> something similar to a phone number: When someone calls www.wikipedia.org, the ISP looks at the DNS server, and asks [...] "how do I contact www.wikipedia.org?" [...] The DNS server responds, for example, [...] "it can be found at: 216.198.221.66.". As the Internet understands it, this can be considered the phone number for the server, which houses the website. When the domain name is registered/purchased on a particular registrar's [...] "name server", the DNS settings are kept on their server, {{and in most cases}} point the domain to the Name Server of your hosting provider. This Name Server is where the <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> (currently associated with your domain name) resides.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effect of mechanical closure of dead space after mastectomy in prevention of seroma formation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} but least-studied aspects of Internet policy is the emergence of a trading market for previously allocated Internet number blocks. Without unique Internet protocol numbers for the networks and devices attached, the Internet simply doesn’t work. The original Internet Protocol standard, known as IPv 4, specified a 32 -bit numbering space, which provided slightly less than 4 billion unique numbers that could be used as addresses (Postel, 1981). A large part of that number space has already been handed out to organizations. The available supply is dwindling, and the Asia-Pacific region is already reduced to rationing its last / 8 in tiny, 1024 -address chunks, one to an organization, while the European region is only a few months from that status. Recent market developments and policy changes by Internet number registries now allow organizations with more numbers than they want to sell them to another organization. In other words, a market for IPv 4 numbers is now possible. This is a major change in the political economy of Internet governance. It is likely that the commercial forces unleashed will have far-reaching consequences for Internet businesses, users and governance institutions. In a related area, domain name registration, the emergence of a commercial market led to the growth of a domain name industry and major changes in policies and institutions, such as the formation of ICANN, the separation of registries and registrars and the new gTLD program. After a highly publicized deal in which Microsoft bought Nortel’s number assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, the reality of an <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> market can no longer be denied. But many in the Internet technical community still feel uncomfortable about it. One reporter with attitudes typical of the technical community, has predicted that “a functioning market won't form at all, or will break down very quickly after it forms" (van Beijnum, 2011). This is partly due to an ideological resistance to the commodification of a critical Internet resource, and partly due to their fears that an IPv 4 market might delay or even prevent a migration to a new Internet protocol (IPv 6). Either way, few wish to openly acknowledge the market’s existence. Thus the topic of number markets brings to mind the phrase “the elephant in the room. ” Moreover, the information we have about this elephant is fragmented and unsystematic. <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> allocation is controlled on a contractual basis by five separate regional Internet registries (RIRs). Each has different policies toward transfers, different registry databases, and different disclosure practices. It is difficult, therefore, to obtain a comprehensive picture of the emerging market for IPv 4 number blocks. This recalls the old fable about the five blind men and the elephant, with each one having access to {{a small part of the}} body and none of them quite grasping the nature of the beast as a whole. Based on this double-elephant metaphor, this paper tries to make a less than elephantine but much-needed empirical contribution to the literature on the economics and institutions of IP addressing. While several papers already discuss <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> markets in theoretical or policy terms, no one has actually compiled and analyzed the transactions themselves. This paper draws on the records of the RIRs to compile as much information about traded <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> blocks as possible, and then conducts some very basic analysis of stocks, flows and proportions to assess the nature of this emerging market and explore some of its implications for Internet governance. Although it is early days for <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> markets, the data we have gathered already seem to have interesting implications for certain policy issues currently being debated.

When this system is handled with a standard IBE, the user must manage all the private keys that are associated with all the public keys (identities). However, keeping these private keys is inconvenient to the user. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a novel identity-based encryption where we set a private key that maps multiple public keys (identities); namely, we can use a private key to decrypt multiple ciphertexts; each was encrypted with a different public key (identity) ...|$|E

This {{is still in its}} early stages with DVB [1] currently at trial phase in Oxford with mobile operator O 2 and is based on the new DVB-H (digital video broadcasting- handheld) transmission technology. It works by beaming a signal to a digital TV receiver mounted in effect on a handheld device. This is, in the main, a common download facility with no ability for transmission to be directed to users on an individual basis. This paper addresses the difficult task of transmitting IP based video services from one mobile device to another when using standard mobile services in the UK. The issues surround the type of IP address provided to a device from the mobile provider on connection. The <b>IP</b> <b>number</b> is both DHCP served and not publicly routable.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the international collaborative project aiming to sequence the whole Bacillus subtilis chromosome, we have created a relational database for managing and analysing information associated with the molecular genetics of this bacterium: Subtiyist. It allows recovery of non-redundant DNA sequences of the B. subtilis genome, as well as related information, i. e. genes, proteins, etc. A logical structure has been designed with appropriate links between the different objects, and a set of procedures has been implemented for data updating and management. The database is organized around a core constituted by all known contigs of B. subtilis, i. e. sets of nonredundant sequences created from original entries in the EMBL data library. A user-friendly interface has been developed to make the database easy to consult. Sequence analysis tools have been integrated into the database, such as a program for rapid similarity searching of protein data banks, and a powerful DNA pattern searching program. Thanks to the consistency of Subtiyist, we have performed a codon usage analysis by Factorial Correspondence Analysis, and a study of the distribution of the isoelectric points of known proteins of B. subtilis.

Participants include 100 public officials positioned in various ministries. Quantitative research method was used in order to obtain information from participants. A questionnaire was submitted to the participants with meetings in person or via the Internet and data were collected. In order to ensure reliability and validity issues, expert opinion was sought as a means to measure validity and reliability. Necessary corrections were made based on the feedback provided. Outputs from the questionnaire were analyzed using the SPSS and the findings were evaluated. The results showed that participants who are rather young with high education levels, well-versed in national regulations, they have the knowledge about digital citizenship; however, it was found that they were not informed about technical issues such as international activities related to child pornography (CP), online child pornography, Darknet, p 2 p networks and hash databases. The findings showed that the reason behind the lack of awareness on some of these phenomena was the inherent problems in the education system and the insufficiency of the curriculum.

This study is carried out to study the clinical course of pulmonary infections in diabetics and comparing the clinical profile with the non-diabetics with pulmonary infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study {{was carried out in}} SSIMS & RC, Davangere over a period of 2 years from October 2012 to October 2014. 120 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus meeting the inclusion criteria were included and were compared with 80 age and sex matched healthy controls, fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A detailed proforma was filled up for each patient, which included age, sex, <b>IP</b> <b>number,</b> detailed history, past and personal history. A detailed clinical examination was done. Laboratory parameters including fasting and postprandial blood glucose, HbA 1 C, renal function tests, ECG and routine urine examination were done. Patient is investigated for chest x-ray, sputum for gram stain, culture and sensitivity pattern, AFB, fungal culture methods, BAL along with routine haematology and basic chemistry tests. Diagnosis of diabetes is done based on FBS/PPBS, oral glucose tolerance and HbA 1 c criteria i. e. FBS> 126 mg/dl, OGT> 200 mg/dl. When needed tests like 24 hour urine protein excretion, ECG, ophthalmoscopy, echocardiography The proposed study is conducted over a sample size of 150 - 200 cases fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS Diabetics with pulmonary infections were found to have a more severe form of clinical illness compared to non-diabetics. Extensive involvement of lung parenchyma was noted in diabetics. Diabetics were associated with more complications. Outcome of the illness was worse in the form of increased mortality in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. CONCLUSION There appear to be certain types of pulmonary infections that may be more common in diabetics than in non-diabetics. Diabetic patients also appear to be at an increased risk of complications of pneumonia, such as bacteraemia, or recurrent or chronic bacterial pneumonia, and have an increase in mortality that {{may be related to the}} coexistent medical disease. The predisposition may be based on conditions that interfere with normal clearance mechanisms or disturbance of pulmonary immune cell function. The predisposition is further to be complicated by coexisting medical conditions including malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, vascular insufficiency, and chronic renal disease...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present {{a process of}} {{creation}} of an online shop. The requests of a known customer were to create an online shop (for household appliances) that would enable an administration of the database of articles, review and acceptance of orders as well as review and ordering of articles. That was upgraded with a possibility of monitoring the number of visits, an individual visitor (through <b>IP</b> <b>number)</b> and article. That {{could be used as}} basis {{for the creation of a}} system which would by virtue of the numbers of visits reduce the article's price. The creation of the online shop was performed using processes of the development of information system with RUP methodologies. At the capturing of the requests we arrived to the following requests: the lease of an internet space where the internet site would host and offer possibilities of creating email addresses with its domain, the creation of an online shop, from the choice of the programming language to the database, and the creation of the manual for use. Cost-effectiveness, quick responsiveness of the help desk and quick responsiveness of the server were the reasons for which we decided to host the online shop on the server which is physically located in the United States of America (Arizona). The only weakness of such hosting is that the expenses of a lease of the server cannot simply be shown as the expenses of the undertaking. The creation of the internet site was performed in four phases: collection and analysis of the requests, creation of a database, creation of a code and testing of the online shop. Collection and analysis were done in cooperation with the management of the shop and with the system administrator. The online shop should enable the ordering of articles, informing of the person placing the order of the order, monitoring the number of visits, visitors and a certain article as well as processing all the data by the employee. Creation of a database took a lot of time. On account of a request for a possible future extension of a database we have organized articles by inheritance. Every group of articles has its specific features as well as the features that are common to all the articles (e. g. IDarticle, title, colour, warranty, price…). We have normalized all data structures up to the third normal form. In doing that we avoided the up-to-date anomalies. ...|$|E
