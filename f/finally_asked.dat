5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.|$|E
25|$|In October, Loos and {{her brother}} Clifford checked Emerson into a very {{expensive}} sanatorium, where {{he was diagnosed with}} schizophrenia. Loos, who had always left the finances to Emerson, soon discovered that most of her money was no longer in joint accounts but in his own private accounts. Overworked at the studio and under stress from Emerson, she became more and more depressed. After 17 years of his nonsense, she <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> Emerson for a divorce, and he agreed. Loos promptly bought herself out of her United Artists contract and re-signed with MGM, and bought a beach-front house in Santa Monica. Emerson would continue to find ways to stave off any talk of divorce plans, making finalization impossible. When Emerson was deemed well enough to leave the sanatorium, she paid for a nurse to care for him in an apartment of his own.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January Ilir Meta, {{chairman}} of LSI was shown {{putting pressure on}} one of the government ministers and finalizing a number of economic deals informally. Meta forced the Minister to cancel a deal between a contractor and the Ministry and to make a new deal with new terms with another individual connected with Meta's economic interests. Furthermore, he forced the Minister to hire two individuals into mid-level government jobs and <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> for another favor in a deal involving a hydro-electrical power plant. Meta mentioned that the profit for the Minister of the Economy would be around 700,000 euros in one of the deals and 7% {{of the value of the}} investment in the other – his personal profit was not mentioned. The American FBI examined Dritan Prifti's laptop and found that he was the person who took the bribes.|$|E

They play darts at the bar and later go to the football field to play football. While they are talking, Damon <b>finally</b> <b>asks</b> Stefan what does he want. Stefan starts talking about Katherine and tells him that what they felt about her was not real since she compelled them to think so. Damon doesn't {{want to talk about it}} and walks away. Stefan <b>finally</b> <b>asks</b> why he wants Katherine's crystal and Damon reveals his secret; he wants to bring Katherine back.|$|R

25|$|It {{took more}} than a year for the city to work out its TIF proposal. On December 16, 2003, the mayor's office <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> the city council to {{establish}} a nonprofit entity authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds and borrow $1 billion. Under the plan, $460 million of the bond issue would go toward building the convention headquarters hotel. (The city said Tishman Urban Development Corp., not JBG Cos., would construct the hotel.) The remaining bond issue would refinance the convention center's existing debt to take advantage of much lower interest rates. The bundled debt issue, the mayor's office said, made the bond issue more attractive to investors because it was backed by revenues from two entities rather than one. To further ensure that the bonds were accepted by Wall Street, the city agreed to guarantee a portion of bonds' interest with general sales tax revenue in case the hotel TIF did not cover the interest.|$|E
500|$|Along with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Monte Neuble, Perry {{wrote the}} song {{entitled}} [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] for her third studio album, Teenage Dream. A total of 17 music engineers {{contributed to the}} track's composition. Critics suggest the song is about her former relationship with Gym Class Heroes' lead vocalist Travie McCoy. When <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> about his opinion on the track, McCoy admitted to hearing about [...] "Circle the Drain", but has never actually listened to the song. Nonetheless, he commented: [...] "I heard she put out a song that's about me, or about some old habits or whatever. [...] I {{look at it like}} this: I'm just stoked that she finally has a song with some substance on her record. Good job." ...|$|E
500|$|In one {{particular}} scene, Ramachandran {{objected to the}} dialogue where he had to swear {{in the name of}} Allah, as he was then associated with the rationalist Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. He suggested that the dialogue be changed to swearing in the name of his mother, but was <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> by the director to use the original dialogue. When only a song and a fight sequence were left to be finished, Ramachandran could not appear for the shoot, since he had another film to shoot for. As Sundaram was unwilling to wait for Ramachandran's return, those portions were eventually shot with Karadimuthu, who acted as a body double for Ramachandran. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was processed at the Film Centre, Bombay (now Mumbai). The final length of the film was [...]|$|E

500|$|After dismissing a {{few more}} {{questions}} as [...] "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he [...] "needed a lawyer". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb [...] "leaping from topic to topic", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; {{he spoke in a}} casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said [...] "I don't remember." [...] Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, [...] "I don't remember. Somewhere." [...] When the doctor <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.|$|E
500|$|Groening {{had gained}} {{employment}} at the Los Angeles Reader, a newly formed alternative newspaper, delivering papers, typesetting, editing and answering phones. He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually {{gave him a}} spot in the paper. Life in Hell made its official debut as a comic strip in the Reader on April 25, 1980. Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, [...] "Sound Mix," [...] in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his [...] "various enthusiasms, obsessions, pet peeves and problems" [...] instead. In an effort to add more music to the column, he [...] "just made stuff up," [...] concocting and reviewing fictional bands and nonexistent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> to give up the [...] "music" [...] column. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Voyage Homes sound designer. He {{described}} it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to Star Trek had been established—the Bird-of-Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.—Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived near biologist Roger Payne, who had recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at {{the climax of the}} film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after more than a dozen attempts, the sound designer <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like. Mangini recorded Nimoy's guttural [...] "wub-wub-wub" [...] response, distorted it with [...] "just the tiniest bit of dressing", and used it as the final sound.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Sharon {{begins a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick's other brother, Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), and becomes pregnant with his child. However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if {{he really wanted to}} be with her or if it was just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{he never}} cared about titles, his son Pippin (Fr.: Pepin) did, and <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> the Pope [...] "who should be King, he {{who has the}} title, or he who has the power?" [...] The Pope, highly {{dependent}} on Frankish armies for his independence from Lombard and Byzantine power (the Byzantine Emperor still considered himself {{to be the only}} legitimate [...] "Roman Emperor", and thus, ruler of all of the provinces of the ancient empire, whether recognised or not), declared for [...] "he who had the power".|$|E

Upon his retirement in 1755, Heinrich Adolf von Kurssel became proprietor of Infantry Regiment Nr. 37. On 10 August 1756, Moulin died after a long illness in Stendal.

2500|$|The {{company had}} been {{considering}} the option of building tramways since 1793, and <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> Newbold to investigate the possible lines for railways which would serve the canal at Ashby Wolds in June 1798. They then asked Benjamin Outram to advise, and he reported in September. He suggested running the lines to Willesley Basin rather than Ashby Wolds, as this route would cost over £8,000 less. The lines as built ran from the basin through Ashby to a junction at Old Parks, where one branch ran through Lount to Cloud Hill, replacing the proposed canal and its diversion through Coleorton. The other branch led from Old Parks to Ticknall, with branches to the quarries between Calke Abbey and Staunton Harold. The total length of the lines was around [...]|$|E
2500|$|Cranton is {{interviewed by}} Wimsey and his brother-in-law, Detective Inspector Charles Parker. Much becomes clear when Cranton {{confirms}} that [...] "Cobbleigh" [...] was actually Deacon, the thieving butler. In 1918 he murdered a warder and escaped from prison. A body, apparently his, was later found, {{but in fact}} Deacon had murdered a soldier (Cobbleigh) and swapped identities with him. He married bigamously in France and waited several years to return for the emeralds, which he had hidden before his arrest. Since he risked hanging if caught, he <b>finally</b> <b>asked</b> Cranton to help, sending him the cipher as {{a clue to the}} hiding place as a token of good faith. Cranton could not solve it but knew it related to the bells, so he came to Fenchurch as [...] "Driver" [...] on New Year's Day (when Wimsey encountered him). He went to the bell-chamber on the night of 4 January, but found Deacon's dead, bound body in the chamber and fled, dropping the cipher.|$|E
