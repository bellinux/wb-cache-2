40|$|In {{this thesis}} a Finite Element Modelling (FEM) {{approach}} is proposed for modelling the visco-plastic creep effects that a PTFE-faced thrust bearing would undergo during normal operating conditions. A thermal elastic hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) model is developed, which uses the Reynolds equations for a fluid film, coupled with Hertzian contact {{theory and the}} energy equation to predict the pressure and film thickness on the PTFE face {{as well as the}} temperature and thickness of the fluid. These variables are then used with a Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> to predict the secondary creep effects on the PTFE surface. This change in PTFE thickness due to visco-plastic effects are taken into account within the film thickness equations and the effects over a bearing’s operational life span studied. The Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> is obtained from experimental creep results conducted on filled PTFE samples at the University of Leeds. This experimental method allowed for the displacement of the samples to be recorded over a 7 day test period at a representative range of pressure and temperature conditions and a Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> to be obtained from the results. The Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> was then included within the simulations to allow for the visco-plastic creep effects to be studied. Results obtained showed that whilst the secondary creep had a small effect on the pressure profile of the pad, the peak pressure was significantly affected during the duration of the pads operational life. It was concluded that this was due to the pad deformation changing, meaning a smaller peak pressure was observed, but the tilt angle did not change greatly, meaning the profile did not change. The pad and film thickness also changed as time passed, with the pad getting thinner in areas of high pressure and temperature, due to the secondary creep effects. It was also observed that the peak temperature of the pad also decreased as time passed, due to the film thickness increase in areas of high temperature. ...|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{society is}} {{considered}} a security seeking one. Forensic DNA is often presented {{as a tool to}} increase security. However, insecurities also follow in its wake. This thesis discusses such insecurities from a sociological perspective. In Norway, this thesis is the first work in this field, the first social science-based empirical research on the use of forensic DNA evidence and DNA databases. Hence this thesis may contribute to the conception of such uses, both within public debate and the expanding research field on the matter. Data gathered through qualitative methods are used to answer the research questions raised in the thesis. Qualitative interviews with stakeholders on DNA-matters such as lawyers, police, and expert witnesses are the main source of data. Additionally, official political documents in relation to the expansion of the Norwegian forensic DNA database are analyzed. This thesis consists of an introduction and four articles, all discussing insecurities in relation to the use of forensic DNA. The order in which the articles are presented may be seen as following forensic DNA chronologically into and within the criminal justice process. In the first article, the roles and impacts of numbers and statistics in crime policy decision making processes are discussed, using video surveillance and DNA databasing as examples. For both initiatives, persuasive but faulty statistics which demonstrated impressive effects {{played an important role in}} the early stages of the decision making processes. The aim of this article is to contribute to the research on political decision making processes, with its focus on the impact of numbers and statistics at different stages of the processes. In the second article DNA has reached the courtroom. By using the metaphor of a criminal case as a jigsaw puzzle this article analyses defense lawyers perceptions of securities and insecurities in relation to the use of DNA evidence in court. For many of the involved agents, DNA evidence seems to be black boxed. The black-boxing of influential technologies may contribute to insecurity. DNA is still in the courtroom in the third article which analyses a special situation in a Norwegian context, namely the use of second opinion on DNA evidence. It is argued that the use of second opinion may open, or reopen, the black boxes for several of the informants, hence leading to increased security. Exploring the notion of <b>function</b> <b>creep,</b> the fourth and last article addresses DNA stored in the database, investigating how and why <b>function</b> <b>creep</b> has taken place in such databases. Drawing on examples from the English and Welsh National DNA database, possible future function creeps are also discussed. The aim of the article is to elaborate on the concept of <b>function</b> <b>creep,</b> but also to enhance focus on safeguards that might render <b>function</b> <b>creep</b> on forensic DNA databases governable. While the thesis is explorative, some policy options are also discussed. Based on the empirical analyses, which point out sources of insecurity potentially generated through the use of DNA evidence and DNA databasing, it becomes evident that greater transparency and a continuing critical watchfulness are needed. Black boxing of technologies hampers transparency and watchfulness; use of second opinion, improved governance, and increase knowledge can enhance them. PhD i sosiologiPhD in Sociolog...|$|E

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the mechanical properties of uncompacted rockfill and the creep deformation behaviour of rockfill under a load as well as finding a suitable method for estimation of creep deformation behaviour, a full scale embankment loading experiment was performed. The results of this experiment were then evaluated. During {{the course of this}} study it became evident to the author that the deformations which were seen in the collected data from the experiment could be classified as creep deformations due to the linear decrease of the deformation against the logarithm of time and the study therefore came to focus on creep. One constitutive equation and one model for estimation of creep deformations were studied, and parameters were obtained through back analysis of experiment data as well as calculation of soil stresses. The creep model was based on a logarithmic approximation of the creep deformations and the creep equation was based on a power <b>function.</b> The <b>creep</b> model could also be simplified and evaluated as an equation and when a comparison was made between the equations and the measured results this showed that the logarithmic equation resulted in estimates closer to the measured deformations than what the power function did, therefore a logarithmic function is a better approximation to the deformations of the rockfill at Norvik than the power <b>function.</b> When the <b>creep</b> model was evaluated as intended, based on the soil stresses, the resulting creep estimates were less accurate, they was however still within the limits of what can be considered as admissible. The conclusion is that a logarithmic <b>function</b> describes the <b>creep</b> deformation of the rockfill at Norvik better than a power function and that the creep model by Kristensen is suitable for estimating the creep deformations. This since the creep model also provides a way of estimating deformations occurring under stress conditions other than the ones for which the creep test was performed...|$|R
