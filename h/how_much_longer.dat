The third plan is formed around the potential biological removal (PBR) concept which tells <b>how</b> <b>much</b> change {{would need to be}} done to protect the dolphins and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the dolphins' extinction is caused by humans.

She first appeared {{earlier in the}} second season, in the seventh episode, [...] "The Substitute". The role was devised for her by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of {{the release of the}} film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Paltrow was signed to Glee for two episodes, with [...] "The Substitute" [...] originally intended to feature a love quadrangle between Holly, Will, Emma and Carl. Her initial arc was, however, reduced to a single episode. Post-broadcast, Murphy said they both hoped she would appear on Glee again in the future, depending on the right storyline. In January 2011, Paltrow confirmed that she would be reprising the role. Murphy stated that she would appear in episodes fifteen and sixteen as a sex education teacher, and would serve as a love interest for Will, though she actually appeared in episodes fifteen and seventeen. Stamos also reprised his role as Emma's husband Carl. As of March 2011, he was unsure whether he would return to Glee again, but stated that he might do so to conclude Emma and Carl's storyline, explaining: [...] "I think people like me on there, but they really love Will and Emma together.

500|$|Three {{days after}} Frederick was {{confirmed}} to {{be suffering from}} cancer, his father Kaiser William I died aged 90 at 8:22 a.m. on 9 March 1888, upon which Frederick became German Emperor and King of Prussia. His son Wilhelm, now Crown Prince, telegraphed the news to his father in Italy. Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, [...] "...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense." [...] Germany's progressive elements hoped that William's death, and thus Frederick's succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines. Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either Frederick I (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or Frederick IV (if it was considered {{a continuation of the}} old Holy Roman Empire, which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia. The new Kaiser reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his [...] "pitiful" [...] appearance. The question now was <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve. In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as Emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his jacket and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as Empress. Too ill to march in his father's funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the Charlottenburg Palace.|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} {{agricultural}} livelihoods and EU {{integration in the}} Southern Carpathian Mountains of Romania. Â  I analyse how the EUâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was deployed by policy makers and elites {{in the first year}} after EU membership, and how it shaped the livelihood possibilities of tarani (peasants). Â  Given the polarised nature of Romaniaâ€™s post-socialist agrarian structure, the CAP excluded peasants from its policies, and demanded they change their exploatatii/ferme de subzistenta; (subsistence farms) into commercial farms. Â  Arguing from the premise that â€˜subsistence farmsâ€™ are actually gospodarii taranesti (peasant households) working on different principles from farms altogether, it was possible to inquire into the strategies people deployed resourcefully in their everyday work to keep making a living. I analyse EU integration as a modern political and economic project that seeks to make the radically complicated pathways of people and things â€˜transparentâ€™. Â  I pursue the question of how the neoliberal expansion of economic rationality to all spheres of life shapes the actions of people. My ethnography captures the unease people felt {{in the face of the}} current transformation of value and illustrates <b>how</b> a <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> history of devaluing peasants has been taking place. Â  It makes clear how the devaluation of peasants and their produce is part of a larger epistemological project of development and progress. Â  My analytical framework enables me to show how the effects of polarisation and externalisation have had serious consequences for the ways people think about questions of freedom, success, merit and the â€˜just stateâ€™ in Romania today. Â  My research suggests the need for a broader epistemological shift in the face of crisis, from a dominance approach towards commons thinking.
