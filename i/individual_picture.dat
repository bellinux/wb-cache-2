What can excel the telling {{of the story of}} Captain Shindy at his club,--which is, I must own, as true as it is graphic. Captain Shindy is a real snob. [...] "'Look at it, sir; is it cooked? Smell it, sir. Is it meat fit for a gentleman?' he roars out to the steward, who stands trembling before him, and who in vain tells him that the Bishop of Bullocksmithy has just had three from the same loin." [...] The telling as regards Captain Shindy is excellent, but the sidelong attack upon the episcopate is cruel. [...] "All the waiters in the club are huddled round the captain's mutton-chop. He roars out the most horrible curses at John for not bringing the pickles. He utters the most dreadful oaths because Thomas has not arrived with the Harvey sauce. Peter comes tumbling with the water-jug over Jeames, who is bringing the 'glittering canisters with bread.' ...|$|E

5000|$|In an interview, Joe Pokaski and Aron Coleite {{confirmed}} {{that there were}} discrepancies among the photo {{as a result of}} production errors. There are different versions of the full-group photo, as well as multiple versions of the sub-set photos of Kaito and Angela's death threats. One full-size version of this photo shows Bob wearing a black suit, while another version shows a man in his position wearing a tan suit. Kaito's <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> has two variations: one which has a person in a black suit standing to his left, and one with someone standing to his left wearing a tan suit. Angela's <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> has two variations: one which shows her husband standing behind her right shoulder, and one with no one standing behind her. In the large photo of the twelve, there is no [...] "cherub" [...] behind Bob's left shoulder, yet in the ripped photo with Bob, the cherub is shown. The two versions of Angela's ripped photo also have noticeably different marker thicknesses for the Symbol and ripped edges.|$|E

50|$|A traditional, front-illuminated {{digital camera}} is {{constructed}} {{in a fashion}} similar to the human eye, with a lens at the front and photodetectors at the back. This traditional orientation of the sensor places the active matrix of the digital camera image sensor—a matrix of <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> elements—on its front surface and simplifies manufacturing. The matrix and its wiring, however, reflect some of the light, and thus the photocathode layer can only receive {{the remainder of the}} incoming light; the reflection reduces the signal that is available to be captured.|$|E
50|$|Animator {{gave the}} ability to do frame-by-frame {{animation}} (creating each frame as an <b>individual</b> <b>picture,</b> much like traditional cel animation). Animator Studio also had tweening features (transforming one shape into another by letting the computer draw each in-between shape onto a separate frame). Animator and Animator Pro supported FLI and FLC animation file formats, while Animator Studio also supported the AVI format. Animator was particular strong in Palette based editing, effects (like Color cycling) and animations a favoured technology in the time of indexed CGA and VGA graphics modes.|$|E

50|$|Electrically {{operated}} display {{devices have}} developed from electromechanical systems for display of text, up to all-electronic devices capable of full-motion 3D color graphic displays. Electromagnetic devices, using a solenoid coil {{to control a}} visible flag or flap, were the earliest type, and were used for text displays such as stock market prices and arrival/departure display times. The cathode ray tube was the workhorse of text and video display technology for several decades until being displaced by plasma, liquid crystal (LCD) and solid-state devices such as LEDs and OLEDs. With the advent of microprocessors and microelectronic devices, many more <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> elements ("pixels") could be incorporated into one display device, allowing graphic displays and video.|$|E
5000|$|Claire Parker (August 31, 1906 - October 3, 1981) was an American {{engineer}} and animator. A graduate of MIT, her best-known {{contribution to the}} history of cinema is the Pinscreen (Écran d'épingles), a vertically-mounted grid of 240,000 sliding metal rods that are first manually pushed into position to create lit and shaded areas, then filmed frame by frame. While the hand-operated, mechanical Pinscreen superficially shares characteristics with early [...] "optical toys" [...] like the zoetrope, it is distinguished by being one of the first devices ever to produce animation by reconfiguring a set of <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> elements, later called pixels. Its pin [...] "resolution" [...] is sufficient to create photorealistic images, a painstaking process analogous to modern pixel art.|$|E
5000|$|... 2003 saw the {{founding}} of the fictitious factory A.G. Sinnwerke®.The first products to appear under the A.G. Sinnwerke label were the CDs, CD-Sets, and Selbstbau-Sets. More concentrated object cycles followed: CD-Roms, Samples, Ovali, Kugeln, Irrigatoren, Mona Lisa, and Sample-Sets, all offered in blister packs. Adjustable, space-consuming sculptures were made in parallel, their models presented in the form of corsets. Many ideas were captured in painting. He followed the same principle when he continued the richly varied idea of the objects in painting : Irrigatoren, Irrigatoren-Sätze, CD-Homes, Figuren, Enthüllungen, Bezüge, Seitenblicke, Antennen, Töpfe, Tempel, Angebote, CD-Stapel, Kathedralen etc.Eventually the artist provided only the material, that is, the Do-it-yourself-Baukästen, allowing the buyer to come to a personal decision about what form to use for his or her <b>individual</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E

50|$|Recent works {{deal with}} the {{capability}} of visualizing time and transience. Projects like Second Sight, Timescape and The Perennial Eye, assembled under the main title Eye on Time, document the change of the world's surface during time. In contrast to the <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> pairs of the Second Sight project, Timescape comprises photographs made during several phases. The period of observation is limited to 25 years. The project is to be completed around the year 2015 and currently consists of more than 300 series of different objects. The photographs already give {{a clear indication of}} how much the people, the places, the squares, the apartments, and even nature {{are in a state of}} change. What does not change, however, is the geographical vantage point of each photographic series and the name originally given to the object photographed.|$|E
50|$|To display {{information}} with a twisted nematic liquid crystal, the transparent electrodes are structured by photo-lithography {{to form a}} matrix or other pattern of electrodes. Only one of the electrodes has to be patterned in this way, the other can remain continuous (common electrode). For low information content numerical and alpha-numerical TN-LCDs, like digital watches or calculators, segmented electrodes are sufficient. If more complex data or graphics information have to be displayed, a matrix arrangement of electrodes is used. Obviously, the voltage controlled addressing of matrix displays, such as in LCD-screens for computer monitors or flat television screens, {{is more complex than}} with segmented electrodes. These matrix LCDs necessitate integration of additional non-linear electronic elements into each picture element of the display (e.g., thin-film diodes, TFDs, or thin-film transistors, TFTs) in order to allow the addressing of <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> elements without crosstalk (unintended activation of non-addressed pixels).|$|E
50|$|Gilpin wrote prolifically on {{the merits}} of touring the {{countryside}} of England. The naturally morose, craggy, pastoral, and untouched landscape of northern England and Scotland was a suitable endeavor for the rising middle classes, and Gilpin thought it almost patriotic to travel the homeland instead of the historically elite tour of the great European cities. One of the major commonalities of the picturesque style movement is the role of travel and its integration in designing one’s home to enhance one's political and social standing. A simple description of the picturesque is the visual qualities of Nature suitable for a picture. However, Lockean philosophy had freed Nature from the ideal forms of allegory and classical pursuits, essentially embracing the imperfections in both landscapes and plants. In this way the idea progressed beyond the study of great landscape painters like Claude Deruet and Nicolas Poussin into experimentation with creating episodic, evocative, and contemplative landscapes in which elements were combined for their total effect as an <b>individual</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E

50|$|Artificially {{generated}} microplasmas {{are found}} on the flat panel screen of a plasma display. The technology utilizes small cells and contains electrically charged ionized gases. Across this plasma display panel, there are a millions of tiny cells called pixels that are confined to form a visual image. In the plasma display panels, X and Y grid of electrodes, separated by a MgO dielectric layer and surrounded by a mixture of inert gases - such as argon, neon or xenon, the <b>individual</b> <b>picture</b> elements are addressed. They work {{on the principle that}} passing a high voltage through a low-pressure gas generates light. Essentially, a PDP {{can be viewed as a}} matrix of tiny fluorescent tubes which are controlled in a sophisticated fashion. Each pixel comprises a small capacitor with three electrodes, one for each primary color (some newer displays include an electrode for yellow). An electrical discharge across the electrodes causes the rare gases sealed in the cell to be converted to plasma form as it ionizes. Being electrically neutral, it contains equal quantities of electrons and ions and is, by definition, a good conductor. Once energized, the plasma cells release ultraviolet (UV) light which then strikes and excites red, green and blue phosphors along the face of each pixel, causing them to glow.|$|E
