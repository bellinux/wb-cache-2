25|$|Cooking with Dogs {{creator and}} {{producer}} conceived {{of the idea}} for the show upon his return to Tokyo from Los Angeles, where he had graduated from film school and worked in film and television. Interested in continuing in the industry, but unable to find success on his own and lacking a significant budget, the producer approached Chef (whose identity is also undisclosed for privacy reasons) {{with the idea of a}} cooking show. Chef was known to the producer as a <b>good</b> <b>cook,</b> and agreed to the show concept: she would cook one dish while her toy poodle Francis would be dubbed to narrate. Francis, who lives with Chef, was included to make Chef feel more comfortable and at ease on camera, as she had no background with television. Additionally, the producer felt that including a cute dog would make the series stand out to viewers. The decision for Francis to narrate in Japanese-accented English was due to the producer's desire to promote Japanese culture through English-accessible content and widen the show's appeal. The show's producer does the voice acting for Francis.|$|E

He and his best friend Popi have their own band. Rohan occasionally uses his younger sister Nikki for his personal gain, like when he uses her to make big tips while working for Kukkad Nukkad by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Dolly's friend Maya, who like him is a scatterbrain, but they broke up in Rohan in the City, when Maya had to move to Mumbai because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named Rohan Singh, but Avatar was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of [...] "Rohini Singh". Despite Avatar trying to correct this in the season two episode Can You Keep a Secret?, he accidentally changed the intended name to [...] "Rona Ping". In season three, Rohan moves into an apartment shared with Popi, but is still in the Singh house a lot.
