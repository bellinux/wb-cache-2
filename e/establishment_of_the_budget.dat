40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the output}} of a deductive research into the emergence, in OECD's countries, of a performance audit system composed of three somewhat coordinated layers: performance audit, internal audit, and internal control. The objective is to anticipate {{the emergence of a}} debate as to the implementation of such a system in federal Belgium. Two research questions are derived: a theoretical one (how to explain the emergence of the research objects?) and an empirical one (do the research objects actually emerge in OECD countries?). Part one reviews the performance audit and sociology of professions literature in search for an explanatory hypothesis. The will of synthesizing the incommensurable but equally relevant hypotheses of functionalism (public audit fulfils a given policy objective) and monopolism (public audit results from the imperialism of the accounting profession) brought forward in both fields leads to adopt Andrew Abbott's System of Profession theory as main theoretical hypothesis. In order to falsify it empirically, it is translated into the equation "Y = ABC + ABcDeF". This means that a given public administration, in order to obtain a jurisdiction like performance audit, internal audit and internal control, should first, claim it ("A"). This claim should moreover fit in a public policy ("B"). Theoretically, these two conditions are sufficient for a jurisdiction to emerge, provided that no other public administration already performs it ("C"). If this jurisdiction is already occupied ("c"), the claimant group should moreover ambit the jurisdiction ("D"), the incumbent must be perceived as having failed to perform its work on a satisfactory way ("e"), and the local system of professions should allow such shifts occurring ("F"). It is proposed to systematically confront empirical evidence from Canada and the Netherlands with this theoretical hypothesis in order to assess its explanatory value. Part two analyses seven cases in Canada. Performance audit emerges shortly after another jurisdiction related to the scientific <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> It carries with it another jurisdiction, related to the organization of the departmental production of effectiveness studies to be reviewed by the performance auditor. The latter even tries to federate both groups in a wider one of comprehensive auditors, but fails. Jurisdictions of internal audit and financial internal control are carved out of a more general management jurisdiction {{in the aftermath of a}} political scandal. Part three analyses nine cases in the Netherlands. Performance audit first fails in the absence of a professional provider. It is the delegation of the financial audit jurisdiction to public accountants that frees up the resources for developing performance audit. Internal audit is a remote consequence of this delegation: when a reform expands departmental reports to financial and management information beyond financial one, the public accountants are upgraded to internal auditors; internal control being the object of their work. In the current case study, departmental internal auditors are merging together. Aimed at sparing on financial audit work to develop consulting activities, this episode could threaten at term the performance audit jurisdiction. Part four bridges the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical evidence. After having re-examined the measurement decisions, it proceeds to the cross-case comparison. This confirms that the equation "Y = ABC + ABcDe" adequately explains the emergence of performance audit, internal audit and internal control in the public sector of OECD countries, with, however, two nuances. On the one hand, the within-case analyses have allowed deleting condition "F": theoretically suspending competition, it requires suppression because competition is an emerging phenomenon. On the other hand, the cross-case analysis indicates that conditions "C" and "c" could be deleted from the equation, with an eye on theoretical parsimony: they are somewhat implied by the relevance or not of conditions "D" and "e". But because conditions "C" and "c" allow observing the transition from a non-competitive to a competitive situation, they are kept in the equation in order to emphasize this transition. This finding that a growing share of public administrations tasks are organized in jurisdictions and that this leads over time to the emergence of a competitive system of professions inside the state is discussed as a conclusion: some further research needs on systems are identified, the insights this approach could deliver in Belgium are previewed, and the role of the discipline of public administration in this context of professionalization is considered.

In this study, a site at the Lonzée Terrestrial Observatory (candidate ICOS site) in Belgium that had been managed for more than 70 years using conventional farming practices, was monitored over three complete rotation cycles (sugar beet/winter wheat/seed potato/winter wheat) from 2004 to 2016. Continuous eddy-covariance measurements and regular biomass samplings were performed {{in order to obtain}} the daily and seasonal Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Total Ecosystem Respiration (TER), Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and Net Biome Production (NBP). Meteorological data and crop management practices were also recorded. Over the 12 crop seasons, total NEE varied both between and within crop types. Crop type influenced net carbon (C) sequestration, with the seed potato crop exhibiting the smallest C fluxes. Despite differences in CO 2 assimilation response to weather variables and in cumulated TER/GPP dynamics, the sugar beet, winter wheat and maize crops had similar seasonal NEE values. The NEE inter-annual variability, both between and within crop types, was explained mainly by <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active vegetation period, as well as the cumulated photosynthetic photon flux density and average air temperature during this period. <b>The</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C <b>budget</b> over <b>the</b> 12 years <b>of</b> study showed that NEE was a downward (negative) flux (− 4. 40 ± 0. 05 kg C m− 2), but NBP was an upward (positive) flux (0. 99 ± 0. 22 kg C m− 2).

This study was carried out during two growing periods in 2009 and 2010 in order to study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> water stress on crop growth, water consumption and dry matter yield of silage maize (Zea mays L.) supplied with flood irrigation under <b>the</b> semi-arid climate <b>of</b> Tadla in Morocco. Four to five irrigation treatments were applied at <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc) of maize. Soil water status, crop growth, leaf area index and above-ground biomass were measured. Results showed that irrigation deficit affected plant height growth, accelerated <b>the</b> senescence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves and reduced the leaf area index. <b>The</b> maximum values <b>of</b> this parameter reached at flowering under the full irrigation treatment (100 % ETc) were 5. 1 and 4. 8 in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Dry matter yields varied from 5. 3 t. ha- 1 under T 4 (40 % ETc) to 16. 4 t. ha- 1 under T 1 (100 % ETc) in 2009, whereas in 2010, it oscillated between 3. 9 t. ha- 1 under T 5 (20 % ETc) to 12. 5 t. ha- 1 under T 1 (100 % ETc). <b>The</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water <b>budget</b> by growth phase showed that the water use efficiency was higher during <b>the</b> linear phase <b>of</b> growth. Water use efficiency calculated at harvest varied between 2. 99 kg. m- 3 under T 1 to 1. 84 kg. m- 3 under T 5. The actual evapotranspiration under T 1 (100 % ETc) was 478 mm and 463 mm in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Using <b>the</b> averaged values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two years, linear relationships were evaluated between dry matter yield and water consumption ETa. The yield response factor (Ky) for the silage maize for both growth seasons was 1. 12. Under the Tadla semi-arid climate, it is proposed that silage maize should be irrigated as a priority before other crops with a Ky lower than 1. 12.
