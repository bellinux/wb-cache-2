25|$|Addresses were {{assigned}} manually. To request a <b>host</b> <b>name</b> and an address {{and add a}} computer to the master file, users contacted the SRI's Network Information Center (NIC), directed by Elizabeth Feinler, by telephone during business hours.|$|E
25|$|If all virtual servers {{belong to}} the same domain, a {{wildcard}} certificate can be used. Besides the loose <b>host</b> <b>name</b> selection that might be a problem or not, there is no common agreement about how to match wildcard certificates. Different rules are applied depending on the application protocol or software used.|$|E

5000|$|Punycode {{is a way}} to {{represent}} Unicode within the limited character subset of ASCII used for Internet <b>host</b> <b>names.</b> For example, [...] "München" [...] (German name for the city of Munich) would be encoded as [...] "Mnchen-3ya". Using Punycode, <b>host</b> <b>names</b> containing Unicode characters are transcoded to a subset of ASCII consisting of letters, digits, and hyphen (the Letter-Digit-Hyphen (LDH) subset, as it is called).|$|R
25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} <b>host</b> <b>name.</b> Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.|$|E
50|$|A Windows machine's NetBIOS {{name is not}} to be {{confused}} with the computer's Internet <b>host</b> <b>name.</b> Generally a computer running Internet protocols (whether it is a Windows machine or not) has a <b>host</b> <b>name</b> (also sometimes called a machine name). Originally these names were stored in and provided by a hosts file but today most such names are part of the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS). Generally the <b>host</b> <b>name</b> of a Windows computer is based on the NetBIOS name plus the Primary DNS Suffix, which are both set in the System Properties dialog box.|$|E
50|$|The ARPA <b>Host</b> <b>Name</b> Server Protocol (NAMESERVER), is an {{obsolete}} {{network protocol}} used in translating a <b>host</b> <b>name</b> to an Internet address. IANA Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 42 for NAMESERVER; this port is {{more commonly used}} by the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on Microsoft operating systems.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of virtual hosting, name-based and IP-based. Name-based virtual hosting uses the <b>host</b> <b>name</b> {{presented}} by the client. This saves IP addresses and the associated administrative overhead but the protocol being served must supply the <b>host</b> <b>name</b> at an appropriate point. In particular, there are significant difficulties using name-based virtual hosting with SSL/TLS. IP-based virtual hosting uses a separate IP address for each <b>host</b> <b>name,</b> {{and it can be}} performed with any protocol but requires a dedicated IP address per domain name served. Port-based virtual hosting is also possible in principle but is rarely used in practice because it is unfriendly to users.|$|E

50|$|A {{workaround}} in {{this case}} is to add the IP address and <b>host</b> <b>name</b> to the client system's hosts file. Accessing the server with the domain name should work again. Users should be careful when doing this, however, as any changes to the true mapping between <b>host</b> <b>name</b> and IP address will be overridden by the local setting. This workaround is not really useful for an average web user, but may be of some use to a site administrator while fixing DNS records.|$|E

50|$|The NetBIOS name is 16 ASCII {{characters}}, however Microsoft {{limits the}} <b>host</b> <b>name</b> to 15 characters and reserves the 16th character as a NetBIOS Suffix. This suffix describes the service or name record type such as host record, master browser record, or domain controller record or other services. The <b>host</b> <b>name</b> (or short <b>host</b> <b>name)</b> is specified when Windows networking is installed/configured, the suffixes registered {{are determined by}} the individual services supplied by the host. In order to connect to a computer running TCP/IP via its NetBIOS name, the name must be resolved to a network address. Today this is usually an IP address (the NetBIOS name to IP address resolution is often done by either broadcasts or a WINS Server - NetBIOS Name Server). A computer's NetBIOS name is often the same as that computer's <b>host</b> <b>name</b> (see below), although truncated to 15 characters, but it may also be completely different. NetBIOS names are a sequence of alphanumeric characters. The hyphen ("-") and full-stop (".") characters may also be used in the NetBIOS name, but not as the first or last character. The Windows LMHOSTS file provides a NetBIOS name resolution method {{that can be used for}} small networks that do not use a WINS server.|$|E
