5|$|On March 12, Ashbrook {{submitted}} {{a report on}} behalf of <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> recommending passage of the bill once it had been amended to reduce the authorized mintage from 200,000 to 100,000 and to add a statement that the United States government would not {{be responsible for the}} cost of the dies.|$|E
5|$|The coat of {{arms and}} the flag were created over a span of two months by Toh and <b>his</b> <b>committee.</b> A law {{establishing}} the state symbols of Singapore {{was presented to the}} National Assembly by the Minister of Culture, S. Rajaratnam, and approved in November 1959. On 3 December 1959, the state {{coat of arms}}, flag and anthem were presented to the people of Singapore for the first time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and <b>his</b> <b>Committee</b> helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
50|$|Prominent American columnists Jack Anderson and Drew Pearson were {{critical}} of Thomas and <b>his</b> <b>committee's</b> methods.|$|R

50|$|On September 21, 1975 the KBW and <b>his</b> <b>Committees</b> against § 218 {{organized}} {{a demonstration of}} 25,000 people in Bonn against the German law prohibiting abortion.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} Democratic party whip, serving under party leader Lyndon B. Johnson. In addition, he retained his {{chairmanship of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee for the 1954 election cycle. He and Democratic National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell agreed that the two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations {{in order to maximize}} donations for Democratic candidates. Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. <b>His</b> <b>committee</b> found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States from England in August 1941 to {{find out}} why Briggs and <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> were {{apparently}} ignoring the MAUD Report. Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the urgency. In these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did not have the resources to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1944 Sir Homi {{chaired the}} Bombay War Gift Fund and later {{after the war}} the Victory Thanksgiving Fund. He and <b>his</b> <b>committees</b> were {{responsible}} for raising £4m in total.|$|R
50|$|Trajtenberg {{said the}} {{government}} ignored <b>his</b> <b>committee's</b> recommendations to alleviate the housing shortage and skyrocketing prices as those issues were highlighted in the Olim L'Berlin campaign {{in the summer of}} 2014.|$|R
50|$|Anderson {{serves as}} the Ranking Member of the Commerce <b>Committee.</b> <b>His</b> other <b>committee</b> {{assignments}} include State Government, Labor and Business, and the Transportation, Infrastructure and Capital Budget Sub Committee.|$|R
5|$|The Democrats lost {{seats in}} the Senate in the 1950 {{election}} cycle, and party leader Ernest McFarland removed Clinton Anderson {{as chairman of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee, replacing him with Clements for the 1952 election cycle. Clements advocated better cooperation between <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> and the Democratic National Committee in 1952. However, Republicans won the presidency and both houses of Congress in 1952, and the Democratic National Committee talked openly of disbanding the Reelection Committee. Clements instead advised that his committee's responsibilities be expanded and that its activities become year-round rather than seasonal.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{considered}} the bill between June 22 and 24, 1965. An amendment by Rhode Island Senator John Pastore to remove silver entirely from the half dollar failed, 32—60. A number of senators wished to retain {{silver in the}} dime and quarter, and called {{for them to be}} made from 40 percent silver, but an amendment to that effect was defeated. There were other failed amendments, including one by Bible to prohibit melting of silver coins by the public. Robertson was determined to prevent any changes to the bill, which had been unanimously approved by <b>his</b> <b>committee,</b> and each attempt failed. The bill passed the Senate, 74—9, the opponents being Bible and other Western senators.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5000|$|In Ferraro's 1997 {{reshuffle}} {{of committee}} seats, {{the biggest loser}} was Nate Holden, [...] "the frequent butt of Ferraro's jokes, who was ousted from all three of <b>his</b> <b>committees</b> and given far lower-profile assignments," [...] Jodi Wilgoren reported in the Los Angeles Times.|$|R
50|$|After the Saturday Night Massacre, Rodino began <b>his</b> <b>committee's</b> investigation. On October 30, 1973, the House Judiciary Committee began {{consideration}} of the possible impeachment of Richard Nixon. The initial straight party-line votes by a 21-17 margin were focused around how extensive the subpoena powers Rodino would have would be.|$|R
50|$|Trump started {{spending}} money on the 2020 race on November 24, 2016 (only sixteen days {{after the end of}} the 2016 election). The earliest campaign disbursement that <b>his</b> <b>committees</b> reported was spent towards the 2020 presidential primaries was for the purchase of a Delta Air Lines ticket on this date.|$|R
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
50|$|In Congress, {{he served}} on the Armed Services, Small Business, Agriculture, and Merchant Marine & Fisheries <b>Committees.</b> <b>His</b> major <b>committee</b> was Armed Services. Lancaster also {{represented}} the House for six years at the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations in Geneva.|$|R

25|$|In late 1993, Yeomans {{indicated}} that <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> was considering {{the creation of}} a separate police unit to oversee the investigation of sexual assaults. He argued that change would ensure sexual assault victims would be treated with empathy by the police, as had not always occurred in the past.|$|E
25|$|Floyd Laughren tabled <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> {{report on}} January 10, 2007, making 34 {{recommendations}} for {{improvements in the}} city's municipal ward structure, communications, transportation, recreation and transit services. Rodriguez and most council members responded favourably to the report, indicating that they would attempt to implement {{as many of the}} recommendations as possible.|$|E
25|$|The Pledge was {{supposed}} to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> were against equality for women and African Americans.|$|E
5000|$|After Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in {{what has}} been called the Saturday Night Massacre, Rodino began <b>his</b> <b>{{committee}}'s</b> investigation. The committee spent eight months gathering evidence - [...] "mostly behind closed doors but with frequent news leaks" [...] - and pushed Nixon to comply with a subpoena for conversations taped in the Oval Office.|$|R
5000|$|On June 18, 2013, {{he joined}} a {{majority}} of <b>his</b> Judiciary <b>Committee</b> colleagues in voting for the [...] "SAFE Act" [...] to bolster interior enforcement of immigration laws.

50|$|In the General Assembly, Representative Watson {{has been}} a strong {{advocate}} for veterans’ rights, serving as the Republican Spokesman for the Veterans Affairs <b>Committee.</b> <b>His</b> other <b>committee</b> assignments include Financial Institutions, Elementary & Secondary Education, Telecommunications, Public Utilities (Republican Spokesperson), Gaming, and State Government Administration.|$|R
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>committee</b> {{memberships}} {{included the}} Environment and Public Works Committee, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. As {{the chairman of}} the Senate Armed Services Committee, he protected and increased the flow of billions of dollars into the Virginia economy each year via the state's military installations and shipbuilding firms which served his reelection efforts in every cycle.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{legislation}} {{proposed by}} the administration first goes before the House of Representatives. However, Roosevelt failed to consult Congressional leaders before announcing the bill, which stopped cold any chance of passing the bill in the House. House Judiciary Committee chairman Hatton W. Sumners refused to endorse the bill, actively chopping it up within <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> in order to block the bill's chief effect of Supreme Court expansion. Finding such stiff opposition within the House, the administration arranged for the bill to be taken up in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Cruikshank was a {{critical}} lobbyist for passage of Medicare. He helped eliminate any role for insurance companies as underwriters of national insurance. Medicare had been bottled up in committee for years, never having enough votes to be reported out onto either chamber's floor. After the 1964 presidential election, President Lyndon B. Johnson demanded that Rep. Wilbur Mills (D-Arkansas), chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, enlarge <b>his</b> <b>committee</b> and stack it with members who would approve Medicare. Mills co-opted the AMA and grafted Medicaid onto the bill, which then easily passed the House.|$|E
