40|$|Solidification during <b>horizontal</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> of {{low carbon}} steel billets with cyclic {{withdrawal}} was simulated and the wavy profile of the solidifying shell characteristic of this process was reproduced. Effects of rate of withdrawal cycle, superheat and casting speed were determined. In order {{to carry out this}} simulation in a personal computer, efficient numerical techniques had to be developed for mesh refinement by coordinate transformation, interfaces with temperature discontinuities and re-entrant corners. A flexible means of mesh generation involving polynomials was also developed. From the transient heat transfer model finite difference equations peculiar to each gridpoint in the solution field were derived and solved by the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method. Graphics software were developed to view the results with 3 -D as well as contour plots. The heat transfer model was verified with published results of vertical continuous casting of Mg alloys and steel. Due to its ability to deal with interfaces, unlike previous work, the present model could solve temperature at both casting and mold simultaneously. A model for the shell growth, rupture and healing at the break-ring of <b>horizontal</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> molds was incorporated into the heat transfer model.
