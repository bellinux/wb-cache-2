25|$|In Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies, Kelly {{suggests}} that knowledge {{may have been}} originally preserved by the nomadic Britons by using the landscape as a mnemonic tool, {{in a similar fashion}} to the memorization technique known as Method of loci. As the Britons started to settle, they would have needed to modify the way they stored their knowledge as they were not moving as much anymore, so they would have built Stonehenge in an attempt to replicate the landscape locally, allowing them to memorize and store knowledge. The circles and stones or timber posts would have represented the landscape, and each stone would have been associated with a segment of their <b>knowledge</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gaudet, {{provides}} a social science {{view of the}} history of peer review carefully tending to what is under investigation, here peer review, and not only looking at superficial or self-evident commonalities among inquisition, censorship, and journal peer review. It builds on historical research by Gould, Biagioli, Spier, and Rip. The first Peer Review Congress met in 1989. Over time, the fraction of papers devoted to peer review has steadily declined, suggesting that as a field of sociological study, it has been replaced by more systematic studies of bias and errors. In parallel with 'common experience' definitions based on the study of peer review as a 'pre-constructed process', some social scientists have looked at peer review without considering it as pre-constructed. Hirschauer proposed that journal peer review can be understood as reciprocal accountability of judgements among peers. Gaudet proposed that journal peer review could be understood as a social form of boundary judgement - determining what can be considered as scientific (or not) set against an overarching <b>knowledge</b> <b>system,</b> and following predecessor forms of inquisition and censorship.|$|E

2500|$|In one way, {{the tree}} of <b>knowledge</b> <b>system</b> {{reflects}} a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented {{in one way or}} another since the time of Auguste Comte, who in the 17th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both ontology and epistemology. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and depicted pictorially above), is that cosmic evolution consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely matter, life, mind, and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, cells, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, consciousness, and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also dimensions of complexity. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single [...] "cone" [...] of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four [...] "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, natural selection operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; behavioral selection operating on neuronal combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and justification operating on symbolic combinations gives rise to Culture.|$|E

50|$|Jeff Lewis brought {{together}} {{much of the}} discussion on text and textual analysis in his studies on media, culture and cultural politics. According to Lewis, 'textual studies' is the most complex and difficult heuristic method, requiring both powerful interceptive skills and a subtle conception of politics and context. Lewis' own mode of textual analysis views all phenomena as ' potential 'text' when set within a given <b>knowledge</b> <b>system.</b> Texts can only bear meaning that can be 'interpreted', therefore, as they present within a given <b>knowledge</b> <b>system.</b> This <b>knowledge</b> <b>system</b> imbues the text with meaning.
