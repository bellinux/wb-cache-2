50|$|In {{convection}} heaters, {{heating elements}} either warm the air directly or heat oil or another filler, {{which in turn}} transfers heat to the air. The air then warms the objects {{and people in the}} space. Convective heaters are suitable for providing constant, diffuse heat in well-insulated rooms. Oil heaters warm up slowly but do not reach dangerous surface temperatures; wire-element heaters, which may be <b>fan</b> <b>assisted,</b> produce warm air more quickly but may pose a fire hazard.

In this paper the performance of the ventilation system in combination with the building is studied by computer calculations with the program PFS and full-scale measurements in school buildings. A model is built and can be used in the design phase when orders of magnitude are of interest. The significance of different design features can be studied making it possible to change or alter the final design.

The objective is to examine the air flows and air directions when the exhaust windows are in different positions. This is studied by computer calculations with the program PFS. The results show that when all openings are opened as intended the required air flows are attained. When exhaust openings are opened in an unintended position, cases with very low or reverse air flow may occur. The position of the exhaust openings seems to be significant for the amount of supply air flow, implying that the position of the exhaust openings should be carefully monitored...|$|E

40|$|This study, which formed {{part of the}} Annex 35 “Hybrid Ventilation in New and Retrofitted Office Buildings ” project, was {{completed}} at LEPTAB {{and supported by the}} French Research Ministry and the ADEME (Agence De l’Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l’Energie). It consisted of modelling a typical classroom and comparing different control strategies to estimate the performance of a hybrid ventilation system for different climates. The intention was that investigated classrooms were assumed to be on the middle level of a three-storey building, oriented South and surrounded by other classrooms subjected to the same conditions. Two mechanical ventilation systems were taken as references. These were: a mechanical exhaust system with a low consumption fan and without heat recovery, and a balanced mechanical ventilation system with two fans and some heat recovery.

30|$|As central HVAC unit cannot {{cater to}} the dynamic {{schedule}} of the occupants, discomfort in NS is slightly higher than the hybrid control strategy that integrates SPOT with MPC to satisfy the comfort requirements of each individual in the building. In SA, the central HVAC system {{is aware of the}} SPOT system, therefore, the controller choses the set point temperature such that HVAC can provide minimal comfort, and SPOT can offset the individual comfort requirements. This results in additional savings in energy when there is partial occupancy is in line with the results from previous study by Rachel et al. (2018). Next, we observed that the discomfort is negligible for summer as opposed to winter. The <b>fan</b> <b>assists</b> the occupant in quickly achieving her desired comfort level as opposed to a heater which takes comparatively more time to increase the temperature to provide the offset. In conclusion, irrespective of the season, both SA and NS strategies improve comfort and energy compared to schedule-based and reactive, with SA outperforming NS.|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{the peak}} {{electrical}} use occurs during the summer. In addition, the building sector consumes {{a major portion}} of the annual electrical energy consumption. One of the main energy consuming components in the building sector is the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This research studies the feasibility of implementing a solar driven underground cooling system that could contribute to reducing building cooling loads. The developed system consists of an Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) coupled with a solar chimney that provides a natural cool draft to the test facility building at the Solar Energy Research Test Facility in Omaha, Nebraska. Two sets of tests have been conducted: a natural passively driven airflow test and a forced <b>fan</b> <b>assisted</b> airflow test. The resulting data of the tests has been analyzed to study the thermal performance of the implemented system. Results show that: The underground soil proved to be a good heat sink at a depth of 9. 5 ft, where its temperature fluctuates yearly in the range of (46. 5 °F- 58. 2 °F). Furthermore, the coupled system during the natural airflow modes can provide good thermal comfort conditions that comply with ASHRAE standard 55 - 2004. It provided 0. 63 tons of cooling, which almost covered the building design cooling load (0. 8 tons, extreme condition). On the other hand, although the coupled system during the forced airflow mode could not comply with ASHRAE standard 55 - 2004, it provided 1. 27 tons of cooling which is even more than the building load requirements. Moreover, the underground soil experienced thermal saturation during the forced airflow mode due to the oversized fan, which extracted much more airflow than the EAHE ability for heat dissipation and the underground soil for heat absorption. In conclusion, the coupled system proved to be a feasible cooling system, which could be further improved with a few design recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} of the built environment is fundamental to slowing the current increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases and hence global warming. Thermal energy storage in buildings is {{a key component of}} energy conservation and the use of phase change materials is now {{regarded as one of the}} most efficient and cost-effective ways of achieving this. Space conditioning systems using integrated phase-change materials exhibit significantly higher thermal capacities than conventional systems and are therefore able to reduce and normalize extremes of high and low temperatures within the home. Various techniques have been used over time and this thesis describes the results of spring and summer trials using microencapsulated phase-change material plasterboard to improve thermal performance in lightweight buildings. The author assisted in the design, supervision of construction, commissioning and thermal performance monitoring of a prototype lightweight manufactured park home in the warm temperate climate of Mandurah, 65 kms south of Perth, Western Australia. The microencapsulated phasechange material plasterboard was used as an integrated active and passive space heating and cooling system within the prototype. The summer trials involved the combination of using the plasterboard together with a <b>fan</b> <b>assisted</b> ventilation system; the spring trials described the use of the plasterboard together with a natural gas fire as a sensible heat source. Under cool conditions the fan ventilation system was also used to heat the building. This prototype indicates that innovative use of the new technology is a cost-effective way to improve the thermal performance and energy efficiency of housing under both summer and winter conditions. The thesis reports on the findings that have emerged from various planning, design, construction and preliminary monitoring activities. The project has verified that the costs of adding phase-change materials are viable when integrated in volume manufactured lightweight housing with the added benefits of ignificantly reduced heating cooling costs and reduced greenhouse emissions. In fact, the benefits at this early stage have proven significant enough for the village development company to incorporate the new plasterboard within the design specification of all 415 homes in their next lifestyle village currently under construction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{estimated}} that acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) account for nearly 10 % of hospital admissions and 3. 4 - 3. 8 million emergency department visits {{per year in the}} United States. Analyses of hospital discharge records indicate 74 % of ABSSSI admissions involve empiric treatment with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) active antibiotics. Analysis has shown that payer costs could be reduced if moderate-to-severe ABSSSI patients were treated to a greater extent in the observational unit followed by discharge to outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT). Oritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic with bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact on a U. S. payer's budget of using single-dose oritavancin in ABSSSI patients with suspected MRSA involvement who are indicated for intravenous antibiotics. METHODS: A decision analytic model based on current clinical practice was developed to estimate the economic value of decreased hospital resource consumption by using single-dose oritavancin over a 1 -year time horizon. Use of antibiotics was informed by an analysis of the Premier Research Database. Demographic and clinical data were derived from a targeted literature review. Emergency department, observation, laboratory, and administration costs used were Medicare National Limitation amounts. Drug costs were 2014 wholesale acquisition costs. RESULTS: For a hypothetical U. S. payer with 1, 000, 000 members, it is expected that approximately 14, 285 members per year will be diagnosed with ABSSSI severe enough to indicate intravenous antibiotics with MRSA activity. Based on this simulation, use of single-dose oritavancin in 26 % of these patients was estimated {{to reduce the number of}} inpatient admissions, reduce length of stay for patients requiring admission, and reduce the number of days a patient needs to receive daily infusions in the OPAT clinic. The total patient days decreased from 171, 125 to 133, 435 with a total annual budget impact of -$ 12, 550, 000 or -$ 1. 05 per member per month (PMPM). Total inpatient and outpatient costs were reduced by $ 9, 970, 000 (19. 7 %) and $ 2, 580, 000 (4. 2 %), respectively. Inpatient cost savings were derived from a reduction in admissions, length of stay, and lower drug administration burden. Outpatient costs were reduced by lower drug administration burden in the OPAT setting. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to population estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Use of single-dose oritavancin in moderate-to-severe ABSSSI patients, including those with suspected MRSA, was projected to deliver an estimated cost reduction to U. S. payers of $ 1. 05 PMPM by avoiding hospitalization in appropriate patients and reducing outpatient costs associated with multiday parenteral antibiotic therapy.
