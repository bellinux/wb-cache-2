40|$|Abstract—Wire bonding is {{the most}} popular method to connect signals between dies in System-in-Package (SiP) design nowadays. Pad assignment, which assigns inter-die signals to <b>die</b> <b>pads</b> so as to {{facilitate}} wire bonding, is an important physical design problem for SiP design because the quality of a pad assignment solution affects both the cost and performance of a SiP design. In this paper, we study a pad assignment problem, which prohibits the generation of illegal crossings and aims to minimize the total signal wirelength, for die-stacking SiP design. We first consider the two-die cases and die-stacks with a bridging die, and present a minimum-cost flow based approach to optimally solve them in polynomial time. We then describe an approach, which uses a modified left edge algorithm and an integer linear programming technique, for pyramid die-stacks with no bridging die. Finally, we discuss extensions of the two approaches to handle additional design constraints. Encouraging experimental results are shown to support our approaches.

40|$|Interface {{delamination}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues in the microelectronic packaging industry. Silver filled die attach is a typical adhesive used between the die and copper <b>die</b> <b>pad</b> for its improved heat dissipation capacity. Delamination between die attach and <b>die</b> <b>pad</b> will severely impact the heat conduction and result in product failure. In order to predict this delamination, interface properties should be characterized. Tri-material, copper-die attach-EMC, samples are made according to the package processes. A four point bending test system is established in order to perform delamination tests at different temperaturesusing a universal tester Zwick/Roell Z 005. In addition, a Keyence optical system is mounted to capture a series of pictures during the delamination processes. This will provide the delamination geometry information needed for determining the interface properties. Four point bending tests have been performed at room temperature, 40, 60, 85, and 150 C respectively. In addition pre conditioning sample arealso tested at room temperature and 85 C respectively after 48 hours pre conditioned at 85 C/ 85 %RH. Experiments show that the critical delamination load decreases steadily with temperature increasing. Experiments also show moisture has no effects on the critical delamination load compared with the dry samples tested at the same temperatures. This meansthat moisture has no effects on the interface toughnessbetween copper and die attach. To quantify the interface properties, numerical simulations of the four point bending test have been performed by using a finite element model comprising cohesive zone elements which will describe the transient delamination process during the four point bending tests. Correspondently, the interface toughness decreases from 26. 5 J/m 2 at room temperature to 1. 9 J/m 2 at 150 C as calculated from the cohesive zone element model. These results show that temperature has a large effect on theinterface toughness. By means of an extensive modelparameter sensitivity study, combined with the measureddelamination length in horizontal direction along the copper-die attach interface at room temperature critical opening value has been determined...|$|E

40|$|Wire bonding failures, {{including}} non-stick on <b>die</b> <b>pad</b> (bond-off) and smash ball of {{the first}} bond, are often encountered in manufacturing of miniaturized packages with increased feature density and higher UPH requirement. Many researches have been conducted with an attempt to solve these issues. However, these studies mainly focused on the correlations between bonding pad qualities and robust ball bonding solutions. Few of them investigated these failures from a mechanical point of view, such as deflection of leadframe under vertical bonding force. For today's small outline transistor (SOT) packages, the leadframe has low profiles and complex structures, which makes the wire bonding response very complex and difficult to be predicted. This paper demonstrated that the deflection of leadframe at the first bond position {{played an important role}} on the bond-off failure for SOT packages. When the deflection was larger than 5 μm at critical bonding locations, severe bond-off failure occurred. By applying finite element analysis, some ways to reduce this deflection thus eliminating the risk of bond-off failure were discussed and verified by experiments, which include leadframe structure modification at some local areas, change of supporting tape types, and lowering of bonding temperature.

In this work, the effect of temperature ramp rate on flip-chip anisotropically conductive adhesive joint quality and reliability has been studied. The experiments were performed on bumped and unbumped die. They were assembled onto bare ITO-glass and FR- 4 substrates. The reason for using the transparent glass substrate is that the particle deformation and settlement can be visualised without destroying the assembled module. The temperature ramp rates studied ranged between 8. 1 and 65. 7 °C/s. The experiments show that the best joint quality is obtained when a slow temperature ramp rate is applied to unbumped dies. A good joint is achieved when many particles have been entrapped on the <b>die</b> <b>pad</b> and when there is a significant degree of particle deformation. A large degree of deformation of particles results in a large contact area for the electrical conduction path. When a high temperature ramp rate is applied, there is a risk that the adhesive is already cured before full compression is reached. This will prevent the particles in the adhesive from contacting the bonding surface. When assembling bumped die, the temperature ramp rate {{does not seem to have}} a significant influence on the result. The joint quality evaluation has been performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Microscopy (OM). Furthermore, temperature cycling between - 40 to + 125 °C, 1000 cycles, has been performed to characterise the joint reliability under the optimum temperature ramp rate conditions. The electrical resistance has been measured continuously. A theoretical simulation of the influence of the temperature ramp rate on the adhesive joint quality has been performed using the same test module conditions as for the experimental work. The results coincide with the experimental results, particularly in the range of low bonding pressure value...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{developing a}} knowledge based fast qualification method for moisture or thermally induced failure in microelectronic packages. Driven {{by the market}} competition {{and the need for}} shorter time to market, fast qualification tests {{are becoming more and more}} important for the industry. Qualifications are tests which are used in the industry to estimate the lifetime reliability of an electronic package and their ability to fulfil their engineering requirement. Since the traditional trial-and-error method is still commonly used during product and process development for design and qualification, these qualification tests are too time consuming and will result in long design cycles. Moisture and thermal-mechanical related qualification tests are selected for this work since they are responsible for the most of the failures in the electronic packages. More specifically moisture sensitivity level analysis (MSLA) and thermal cycling, which are related to the moisture and thermal-mechanical qualification tests, are chosen in this research. Although MSLA tests consist of two stages: moisture diffusion and reflow (heating to maximum of 260 ºC at solder reflow condition), only moisture diffusion is studied for MSLA as the moisture diffusion stage accounts for almost all of the duration needed for MSLA test. Furthermore, since it has been known that moisture diffusion rate increases significantly with increasing temperature and humidity, an accelerated condition of 85 ºC/ 85 %RH pre-conditioning is chosen. This corresponds to the worst condition in the JEDEC standard J-STD- 020 D and hence the highest acceleration. Furthermore, two different qualifying criterions are used in this research to quantify the accelerated condition. They are equal weight gain and equal local moisture concentration and significant acceleration factor has been achieved with these criterions. Compared with the traditional and 60 ºC/ 60 %RH pre-conditioning, the moisture absorption time for equal moisture weight gain is shortened by a factor of 16 to 112 if only moisture weight gain is used as a qualifying criterion. Although not as high, the acceleration factor of 2 to 17 can be achieved even if a more stringent criterion of the local moisture concentration is considered. Another advantage of using only one accelerated condition is such that it minimizes the need to maintain different humidity chambers for different MSL. This not only simplify the testing procedures but additional time could be reduced since all the test at their level can be performed together. Another aspect of this research is to develop advanced characterization technique that is need to support the moisture and thermal mechanical simulation. This is critical as it will not only speed up the characterization processes which is normally very time consuming, it is able to increases their accuracy too. For example, RH% steps at constant temperature methodology developed in this research could not only reduce the time duration needed for moisture diffusion characterization, it is also able to produce a much more accurate result. At least four days can be shortened using this method to characterize the moisture properties needed for fast moisture diffusion. Furthermore, the DMA plus moisture generator method is found to be more efficient than that of traditional TGA/TMA method used to determine moisture induced expansion. Compared to the regular TGA/TMA method, the CME characterization time is shortened from 210 hours to 42 hours. Thermal cycling qualification is a test to determine the ability of the package to withstand mechanical stresses induced by cycling between two temperature extremes. Traditionally, these thermal cycling qualification test is very time consuming since it requires up to a few thousands of thermal cycles depending on the engineering requirements. In order to shorten the thermal cycling cycles, a knowledge based thermal cycling fast qualification method is also developed. For thermally induced failure, faster thermal cycling qualification can be obtained with the aid of simulations. In this research, delamination between die attach and copper <b>die</b> <b>pad</b> is identified as the dominant failure mode during thermal cycling test. A transient delamination simulation based on cohesive zone method is implemented to predict the number of cycles needed for delamination. However, as with any simulation, meaningful delamination prediction can only be achieved with accurate input properties. Hence, interface properties (interface toughness and critical opening) between copper <b>die</b> <b>pad</b> and die attach where the delamination occur is investigated in this research. The die attach-copper interface toughness as function of temperature is characterized by using both four point bending experiments and numerical simulations and the result shows that the interface toughness decreases significantly with increasing temperature. Lastly, the critical opening value at room temperature is determined in this research using experimental results and cohesive zone simulations. Our simulation result shows that delamination occurs at a early stage in their fatigue life but these delamination cracks will stabilize at around 20 cycles. This is consistent with our experimental measurement performed using sample cross sectioning technique. Furthermore, good agreements on delamination location and length have been also observed between the prediction and experimental measurement. The study shows the cycles needed for delamination is reduced from up to 1500 cycles to 20 cycles with this qualification strategy. In conclusion, this research provides a framework in developing a knowledge based fast qualification method which can shorten qualification time and design cycles for different electronic packages. Moisture diffusion time can be largely shortened if this method is used whereas our thermal cycling qualification can be significantly shorten our test duration.

40|$|In {{the printed}} circuit board {{assembly}} (PCBA) industry, integrated circuit (IC) dies are attached onto the {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) with epoxy. The <b>die</b> <b>pads</b> are first connected to the PCB tracks with gold or aluminium wires, utilising an ultrasonic wire-bonding machine. The dies are then coated with thermally cured epoxy. The chip-on-board (COB) is finally placed in an electrical oven for baking at certain temperature for a certain period of time, depending upon the type of epoxy used, until the adhesive is completely cured. The baking process using an electrical oven is time-consuming and costly. An alternative way of curing the epoxy is desirable searched. A variable frequency microwave (VFM) source is identified as the possible solution. The first step in curing the epoxy using VFM heating is to find out the best frequency to process the materials in microwaves and this is termed as 'characterisation' of the epoxy by the VFM oven manufacturers. Two VFM facilities were employed to perform the characterisation. One is in the frequency range of 2 – 8 GHz and the other is in the frequency range of 6. 5 – 18 GHz. By using these two facilities, the best frequency range to process an epoxy by VFM can be identified. Two high quality and commonly epoxy resins, Uniset adhesive and Hysol encapsulant were chosen for consideration. The two resins were then characterised by VFM facilities. From the graphs of the characterisation, a better resin of the two can be identified. ...|$|R
40|$|M. A. Language, {{specifically}} the narrative use of language, {{is not only}} a medium through which people express and understand themselves. Language is the vehicle wherein and whereby personal identity is constituted. Thus, identity is not seen as fixed, but as a product-in-process of narrative discourse. The interrelationship between narrative and personal identity can be observed in a person`s almost inborn urge to mentally reconstruct his lifestory. Narratives supply personal identity with continuity and cohesion. Ricoeur`s description of the instance of “mimesis” – narratives are “mimesis” in the sense of being the representation of an action – is used to explain the construction of two selfnarratives (Griet Swart in Griet skryf `n sprokie and Stoffel Mathysen in <b>Die</b> lang <b>pad</b> van Stoffel Mathysen). Ricoeur`s two “functions” of narrative, i. e. to expose and to transform, are considered. Griet Swart`s narrative identity is constituted by her being situated in a tradition (mimesis 1) – that of being writer of fairy-tales as well as reader of literature. Drawing on conventions and prior knowledge, a plot is created (mimesis 2), in which Griet narrates her lifestory. The narration, the perspective on a patriarchal society as well as the continuous redefining of narrative identity by means of the writing process, are examined. The act of writing becomes metaphor for personal freedom. In <b>Die</b> lang <b>pad</b> van Stoffel Mathysen the use of the epic hero figure, travel prose, Western literature, hunting prose and the outobiography are examined in order to understand Mathysen`s narrative construction of personal identity. Both Griet and Mathysen reconfigure personal identity by means of narrative. It is this process of constant change in self-understanding that Ricoeur calls “narrative identity”...|$|R
40|$|Abstract‘Suffering’ is {{a central}} discursive trope for the right-to-die movement. In this article, we ask how proponents of physician-assisted <b>dying</b> (<b>PAD)</b> {{articulate}} suffering {{with the role of}} medicine {{at the end of life}} within the context of a decriminalization and legalization debate. We draw upon empirical data from our study of Carter v. Canada, the landmark court case that decriminalized PAD in Canada in 2015. We conducted in-depth interviews with 42 key participants of the case and collected over 4000 pages of legal documents generated by the case. In our analysis of the data, we show the different ways proponents construct relationships between suffering, mainstream curative medicine, palliative care, and assisted dying. Proponents see curative medicine as complicit in the production of suffering at the end of life; they lament a cultural context wherein life-prolongation is the moral imperative of physicians who are paternalistic and death-denying. Proponents further limit palliative care's ability to alleviate suffering at the end of life and even go so far as to claim that in some instances, palliative care produces suffering. Proponents' articulation of suffering with both mainstream medicine and palliative care might suggest an outright rejection of a place for medicine at the end of life. We further find, however, that proponents insist on the involvement of physicians in assisted dying. Proponents emphasize how a request for PAD can set in motion an interactive therapeutic process that alleviates suffering at the end of life. We argue that the proponents' articulation of suffering with the role of medicine at the end of life should be understood as a discourse through which one configuration of end-of-life care comes to be accepted and another rejected, a discourse that ultimately does not challenge, but makes productive use of the larger framework of the medicalization of dying...|$|R
