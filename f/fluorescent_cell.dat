40|$|A {{quantitative}} assay for infective {{variola virus}} particles was developed {{which is based}} on the enumeration of <b>cells</b> containing <b>fluorescent</b> viral antigen after infection of McCoy cell monolayers. The direct fluorescent-antibody technique was employed to stain cells. The efficiency of virus adsorption was markedly enhanced by centrifugation of virus inoculum onto McCoy cell monolayers at 500 × g for 15 min. By this procedure, a proportionality was obtained between the number of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> and volume of inoculum. Observations on the sequential development of viral antigen within cells and counts of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> showed that the optimal time for enumerating <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> was after an incubation period of 16 to 20 hr.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{determine}} what factors control the differentiation of certain neural crest cells in the chick embryo. Emphasis was placed on the morphologically and biochemically divergent sensory and sympathetic pathways of differentiation. Embryos were precisely staged according to Hamburger & Hamilton (1951) and it was observed that sensory ganglia with somites, explanted at stages 21 - 24, gave rise to cells showing formalde-hyde-induced fluorescence in more than 25 % of explants. These cells were identical in properties to the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> of the sympathetic system of embryos of similar age, and appeared by 12 days in vitro. These <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> did not appear when somites and sensory ganglia explants were maintained separately. The incidence of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> in combined explants was considerably reduced or absent when cultures were maintained for 7 days or less, or when the explants were obtained from stage 25 - 26 embryos. Furthermore, when neural tube was also included in the cultures, the appearance of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> was markedly inhibited. The requirement for somitic tissue to induce <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> in combined explants can be replaced by forelimb-bud tissue.

On Arthus phenomenon at 24 hours after the provocating injection, although the fluorescence was observed in swollen connective tissue, {{the range of the}} fluorescence was narrow and weak on the operated side.

40|$|Cultured Burkitt {{cells were}} {{examined}} by immunofluorescence, autoradiography, and electron microscopy {{in an effort}} to identify the stainable cells with those harboring herpes-type virus particles. Immediately after a 2 -hr pulse of 3 H-thymidine, from 30 to 60 % of the cells revealed heavy nuclear labeling. In most cases the grains were evenly dispersed, but in about 3 to 5 % the grains showed a focal distribution and occasionally they extended into the cytoplasm. Such nuclear foci were rarely seen at 8 hr after the pulse. When the analysis was restricted to preselected immunofluorescent cells, up to 80 % showed label at 8 hr and cytoplasmic grains were prominent. To reduce cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, cells were X-irradiated with 3, 000 to 6, 000 R, and the isotope pulse was applied 1, 4, or 7 days later. Whereas the total number of labeled cells decreased in roughly twofold steps at the respective intervals (from 40 to 10 %), the incorporation of 3 H-thymidine into <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> was not affected by X irradiation. In each series, about 70 % of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> contained label when they were examined at 24 and 48 hr after the pulse, whereas at 8 and 72 hr fewer were positive. At the earlier intervals, unlabeled <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> most likely represented cells which had completed viral DNA synthesis prior to the pulse; at the later intervals, unlabeled <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> were probably cells which commenced viral replication after the pulse. These data support the conclusion that the immunofluorescent cells are the ones which harbor virus, and also confirm the expectation that the virus is a DNA virus from a member of the herpes group. This conclusion was firmly established by sectioning and electron microscopic examination of individual <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells,</b> all of which contained numerous virus particles, whereas the nonstained cells prepared in a similar manner were free of them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cell fusion {{induced by}} {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) is an efficient but poorly controlled procedure for obtaining somatic cell hybrids used in gene mapping, monoclonal antibody production, and tumour immunotherapy. Genetic selection techniques and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cell</b> sorting are usually employed to isolate cell fusion products, but both procedures have several drawbacks. Results Here we describe a simple improvement in PEG-mediated cell fusion that {{was obtained by}} modifying the standard single-step procedure. We found {{that the use of}} two PEG undertreatments obtains a better yield of cell fusion products than the standard method, and most of these products are bi- or trinucleated polykaryocytes. Fusion rate was quantified using <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cell</b> staining microscopy. We used this improved cell fusion and cell isolation method to compare giant cells obtained in vitro and giant cells obtained in vivo from patients with Hodgkin's disease and erythroleukemia. Conclusions In the present study we show how to improve PEG-mediated cell fusion and that cell separation by velocity sedimentation offers a simple alternative for the efficient purification of cell fusion products and to investigate giant cell formation in tumor development. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> in the draining lymph nodes of mice painted with the contact sensitizing agent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was investigated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Up to 30 % of the <b>cells</b> were <b>fluorescent</b> after 18 h and this decreased thereafter becoming undetectable after 4 - 5 days. Most of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> were morphologically lymphocytes, theta - ve and adherent to nylon wool. Immunogenicity of these cells was tested by injecting {{them into the}} footpads of normal mice and measuring contact sensitivity after 6 days. This was restricted to large cells which represented less than 5 % of the white cell population and nearly all of which became fluorescent after skin painting. The large <b>fluorescent</b> <b>cells</b> were a mixture of monocytes and lymphocytes. Most of the lymphocytes had surface immunoglobulin. The immunogenicity was reduced by nylon filtration but was not affected by silica and anti-theta. These {{results showed that the}} immunogenicity is not associated with T cells. In contrast, similar immunogenic activity in the draining lymph nodes of mice painted with oxazolone is associated with T cells. The results therefore showed that different sensitizers form immunogenic complexes with different cell populations, perhaps in this case becuase of the different water solubilities of FITC and oxazolone. They also suggested that this may cause important differences in antigen presentation, for example in their association with different MHC products...|$|R
