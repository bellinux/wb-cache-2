A psychologically real phonological general-ization is characterized as one which appl ies to an open lexical domain. When a phonological generalization is formulable independent-ly of specific lexical items, the generalization is said to express a true statement about the sound system of the language. A behavioral interpretation typically appl ied on this character-ization of a psychologically real phonological generalization is that speakers will make use of the generalization in the derivation of novel forms; if it is shown that they in fact do, this demonstration is then considered to be evidence for the psychological reality of the generalization.

40|$|International audienceMobile {{wireless}} sensors need to {{know their}} local- <b>izations</b> in many control and monitoring applications. Among all sensors, some know their exact position (i. e., they are equipped with GPS or they are positioned by human intervention). These sensors are called anchors. Some sensors can have different capabilities allowing them to calculate either distances or angles when they receive messages from others nodes. So, they only use anchor positions to obtain an estimated position. However, when sensors are mobile they cannot continuously calculate their position because of the energy constraints. This paper concerns the localization problem in the case where all nodes in the network (anchors and others sensors) are mobile. We propose three techniques following the capabilities of nodes. Thus, each node obtains either an exact position or an approximate position {{with the knowledge of}} the maximal error born. Also, we adapt the periods where nodes invoke their localization.

40|$|Wage {{and price}} {{controls}} {{have a long}} and somewhat disreputable history, presumably because of their frequent use in many countries as short run substitutes for measure~ with more lasting effects on the inflation rate. But, in 1985 and 1986, Argentina, Brazil, and Israel used extensive wage-price controls as part of more comprehensive disinflation programs,. often labeled "heterodox" stabilization programs. To date, the Israeli stabilization seems to have succeeded, while the Argentinean and Brazilian stabi 1 <b>izations</b> have clearly ended in failure. This experience raises many questions. One view is that controlling one nominal variable, namely the money supply, is enough to bring down inflation provided that sound fiscal policies are also adopted. Therefore, wage and price controls should be avoided, because of their microeconomic costs. It is clear that controls do have microeconomic costs, but can they also have macroeconomic benefits?
