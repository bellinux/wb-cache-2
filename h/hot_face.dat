6000|$|... "A dreadful {{accident}} on the railroad, {{just the other}} side of Croydon. News telegraphed half an hour ago," [...] answered the man, wiping his <b>hot</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If he doesn't {{come soon}} {{he might as}} well stay away altogether," [...] said Jimmy, who turned in tense {{suspense}} and watched the <b>hot</b> <b>faces</b> of the men about him.|$|R
60|$|With that {{he helped}} her in. The others obediently {{followed}} their capricious leader, {{and in a moment}} they were floating down the river, with a fresh wind cooling their <b>hot</b> <b>faces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For a <b>hot</b> surface <b>facing</b> down, or a cold surface facing up, for laminar flow: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{pull you}} {{right out of}} this window," [...] he said, roughly, and then with his <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> pressed against hers tried to {{accomplish}} the thing he threatened.|$|E
60|$|She {{bent over}} Thorne and laid {{her hands on}} his <b>hot</b> <b>face.</b> Then she rose--a woman such as he had {{imagined}} she might be in an hour of trial.|$|E

6000|$|... 'There, I {{knew you}} would turn round!' he said, his <b>hot</b> angry <b>face</b> invaded by a smile in which his teeth showed like white hemmed in by red at chess.|$|R
60|$|He {{made the}} cannon; but {{something}} in his <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> suggested {{that it had been}} a nervous strain, and he turned to the table at once to refill his glass.|$|E

60|$|The happy mother {{raised the}} hem of Miss Mary's skirts to her lips. She would have buried her <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> in its virgin folds, but she dared not. She rose to her feet.|$|E

60|$|Harding laughed, but led her on, and {{presently}} {{they met}} the advancing rain. It beat, wonderfully refreshing, on their <b>hot</b> <b>faces,</b> and soon Beatrice's thin dress was soaked. Steam {{rose from the}} parched earth; there was a hothouse smell, a dull roar, and a rustle among the beaten grass, and the fading light was shut off by a curtain of falling water. Alternating between happy laughter and silence, during which their thankfulness became too deep for speech, they hurried toward Harding's farm, and Beatrice threw her arms round Hester's neck when she met her at the door.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've spoilt her," [...] said he, {{taking her}} from me with good humour, and kissing her little <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> and burning lips. [...] "Polly, {{you care for}} me more than for papa, now--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{always said}} you had Annette Kellerman beat a mile," [...] Billy said; and so proud was his air of {{possession}} that Saxon blushed and trembled, and hid her <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> against his breast.|$|E
60|$|Duane's last fading {{sensations of}} that hard day were the strange {{feel of a}} bed, a relief at the removal of his heavy boots, and of Jennie's soft, cool hands on his <b>hot</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "There was no pain, no sting or smart. Amazement {{and then}} {{darkness}} sweeping over everything. The <b>hot,</b> brutal <b>face</b> before me, {{the face of}} the man who had killed me, seemed to recede. It swept out of existence--" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{mosquito}} {{door swung}} {{back with a}} crash and Ellice appeared in the entrance with a <b>hot,</b> angry <b>face,</b> and hands smeared with dough, her hair hanging partly loose in disorder about her neck, her skirt ungracefully kilted up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I like Latin, {{and used}} to get on well when I studied it with Jimmy. Perhaps I can help you a little bit," [...] said Polly, as Tom wiped his <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> and {{refreshed}} himself with a peanut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! here’s Hartley," [...] {{said the}} tall captain, {{with an air}} of relief, as Captain Trimblett turned and {{revealed}} a <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> mottled and streaked with red. [...] "Make him listen to reason. He won’t do it for me.|$|E
6000|$|Ann {{dropped the}} poker into the fender with some éclat {{and stood up}} and looked at her <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> in the glass. Kipps' {{disappointment}} grew. [...] "You did ought to 'ave known better than that, Ann! You reely did." ...|$|E
50|$|The Turkey Devonshire sandwich, {{sometimes}} simply {{called a}} Devonshire, originated in 1934 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is typically {{served as a}} <b>hot</b> open <b>faced</b> sandwich on toasted bread with hot turkey, bacon, tomatoes, and a cheese sauce. The sandwich {{is similar to a}} Kentucky Hot Brown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Dearborn," [...] he called, [...] "I {{think you}} are a great deal too far from shore, {{and you must be}} getting very tired and <b>hot.</b> Your <b>face</b> is greatly flushed. I will hurry along and see if I can find a good place for you to stop and cool yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|Festus, seeing this, {{enlarged}} himself wrathfully, got <b>hot</b> in the <b>face,</b> {{rose to his}} feet, {{and glared}} down upon them like a turnip-lantern.|$|R
60|$|And when Jessie {{proceeded}} to tack in her clean collar and cuffs, Grace called out, raising her <b>hot</b> <b>face</b> from her work, {{that they might}} be pinned in on Sunday morning; it was only waste of time to do so now.|$|E
6000|$|... "All this I learned afterward; then I unconsciously piped away till {{my job was}} done, {{wiped my}} <b>hot</b> <b>face,</b> and went in to get my money. To my {{surprise}} I was told to 'go into the dining room, and missis would attend to it.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} wore away; twilight fell; night came; {{and then}} Madeline rose {{to sit by}} the window to let the cool wind blow upon her <b>hot</b> <b>face.</b> She passed through hours of unintelligible shame and impotent rage and futile striving to reason away her defilement.|$|E
