Branagh stated the footage contains [...] "things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill {{in a little bit}} of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research." [...] In its first week of release, Thor took the number one spot on Blu-ray/DVD sales chart and topped Home Media Magazines rental chart for the week.|$|E
500|$|Little Mix {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of [...] "Wings" [...] with songwriter Iain James and production team TMS, although they invited input from other writers until they found the track complete. It {{was one of the}} first songs written for the group's debut studio album, DNA. Unlike most The X Factor (UK) alumni, the band were adamant on being involved with the writing of their first original single. Band member Perrie Edwards stressed, [...] "At the end of the day, it's our name on it. If we're not happy, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> see straight through it." [...] Simon Cowell, owner of Little Mix's label Syco Music, also advised the group that the single would benefit from their own input.|$|E

Hayes said: [...] "I'm proud of {{being a part of}} {{something}} in history and I'm proud to have been given a platform to make people laugh." [...] McCormack added, [...] "We have never taken ourselves or this show too seriously but now that it's over I take our collective achievement very, very seriously." [...] The actors were satisfied with the episode and thought the viewers would find it satisfying as well. [...] "It's daring and ambitious and more far-reaching than most finales go. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be quite surprised," [...] McCormack said. Messing added: [...] "I think Will & Grace fans will be satisfied. Ultimately, [...] was done beautifully and it ties up loose ends for all of the characters in a way that's wonderful." ...|$|E

"One of {{the biggest}} things that I wanted to do on this album was make people realize why {{they fell in love}} with me {{in the first place and}} then take them on a journey to where I am now musically.

2500|$|On 19 January 2009, Bellamy {{completed}} his move to Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal {{for an undisclosed}} fee believed to be around £14 million On signing for the club his new manager Mark Hughes stated, [...] "I'm sure Craig will be excellent for us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> soon see why I wanted {{to bring him to}} the club. The fee that gets mentioned is invariably the wrong figure, it keeps being quoted as £19million, {{but that was not the}} price we paid for him." [...] This took his career total of transfers to £47m. Bellamy became the second major signing by Manchester City of the transfer window after Wayne Bridge from Chelsea.|$|E
2500|$|Before Slumdog Millionaire was released, Patel {{auditioned for}} the role of Zuko by {{submitting}} a tape to the studio. Shyamalan called Patel personally to inform him that he got the part. Training for the film was intense, as he had to learn Wushu and different martial arts. Patel recalls fighting, punching, and throwing and said the experience was [...] "truly amazing." [...] While he was filming Slumdog in India, he would finish a take and turn one of the channels over to the animated series. Even though it is based on a cartoon, he wanted to bring as much of himself as possible to the character he was portraying. Shaun Toub, who was cast as Iroh, describes his character in the first film as [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "free". He compares Zuko's [...] "obsession" [...] to his childhood memories and how kids are always looking for their parents' approval, saying that Zuko just wants his father's. [...] "He isn't necessarily bad, he just {{has a great deal of}} built up anger and forgets to consider others. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> understand that he's not bad, he's just angry and hurting because he really wants his father to love him, but his father is too busy with other things." [...] He says that Patel is an [...] "18 year old with all this energy," [...] and that Patel was able to influence him into appreciating the business of filmmaking more. While comparing the animated series to the film, he says the film is much more serious. He attributed this change to the director trying to relate to every age group, rather than just kids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{realistic}} {{approach to the}} series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by Colleen Atwood. According to Amell, {{it was important for}} the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: [...] "If I can put it on by myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> buy it. And that was our idea. That's our world." ...|$|R

I don't know when it'll come out, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it'll be more deep. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> like it." [...] He added by saying, [...] "It's {{going to be}} way more deep. In terms of the topics, and the songwriting, it's {{going to be very}} minimal in the way of arranging the music.

[...] On a similar note, on August 9, 2006, the sculpture The Presidential Bust of Hillary Rodham Clinton: The First Woman President of the United States of America was unveiled at the Museum of Sex in New York and attracted attention for its named focus; sculptor Daniel Edwards {{hoped it would}} spark discussion about sex, politics and celebrity.|$|R
2500|$|He put Death on hold {{after this}} to {{continue}} Control Denied, {{which he had}} been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the [...] "supergroup" [...] Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track [...] "As Ancients Evolve" [...] as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked {{to be one of the}} many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence [...] "...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{opened to}} highly {{positive}} reviews. Several media organizations praised Aamir Khan for his effort {{and described the}} show as a movement. In her review, Ritu Singh of IBN Live stated, [...] "Aamir Khan deserves an applause for bringing up such a sensitive issue and presenting it in a hard hitting way. The amount of research Aamir and his team has put into the show was clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issue was covered with great diligence." [...] She concluded it by saying, [...] "'Satyamev Jayate' {{is not just a}} show; it’s a movement to change people’s mindset." [...] Parmita Uniyal from Hindustan Times praised the content and format of the show and said, [...] "Aamir Khan have to step in to do what journalists are supposed to do– make a difference. The show {{is a classic example of}} that." [...] Gayatri Sankar from Zee News described the show as an [...] "eye opener" [...] and commented that, [...] "Satyamev Jayate will make you unlearn all the wrong you have learnt and discover that compassionate human your soul wishes to be. The show grips you and leaves you dumfounded! You will be left asking for more and would wish the show never ends." [...] Trade analyst and film critic Komal Nahta commended that, [...] "I cried while watching the show. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> watch it as it has touched an emotional chord." [...] Neeraj Roy, managing director and chief executive of Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, also praised the show by commending [...] "Brilliant effort. Well done Aamir Khan and Satyamev Jayate. We can make a difference." [...] Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com expressed concerns regarding the show saying, [...] "This is a grand initiative and a sound format into which a lot has been invested -- monetarily as well as in terms of research. Deriding this show simply because it is hosted by a Bollywood actor who is also a marketing whiz, questions our credibility, not his." ...|$|E
5000|$|When it {{came time}} to design the look of the costume for Oliver Queen's vigilante persona, the studio brought in Colleen Atwood to develop a {{realistic}} approach to the suit.

50|$|I {{was being}} optimistic about 25 years really. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{its going to}} be cultic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> always <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be reading them {{but it will be a}} small group of people. Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range... To read a novel {{requires}} a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you dont read the novel really. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by—its hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities.|$|R
5000|$|At a {{press conference}} held at the Yes for Wales Campaign, Pedley again argued Conservatives to vote Yes and warned that the party would face {{oblivion}} in Wales {{if it did not}} take advantage of the opportunity and denounced talk of a Conservative boycott of the Assembly.

"I invented Hallery {{to get rid}} of myself, but, after all, Hallery {{is really}} no more than the shadow of myself, and if I were impersonal and well bred, and if I spoke behind a black screen, it would still be as much my voice as ever. I do not see how it is {{possible}} to prevent the impersonal things coming by and through persons; but at any rate we can begin to recognize that the person who brings the message is only in his way like the messenger-boy who brings the telegrams. The writer may have a sensitive mind, the messenger-boy may have nimble heels; that does not make him the creator of the thing that comes. Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be able to listen to such lectures as this of Hallery's without remembering all the time that it's a particular human being with a white face and a lisp.... And perhaps {{they will be able to}} respect literature and fine thought for the sake of the general human mind for which they live and for the sake of their own receptiveness...." ...|$|E

5000|$|Swindon {{council is}} {{planning}} to install equipment on some of their traffic light systems {{so that they will}} turn to red early if a car is detected travelling above a preset speed on the approach. A Swindon councillor is reported to have said that [...] "the whole key is to monitor driver behaviour without beating them over the head" [...] and that [...] "it may annoy them, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> eventually <b>people</b> <b>will</b> work out that if they maintain a constant speed at or around the speed limit then actually their journey times will be much shorter because they won't be getting delayed by traffic lights". The RAC Foundation gave a cautious welcome to the trial. Similar systems are already in use in Spain and Portugal.|$|R
5000|$|Although Clinton was the 25th {{woman to}} run for U.S. president, {{she was the first}} female {{candidate}} to have held a highly probable chance of winning the nomination of a major party, and the presidential election.

As such, remarks surrounding her gender and appearance came to the fore.In March 2006, actress Sharon Stone expressed her doubt about Clinton's presidential chances, saying [...] "Hillary still has sexual power, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> accept that.

5000|$|I had {{a choice}} of {{cancelling}} the 1974tour … or going out and singing hoarse. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> give others more credit than they do, so I assumed they'd know I'm in bad voice but still feel the music's plentiful and good. I wrote that song about being stuck on a limb, and being down, but not out. - George Harrison, 1987 Like the Beatles track, [...] "This Guitar" [...] is structured around short, minor-key verses (in this case, in the key of G minor) that conclude with the song title, rather than distinct choruses. Author Ian Inglis also notes the [...] "evident similarity" [...] between the melody of the two compositions. As with Harrison's lyrics for [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", Inglis writes, [...] "This Guitar" [...] follows in a tradition established by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Bo Diddley, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument.|$|R

500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it just makes me so happy to see him and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> other <b>people</b> <b>will</b> feel the same way."

5000|$|The {{first line}} of the song {{contains}} the lyrics [...] "I cant say that I love Jesus", attracting some controversy. Peter Buck clarified the matter to Q magazines Tom Doyle in 1996: [...] "Its written {{from the perspective of}} a character that Michael saw on TV on a talk show. But are <b>people</b> going to <b>think</b> Michaels talking about himself not liking Jesus? <b>I</b> dont <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> take us that seriously.

5000|$|Due to Josh's {{conversion}} to Christianity and past stance on particular [...] "non-christian" [...] themes in {{a select few}} pre-1999 songs, many fans wondered what sort of setlist would be played at the Popes reunion show. In a Q and A on the band's website, Josh responded to such questions saying, [...] "No. There are only a couple songs that we wouldn't consider playing, and those are songs we didn't used to play very often anyway, so no one will miss them. We've been practicing {{through most of the}} old Popes catalog, trying to pick the songs that are the strongest. And we don't yet know what the final song selection will be, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be disappointed. All the real favorites should be there."
