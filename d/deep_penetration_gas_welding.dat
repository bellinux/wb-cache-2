40|$|Abstruct- This {{application}} paper {{addresses the}} control of a nonminimum-phase plant with variable large orders and de-lays. The process concerned is full <b>penetration</b> <b>gas</b> tungsten arc <b>welding.</b> Based on an analysis of accepted adaptive algorithms, the generalized predictive control algorithm presented by Clarke et al. is selected as the principal control strategy. An adaptive generalized predictive decoupling control scheme is constructed. To decouple our nonminimum-phase multivariable plant, a pre-dictive decoupling algorithm is also proposed. Simulations are performed to determine the default parameters of the algorithms. The performance has been tested by both simulations and exper-iments. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend a}} model for gravity {{segregation}} in steady-state gas/water injection into homogeneous reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). A new equation relates the distance gas and water flow together directly to injection pressure, independent of fluid mobilities or injection rate. We consider three additional cases: coinjection of gas and water over {{only a portion of}} the formation interval, injection of water above gas over the entire formation interval, and injection of water and gas in separate zones well separated from each other. If gas and water are injected at fixed total volumetric rates, the horizontal distance to the point of complete segregation is the same, whether gas and water are coinjected over all or any portion of the formation interval. At fixed injection pressure, the <b>deepest</b> <b>penetration</b> of mixed <b>gas</b> and water flow is expected when fluids are injected along the entire formation interval. At fixed total injection rate, injection of water above <b>gas</b> gives <b>deeper</b> <b>penetration</b> before complete segregation than does coinjection, but again exactly where the two fluids are injected does not affect the distance to the point of segregation. At fixed injection pressure, injection of water above gas is predicted to give <b>deeper</b> <b>penetration</b> before complete segregation. When injection pressure is limited, the best strategy for simultaneous injection of both phases from a vertical well would be to inject gas {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir and water over the rest of the reservoir height, with the ratio of the injection intervals adjusted to maximize overall injectivity. The 2 D model applies equally to gas/water flow and to foam, and to injection of water above gas from separate intervals of a vertical well or from two parallel horizontal wells, as long as injection is uniform along each horizontal well. Sample computer simulations for foam injection agree well with the model predictions if numerical dispersion is controlled...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to measure the welding {{residual}} stress distributions in a 70 mm-thick butt weld by one-pass electron <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> using both the inherent strain method and neutron diffraction method, respectively.

The longitudinal residual stress in the multi-pass flux-cored arc welding is tensile through all thicknesses in the welding fusion zone. Meanwhile, longitudinal residual stress in electron <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> is tensile on both surfaces and compressive at {{the inside of the}} plate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research related to the impact of electric arc activation onto drive welding energy and metal weld heating speed. It is con-firmed that activated tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> and activated metal inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> methods, depending on metal thickness, single pass weldability and chemical composition of activating flux, enable the reduction of welding energy by 2 - 6 times when compared to conventional welding methods. Additionally, the-se procedures create conditions to increase metal weld heating speed up to 1, 500 - 5, 500 °Cs – 1. Steel which can be rapidly heated, allows for a hardened structure to form (with carbon content up to 0. 4 %), together with a released mar-tensitic structure or a mixture of bainitic-martensitic structures. Results of the re-search of effectiveness of activated tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> and activated met-al inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> showed that increase in the penetration capability of electric arc, which increases welding productivity, is the visible side of activated tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> and activated metal inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> capabilities.

40|$|Despite {{its high}} efficiency, {{autogenous}} keyhole welding is not well-accepted for duplex stainless steels because it causes excessive ferrite in as-welded duplex microstructure, {{which leads to}} a degradation in toughness and corrosion properties of the material. Combining the <b>deep</b> <b>penetration</b> characteristics of plasma arc welding in keyhole mode and metal deposition capability of <b>gas</b> metal arc <b>welding,</b> hybrid plasma - <b>gas</b> metal arc <b>welding</b> process has considered for providing a proper duplex microstructure without compromising the welding efficiency. 11. 1 mm-thick standard duplex stainless steel plates were joined in a single-pass using this novel technique. Same plates were also subjected to conventional gas metal arc and plasma arc welding processes, providing benchmarks for the investigation of the weldability of the material. In the first place, the hybrid welding process enabled us to achieve less heat input compared to <b>gas</b> metal arc <b>welding.</b> Consequently, the precipitation of secondary phases, which are known to be detrimental to the toughness and corrosion resistance of duplex stainless steels, was significantly suppressed in both fusion and heat affected zones.
