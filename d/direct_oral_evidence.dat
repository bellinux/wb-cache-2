40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> {{anticoagulants}} including apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, {{which are}} approved for several therapeutic indications, can simplify perioperative and postoperative management of anticoagulation.

Given the extensive use of regional anesthesia in surgery and {{the increasing number of}} patients receiving <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> anticoagulants, it is crucial to understand the current clinical data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in this setting, particularly for anesthesiologists. We discuss current data, guideline recommendations, and best practice advice on effective management of the <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> anticoagulants and regional anesthesia, including in specific clinical situations, such as patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery at high risk of a thromboembolic event, or patients with renal impairment at an increased risk of bleeding...|$|R

40|$|Essentials: Despite trial data, {{guidelines}} {{have not}} endorsed <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> Xa inhibitors above other options. We provide profiles of venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk for 12 options. <b>Direct</b> <b>oral</b> Xa inhibitors had a favorable profile compared with low-molecular-weight heparin. Other options {{did not have}} favorable profiles compared with low-molecular-weight heparin. SUMMARY: Background There are numerous trials and several meta-analyses comparing venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis options after total hip and knee replacement (THR and TKR). None have included simultaneous comparison of new with older options. Objective: To measure simultaneously the relative risk of VTE and hemorrhage for 12 prophylaxis options. Methods: We abstracted VTE and hemorrhage information from randomized controlled trials published between January 1990 and June 2016 comparing 12 prophylaxis options. We then constructed networks to compute the relative risk for each option, relative to once-daily dosing with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Low. Results Main: Relative to LMWH Low, <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> Xa inhibitors had the lowest risk of total deep vein thrombosis (DVT) -asymptomatic and symptomatic- (odds ratio [OR], 0. 45; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 35 - 0. 57), translating to 53 - 139 fewer DVTs per 1000 patients. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) titrated to International Normalized Ratio [INR] 2 - 3 predicted 56 % more DVT events (OR, 1. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 14 - 2. 14). Aspirin performed similarly (OR, 0. 80; 95 % CI, 0. 34 - 1. 86), although small numbers prohibit firm conclusions. <b>Direct</b> <b>oral</b> Xa inhibitors {{did not lead to}} significantly more bleeding (OR, 1. 21; 95 % CI, 0. 79 - 1. 90). Secondary: Relative to LMWH Low, <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> Xa inhibitors prevented 4 -fold more symptomatic DVTs (OR, 0. 25; 95 % CI, 0. 13 - 0. 47). Conclusion: Relative to LMWH Low, <b>direct</b> <b>oral</b> Xa inhibitors had a more favorable profile of VTE and hemorrhage risk, whereas VKAs had a less favorable profile. The profile of other agents was not more or less favorable. Clinicians should consider these profiles when selecting prophylaxis options...|$|R
