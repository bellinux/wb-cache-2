5|$|Aigusta {{was baptized}} as Anastasia {{in order to}} marry Simeon of Russia in 1333; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341. There is no direct {{evidence}} {{that she was a}} daughter of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded that {{she was a member of}} Gediminas' family. The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, just two years after the marriage. Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of Kashin, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother Jaunutis sought her <b>help</b> <b>when</b> he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.|$|E

5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request <b>help</b> <b>when,</b> as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Castiel gets {{a job at}} a {{gas station}} and {{attempts}} to adjust to his new life as a human. He helps Dean hunt a rogue angel that is killing people in emotional pain, but later prays for <b>help</b> <b>when</b> Dean sends him away for the second time on Ezekiel's orders. Castiel is found by the neutral angel Muriel who heard his prayer. Muriel agrees to provide information but the two are captured by angels that have been trailing Muriel. Castiel and Muriel are taken to the anarchist angel Malachi, the leader of one side of the angel civil war (the other side being headed by the angel Bartholomew), and tortured for information on Metatron. Muriel is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rule}} of Mithridates II, Gotarzes I ruled Babylonia, while Orodes I (r. c.90–80BC) ruled Parthia separately. This system of split monarchy {{weakened}} Parthia, allowing Tigranes II of Armenia to annex Parthian territory in western Mesopotamia. This land would not be restored to Parthia until the reign of Sanatruces of Parthia (r. c.78–71BC). Following {{the outbreak of the}} Third Mithridatic War, Mithridates VI of Pontus (r.119–63BC), an ally of Tigranes II of Armenia, requested aid from Parthia against Rome, but Sanatruces refused <b>help.</b> <b>When</b> the Roman commander Lucullus marched against the Armenian capital Tigranocerta in 69BC, Mithridates VI and Tigranes II requested the aid of Phraates III of Parthia (r. c.71–58). Phraates did not send aid either, and after the fall of Tigranocerta he reaffirmed with Lucullus the Euphrates as the boundary between Parthia and Rome.|$|E

5|$|James had a {{controversial}} religious policy; {{his attempt to}} grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received. Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view {{in a letter to}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf. She was further dismayed when James refused to <b>help</b> <b>when</b> the Catholic King of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William was having an affair with Elizabeth Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to <b>help</b> <b>when</b> symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E

Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) asks for Paul's <b>help</b> <b>when</b> Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko) starts blackmailing him. Paul hires Marty Kranic (Darius Perkins) to take care of Robbo, who is later hit by a car. Paul pays Marty off for services rendered. Jack Lassiter (Alan Hopgood) returns to Erinsborough and warns Paul about putting business before family. Jack confesses to Paul that he is giving his fortune away because he is dying.

5|$|Sisler {{returned}} to the Tigers for the 1960season, and manager Dykes noted {{that he was not}} confident that his bullpen could <b>help</b> <b>when</b> needed, pointing to the previous season as a reference. The Tigers bullpen had won just nine games in 1959, but began 1960 with three straight victories, with Sisler pitching a scoreless two-inning appearance on April22. His performance was considered a surprise, due to having a poor spring training. Although he pitched well in his first game of the season, he quickly lost his form, and by May18, his ERA had risen to 5.06 and had a 1–2record. It was {{at this point in the}} season that he began to turn his fortunes around and regained his effectiveness, and by August12 he had lowered his ERA to 1.90. His season totals included a 2.47ERA and a 7-5win-loss record, both career bests, and added six saves in 80innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon is {{due for a}} root canal.

She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, {{but all of them}} have Valentine's Day plans and cannot <b>help.</b> <b>When</b> Liz calls the dentist's office to say she does not have anyone to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire <b>help.</b> <b>When</b> he asked her for her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E

After Rebecca admits to pushing Paul, Kate confesses to giving her a false alibi. Mark breaks up with her, but he becomes jealous when it appears she is moving on with Kyle Canning. Mark briefly moves in with Toadfish Rebecchi, when his home has to be fumigated, and becomes a role model to his son, Callum (Morgan Baker).

Some of Mark's colleagues turn against him. He has a one-night stand with Jade Mitchell and Kate struggles to forgive him. Mark is targeted with small acts of revenge for arresting Holland.

Shortly afterwards Toadie overhears a conversation at the police station and learns Mark has been killed. He is forbidden from telling anyone, but ultimately convinces the superintendent to tell Kate, who is heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} {{by all of}} his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him how}} he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo You Love Her Coz She's Dead are playing, announcing that Emily is already inside.
