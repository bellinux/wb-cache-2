5|$|Caragiale {{returned}} to Bucharest: in summer 1912, {{with help from}} journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky, the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette, L'Indépendence Roumaine, informing his readers that he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania. In October, he became {{the chief of staff}} in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca's political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as a means for his own advancement ("From now on I'll have political lode , something certain, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> certainty on Earth.") Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu's executive.|$|E

The Loughgall RUC station was attacked again on 5 September 1990, when a van bomb caused widespread damage and wounded seven constables.|$|E

Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; {{one of the first}} breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; [...] "Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge. But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> one!) has not been forthcoming.

GameSpy's Bill Hiles said that the game [...] "preceded the 'tactical squad-based, first-person shooter' action genre by a full two years", and that [...] "In 1996,...Terra Nova didn't feel like any other game out there". Hiles called Tribes 2 [...] "a spiritual descendent of Terra Nova <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> one". Project leader Dan Schmidt later said that he had [...] "a bit of a {{negative}} experience overall because the thing dragged on forever", but he noted that [...] "there are people who regard it highly so it can't have been that terrible".

500|$|... "Everytime" [...] {{was also}} used in the 2013 American film Spring Breakers, {{directed}} by Harmony Korine. The scene begins with the characters of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brittany (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) standing in the backyard {{of the character of}} Alien (James Franco), who sits at a white grand piano. The girls are wearing My Little Pony ski masks, sparkly pink tiger bathing suits, sweatpants with [...] "DTF" [...] on the rear and shotguns in their hands.

[...] José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, quoted the song's lyrics at a 2005 press conference after enlisting Bono {{in an effort to get}} governments in the European Union to give more money to developing countries, [...] and stated that the lyrics inspired an article he wrote about the future of Europe.

Another voice from academia to speak unfavorably of the opposition met by Șăineanu was Alexandru Philippide, who wrote: [...] "I am not philosemitic, but <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> a kike deserving of naturalization, that would be Șăineanu." [...] Shortly after this incident, the new National Liberal Minister Spiru Haret reshuffled the teaching posts, and Șăineanu, who was holding a new teacher's position at Bucharest's Școala Normală Superioară, found himself unemployed, and opted to seek employment outside Romania, in Paris and Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Linnaeus, who was {{familiar}} with Plumier's Genera, adopted the genus name Magnolia in 1735 in his first edition of Systema Naturae, without a description, but with a reference to Plumier's work. In 1753, he took up Plumier's Magnolia in {{the first edition of}} Species Plantarum. There he described a monotypic genus, with the sole species being Magnolia virginiana. Since Linnaeus never saw a herbarium specimen (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> one) of Plumier's Magnolia and had only his description and a rather poor picture at hand, he must have taken it for the same plant which was described by Catesby in his 1730 Natural History of Carolina. [...] He placed it in the synonymy of Magnolia virginiana var. fœtida, the taxon now known as Magnolia grandiflora. Under Magnolia virginiana Linnaeus described five varieties (glauca, fœtida, grisea, tripetala, and acuminata). In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae (1759), he merged grisea with glauca, and raised the four remaining varieties to species status.|$|E

[...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable {{in light of what}} he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E
