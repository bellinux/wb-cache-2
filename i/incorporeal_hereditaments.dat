50|$|By {{keeping this}} {{distinction}} in mind, {{the right of}} patronage {{in the case of}} parochial benefices ("the advowson") appears logical, being in fact the right, which was originally vested in the donor of the temporalities, to present to his bishop a clerk to be admitted, if found fit by the bishop, to the office to which those temporalities are annexed. In other words, the gift of the glebe which can be called a rectory manor or church furlong was only ever granted subject to receiving an <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditament</b> (inheritable and transferable right) for the original donor.|$|R

[...] The Gaelic title, Lord (Tiarna/Baron) of Molahiffe (in legalese, an <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditament),</b> should not be {{confused}} with the Baronetcy of Molahiffe, which was an English title held by some of the Browne family (Earls of Kenmare) after they took possession of former MacCarthy lands at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

50|$|In England and Wales, {{the term}} is used in {{property}} taxation. A rateable hereditament is a property which fulfils the requirements to render it subject to a rating assessment. Assessments may apply to both corporeal and <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A franchise, {{such as a}} corporation, a jurisdiction, or a {{right to}} collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an [...] "incorporeal hereditament".

50|$|Scottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament, and {{although}} considered noble, their titles are <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments.</b> At one time feudal barons did sit in parliament. However, {{they are considered}} minor barons and not peers because their titles can be hereditary, or bought and sold.|$|E
50|$|A later, related, {{development}} was {{the granting of}} the first viscountcy in Ireland in 1478 to a Preston, Lord Gormanston, the Premier Viscount of Ireland, {{who at the time}} was a major landowner in the Fingal area, and a direct descendant of Walter de Lacy. That viscountcy was called after Gormanston as the latter was the principal seat and Manor of the Prestons at the time, having been acquired upon their relinquishment of occupancy of the Manor of Fyngallestoun. The Viscounts Gormanston continued to retain the Lordship of the latter under reversion., and the prescriptive barony of Fingal was also retained by the Viscount Gormanston as an <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditament</b> in gross, until passed to the late Patrick Denis O'Donnell.|$|R
50|$|Falconer was {{the eldest}} son of the Rev. Thomas Falconer, by Frances, only child of Lieutenant-colonel Robert Raitt. He was born at Corston, Somersetshire, on 27 December 1801, and was baptised there on 21 July 1802. On 10 December 1819 he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, and having taken a third class in {{classics}} and a first class in mathematics graduated B.A. in 1823, and proceeded M.A. in 1827. He was elected a Petrean fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, on 30 June in that year, and was mathematical examiner in the university in 1832-3, and again in 1836-8. In 1839 he opened the Petrean fellowships at Exeter College to natives of Cheshire by conveying a small <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditament</b> to Lord Petre for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Hereditaments {{are divided}} into {{corporeal}} and <b>incorporeal.</b> Corporeal <b>hereditaments</b> are [...] "such as affect the senses, and may be seen and handled by the body; incorporeal are not the subject of sensation, can neither be seen nor handled, are creatures of the mind, and exist only in contemplation". An example of a corporeal hereditament is land held in freehold.|$|R
50|$|Following {{a report}} by the Law Reform Commission, the system of feudal tenure as such, in so far as it had survived, was {{abolished}} by the Oireachtas in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act (no. 27 of 2009); fee tail was also abolished http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/. However, estates and interests in land, including <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> continue. Formerly registered or proven feudal titles with a solid root of title, and the submerged feudal titles of surviving Irish or British peers are not affected, and continue to exist as personal rights, now held in gross. However, the obsolete or unregistered feudal titles, and those that lapsed into desuetude after 1662, when the Irish Parliament passed the Abolition of Tenures Act, no longer exist as <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> nor as personal rights, and cannot be revived.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feudal system}} was finally {{completely}} abolished in the Republic of Ireland under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act (No. 27 of 2009) {{passed by the}} Oireachtas on 21 July 2009. [...] The Act accordingly abolished feudal tenure, but preserved estates in land, including customary rights and <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rich body {{of common}} law {{regarding}} advowsons can sometimes become relevant {{in modern times}} when dealing with disputes over modern <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> such as farming allotments, that are not handled by statute or adequately settled by other common law. This {{took place in the}} 1980 case of First Victoria National Bank v. United States.|$|E
50|$|In {{the history}} of English common law, a {{jurisdiction}} could be held {{as a form of}} property (or more precisely an <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditament)</b> called a franchise. Traditional franchise jurisdictions of various powers were held by municipal corporations, religious houses, guilds, early universities, Welsh Marches, and Counties Palatine. Types of franchise courts included Courts Baron, Courts Leet, merchant courts, and the Stannary Courts which dealt with disputes involving the tin miners of Cornwall. The original royal charters of the American colonies included broad grants of franchise jurisdiction along with other governmental powers to corporations or individuals, as did the charters for many other colonial companies such as the British East India Company and British South Africa Company. Analogous jurisdiction existed in medieval times on the European Continent. Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, franchise jurisdictions were largely eliminated. Several formerly important franchise courts were not officially abolished until Courts Act of 1971.|$|R
40|$|Under the English {{common law}} the officer 2 ̆ 7 s right or {{interest}} in the office which he held {{was regarded as a}} property right, an <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditament.</b> 1 Largely because of the inherent difference between the nature and incidents of the public office at common law and those of the public office in this country, this conception never gained general acceptance here. 2 In a few cases, 3 and particularly in the decisions of the courts of North Carolina, 4 offices have been asserted to be the property of the rightful incumbent. In these decisions the officer 2 ̆ 7 s right has been regarded as less absolute, perhaps, than that of BLACKSTONNE 2 ̆ 7 S conception, but these courts have insisted that it is none the less a property right. Nevertheless they have recognized the power of the legislature to abolish an office 5 and to decrease, 6 though perhaps not to abolish, 7 the compensation thereof during the term of the incumbent. They have further limited the officer 2 ̆ 7 s property in the office and its perquisites by recognizing his lack of power and authority to sell or assign the office or to delegate to another the performance of its duties. ...|$|R
25|$|Although {{the common}} law courts do not regard coats of arms as either {{property}} or as being defensible by action, armorial bearings are a form of property nevertheless, generally described as tesserae gentilitatis or insignia of gentility. Armorial bearings are <b>incorporeal</b> and impartible <b>hereditaments,</b> inalienable, and descendable {{according to the law}} of arms. Generally speaking (there have been very rare examples of patents in which the arms are granted to descend with some different limitation), this means they are inherited by the issue (male and female) in the male line of the grantee, though they can be inherited as quarterings by the sons of an heraldic heiress, where there is no surviving male heir, provided her issue also have a right to bear arms in their own male line.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments</b> are {{hereditary}} {{titles of}} honour or dignity, heritable titles of office, coats of arms, prescriptive barony, rights of way, tithes, advowsons, pensions, annuities, rents, franchises, etc. The term is still {{used in the}} phrase [...] "lands, tenements and hereditaments" [...] to describe property in land, as distinguished from goods and chattels or movable property.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{the word}} [...] "grant" [...] was {{originally}} made use of, in treating of conveyances of interests in lands, to denote a transfer by deed {{of that which}} could not be passed by livery, and was applied only to <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> it became a generic term, applicable to the transfer of all classes of real property.|$|E
5000|$|Blackstone [...] {{observes that}} there are offices, {{consisting}} of a right to exercise a public or private employment, along with the fees and emoluments thereunto belonging, that are also <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> i.e., heritable. Examples include certain royal offices, such as the Lord High Steward of Ireland. The holder may have an estate in them, unto him and his heirs. Other offices may be for life or for a term of years.

50|$|Every {{seignory}} now existing {{must have}} been created before the statute Quia Emptores (1290), which forbade the future creation of estates in fee-simple by subinfeudation. The only seignories of any importance at present are the lordships of manors. They are regarded as <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> and are either appendant or in gross. A seignory appendant passes with the grant of the manor; a seignory in gross—that is, a seignory which has been severed from the demesne lands of the manor to which it was originally appendant—must be specially conveyed by deed of grant.|$|E
50|$|Legally, advowsons {{were treated}} as real {{property}} that could be held or conveyed, and conversely could be taken or encumbered, in the same general manner as a parcel of land. Advowsons {{were one of the}} earliest <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> and often held in fee tail. Litigation on the basis of an advowson was somewhat specialized, with unique forms of action inapplicable to other realty, such as the writ of quare impedit, by which a patron sued a bishop in support of his presented candidate being unreasonably hindered from succeeding to a benefice.|$|E
5000|$|The High Court of Australia {{has taken}} a wide view {{of the concept of}} [...] "property".

Justice Starke said the term includes: [...] "every species of valuable right and interest including real and personal property, <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments</b> such as rents and services, rights-of-way, rights of profit or use in land of another, and choses in action. Justice McTiernan confirmed the term property extends to tangible and intangible property.|$|E
5000|$|Article 40.2.2° of the Constitution states [...] "No {{title of}} nobility or of honour may be {{accepted}} by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government."

50|$|In {{the reign}} of Victoria there was a vast mass of {{legislation}} dealing with real estate in almost every conceivable aspect. At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the Wills Act 1837. The transfer of real estate was simplified by the Real Property Act of 1845 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882. Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given by the Settled Estates Act 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act 1877, and the Settled Land Act 1882. Succession duty was levied {{for the first time}} on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of the Mortmain Act was relaxed in favour of gifts and sales to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks and museums. The period of limitation was shortened for most purposes from twenty to twelve years by the Real Property Limitation Act 1874. Several acts were passed dealing with the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the preservation of commons and open spaces. The Naturalization Act 1870 enabled aliens to hold and transfer land in England. The Felony Act 1870, abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883 and 1900, and other acts, gave the tenant of a tenancy within the acts a general right to compensation for improvements, substituted a year's notice to quit for the six months' notice previously necessary, enlarged the tenant's right to fixtures, and limited the amount of distress. By the Intestate Estates Act 1884 the law of escheat was extended to <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments</b> and equitable estates. Among other subjects which have been dealt with by legislation in the 19th century may be mentioned land transfer, registration, mortgage, partition, excambion, fixtures, taking of land in execution, declaration of title and apportionment.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{main feature}} of the English law of real {{property}} is that [...] "real" [...] property (or [...] "realty") means land, {{and the things that}} goes with it, alone. This is classified as different from movables or other types of [...] "personal" [...] property (or [...] "personalty"). The distinction matters mainly to define the scope of the subject matter, because there are different registration requirements, taxes, and other regulations for land's use. The technical definition of [...] "land" [...] encompasses slightly more than in the word's common use. Under the Law of Property Act 1925, section 205(1)(ix) says land means [...] "land of any tenure, mines and minerals, whether or not held apart from the surface, buildings or parts of buildings (whether the division is horizontal, vertical or made in any other way) and other hereditaments; also a manor, advowson, and a rent and other <b>incorporeal</b> <b>hereditaments,</b> and an easement, right, privilege or benefit in, over, or derived from land..." [...] This cumbersome definition indicates two general ideas. First, land includes physical things attached to it (e.g. buildings and [...] "hereditaments") and, second, intangible rights (like an easement, a right of way). Perhaps in aspiration of appearing scientific, lawyers have become accustomed to describing property in land as being [...] "four dimensional". The two dimensional area of land surface, bounded by a fence, is complemented by rights over all buildings and [...] "fixtures". This becomes most relevant in disputes after a contract to sell land, when a buyer alleges a thing was included in a sale, but a contract was silent on the specifics. In Holland v Hodgson Blackburn J held that looms installed in a factory formed part of the land. Objects resting on the ground and [...] "attached" [...] only by gravity will not normally be part of the land, although {{it could be that the}} parties [...] "intended" [...] something different, or rather what the parties' reasonable expectations were. Easily removable things, like carpets and curtains, or houseboats, will not be land, but less easily removed things, like taps and plugs are. In the third dimension, as section 205(1)(ix) points out, mines and sub-surface things, belong to the surface owner, and up to a general limit of 500 feet, the landowner will have a right to the atmosphere above his land as well. Public policy sets the limit in both cases, so since the 16th century Case of Mines the Crown has a claim to valuable minerals or natural resources that are discovered, as well as valuable treasure. And in the other direction, aircraft or satellites that are sufficiently high are not considered to trespass, or infringe an owner's right to peaceful enjoyment. The fourth dimension of land to an English property lawyer, is time. Since 1925 English law recognises two [...] "estates" [...] in land, or kinds of ownership interest: the [...] "fee simple", which is a right to use for an unlimited time, and a [...] "lease", which is an interest for a fixed period of time. In all situations, however, use of the land is constrained by agreements or binding rights with neighbours, and the requirements of the local council and government.|$|E
