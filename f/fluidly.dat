5|$|Animaniacs {{was made}} with a higher {{production}} value than standard television animation; the show had a higher cel count than most TV cartoons. The Animaniacs characters often move <b>fluidly,</b> and do not regularly stand still and speak, as in other television cartoons.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text <b>fluidly,</b> in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more <b>fluidly.</b> A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted <b>fluidly,</b> forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations {{are limited to}} Africa and Asia. Wild equine social systems come in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very <b>fluidly.</b> In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E
5|$|Cotto {{returned}} to action on February 21, 2009, in a card {{held at the}} Madison Square Garden, sporting {{the first of his}} trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent's style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more <b>fluidly,</b> connecting with jabs and hooks. One round later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, who was able to continue until the recess. In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team's staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team's nutritionist as his new trainer.|$|E
25|$|The band {{released}} its second album, The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek, in 2001. Though {{there were still}} plenty of pop-culture references on this album, it contained many more softer songs and slightly lighter guitars. The band would continue chords through tracks in order to <b>fluidly</b> transition in between songs, a trend that continued on the group's later albums.|$|E
25|$|Androids are {{a staple}} of science fiction. Isaac Asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of {{robotics}} and artificial intelligence, notably in his 1950s series I, Robot. One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved. Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving, thinking and speaking as <b>fluidly</b> as them.|$|E
25|$|February Shadows can be {{categorized}} as a psychological novel. The entire narration is told through first person stream of consciousness, and the plot builds through the unearthing of new memories as they emerge in Hilde's mind. The story is told in a mix {{of past and present}} and the narration switches <b>fluidly</b> {{back and forth between the}} two. The manner of the flashbacks and the inner comments Hilde makes about each informs the reader that she wishes to repress the horrific memories of 2 February 1945. Hilde constantly reminds herself to forget the past as if her survival and sanity depended on doing so.|$|E
25|$|Christie's {{experiments}} with first-person narration, especially in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, saw her attempt {{to expand the}} formal resources of the detective novel. In And Then There Were None (1939), her most successful novel in which none of her detectives appear, her third-person narrative moves <b>fluidly</b> among the perspectives of all of her characters. This need to see different events from alternative perspectives (especially her suspects') indicates that Christie increasingly favoured third-person narration {{over the course of}} her career. In Sad Cypress, for example, the character of a woman on trial is made to think like a murderer when the narrative is written from her perspective: a significant red herring that is only possible due to the narrative method.|$|E
25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into subareas that scrolled either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory management controller chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a landing sequence, and a Breakout clone. One of the first raster-based platform games to scroll <b>fluidly</b> in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} qualities. Paul Glancey of Computer and Video Games lauded the game's opening sequence, {{and called the}} sprites among [...] "the best designed and most <b>fluidly</b> animated" [...] in an Amiga game. The Games Machine found the graphics [...] "utterly impressive", and Barrett of ST/Amiga Format wrote that the game is [...] "in a class of its own", praising the sprite animations. Zzap!64s Hogg commended the animation and backgrounds. Conversely, CU Amigas Pattenden felt that the graphics lack depth.|$|E
500|$|Research has {{suggested}} that cognitive flexibility is related to other cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. Fluid intelligence, described {{as the ability to}} solve problems in new situations, enables fluid reasoning ability. [...] When one is able to reason <b>fluidly,</b> they are in turn more likely to be cognitively flexible. Furthermore, those who are able to be cognitively flexible have been shown {{to have the ability to}} switch between and/or simultaneously think about sounds and meanings, which increases their reading fluency and comprehension. Cognitive flexibility has also been shown to be related to one’s ability to cope in particular situations. For example, when individuals are better able to shift their thinking from situation to situation they will focus less on stressors within these situations.|$|E
500|$|The retiarius wore minimal armour; {{unlike other}} gladiator types, he wore no helmet, greaves, or shield. He wore a manica {{on his left}} arm, where other gladiators wore it on the right; this allowed him to more <b>fluidly</b> make a {{right-handed}} cast of his net. Attached {{to the top of}} this was a long bronze or leather guard over the upper left arm and shoulder, known as a galerus. This guard extended [...] beyond the shoulder blade and flared outward, allowing free movement of the gladiator's head. The device protected the upper arm, head and face when the retiarius kept his left side to his opponent. The armour was designed to let the net-man duck his head behind it, and it was curved so as to deflect a blow from the top downwards, not up towards the eyes. Three examples of this protective gear found at Pompeii vary between [...] in length and about the same in width. They weigh about [...]|$|E
500|$|Li criticized Capcom for not {{providing}} an easy alternative to unlock characters since the multiple Arcade mode playthroughs needed to unlock {{them could be}} frustrating. Nintendo World Report's Neal Ronaghan mentioned it can get tedious, and echoing Li's sentiment, Ryan Scott of GameSpy complained that [...] "arcade mode needs {{to be left to}} die," [...] as multiplayer is the primary reason for playing fighting games. Both Scott and Ramsay thought many of the other unlockables obtainable through Arcade mode didn't offer sufficient value. Reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component; GameDaily's Robert Workman reported that it ran <b>fluidly,</b> but Scott said that the game lagged often enough to be unplayable. Edwards thought [...] "the netcode hasn't shown itself to be particularly sturdy," [...] but the situation may improve as the number of local players increase. Both Bozon and GameTrailers said that performance depends on each player's connection; the latter explained that lag is more likely to occur when playing against a distant opponent.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Grand Unification (2006), Vik Bansal of MusicOMH wrote about their varied dynamics: [...] "Where others are happy to be one-dimensional, Fightstar are not content unless a song moves <b>fluidly</b> through {{seemingly}} incongruous but ultimately coherent moods and musical dynamics. The interspersion of thoroughly heavy metal sections within the otherwise widescreen rock of 'Grand Unification Pt I' and 'Sleep Well Tonight' encapsulates this perfectly". One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours showed the band expanding their sound and pushing further into both lighter and heavier territories, {{with a mixture of}} more melodic soundscapes and heavier metallic styles. According to Q magazine, [...] "The intricate instrumental passages, multi-tracked vocal harmonies and pounding riffs hint at Muse-scale ambition and intellect". The Sun described One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours sound as [...] "heavier, slicker and as focused as ever, tracks such as '99' and 'We Apologise For Nothing' embrace an epic, panoramic sound that sweeps you off your feet. It’s aggressive but emotive, with heaps of melody among the huge riffs." ...|$|E
500|$|Dre's {{handling}} of the production was praised by critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Erlewine stated: [...] "Dre realized that it wasn't time to push the limits of G-funk, and instead decided to deepen it musically, creating easy-rolling productions that have more layers than they appear". He added that the beats were [...] "laid-back funky, continuing to resonate after many listens". Rolling Stone writer Touré noted [...] "The Chronics slow, heavy beats were a sonic representation of angry depression as accurate as Cobain's feedback blasts; Doggystyle is leaner, with its high-tempo Isaac Hayes- and Curtis Mayfield-derived tracks". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "Most of Dre's hooks and nearly all his beats refuse to linger, as if the songs themselves are nervous, fearful of exposure, restless to get offscreen." [...] Entertainment Weekly magazine's David Browne mentioned that [...] "The mix of samples and live music on Dre's latest, The Chronic, gave it texture and depth, and he continues his knob-turning growth on Doggystyle, <b>fluidly</b> weaving together a gaggle of background singers and rappers, quirky samples, his trademark horror-flick keyboard lines". The Source magazine columinst wrote: [...] "Dre's brand of G-funk may be common now, but it is still painstakingly well-produced".|$|E
500|$|Gold {{features}} arcade, team, and tournament gameplay modes. The game's new [...] "practice mode" [...] lets players rehearse {{their skills}} and follow tutorials. In the new knockout tournament mode, players cycle through a preselected team of characters when their current character is eliminated. Gold features the same characters, combos, and environments available in the arcade Killer Instinct2. Players can unlock new character appearances, gameplay difficulty levels, and an additional playable character. Gold and Killer Instinct 2 shared roster contains ten characters in total: three new additions and seven returning from the previous title. Characters include a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatale. Fights are set in spaceship, jungle, and castle settings, among others, and some backgrounds are interactive. Gold features new camera functions that automatically zoom to better frame the fight. The release also includes enhancements to the 3D backgrounds and an upgraded soundtrack, but excludes the full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers from the arcade release due to the Nintendo64's cartridge media data storage restrictions. While Gold backgrounds are <b>fluidly</b> animated in 60 frames per second, its character animations have fewer frames than its arcade equivalent.|$|E
500|$|Ryses {{intention}} was to build a cinematic story. The team put emphasis on building the game's protagonist, Marius Titus, who {{was described as a}} character with three different sides. The game's cinematic director, Peter Gornstein, considered that adding personalities to characters {{as one of the most}} important features in creating a good story, as it allows players to care for and emphasize the character. He also hoped that the character is consistent throughout the game. As a result, the team developed transition sequences, in which gameplay can <b>fluidly</b> transit to cinematic. The game also put emphasis on the protagonist's motion capture. To achieve this, the team collaborated with The Imaginarium Studios to develop the cinematic and motion-capture technology for the game. According to Yerli, having good motion capture technology can help [...] "create the ultimate emotion". The game's camera was originally set to be controlled by artificial intelligence, drawing inspirations from Seven Samurai and Children of Men, but the idea was later scrapped and a dynamic camera was designed to replace it. The camera was also made closer to the playable character than other hack and slash games, as they hoped that they could show a [...] "claustrophobic brutality" [...] from it. According to Crytek, having a close up camera has always been the game's core element.|$|E
500|$|Corriea {{was mixed}} about the game's HD upgrade, stating {{that while the}} {{background}} were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and the main characters moved <b>fluidly</b> and expressed emotion properly, NPCs or characters unimportant to the stories did not receive the same attention as the main cast. Schilling was disappointed with the result, frequently citing scenery and character behavior that looked out of place on the big screen. Miller said that the game's visuals were [...] "dominated by muddy textures and frequent loading.", while he negatively noted {{the removal of the}} original's multiplayer. Damiani praised the upgrades for the main characters, but noted multiple inconsistencies in both the environments and cutscenes. Famitsu found the graphics [...] "dramatically beautiful", but found it strange seeing the original environments on a large screen. Meyerink said that, while not hard on the eyes, the upgrades were well below what he expected. Sullivan praised the lighting and shading effects, but shared Corriea's criticism of NPCs and noted low-quality environmental textures, saying she was [...] "so bored by most environments that [...] stopped caring about them halfway through the story." [...] The localized dialogue also received mixed to negative reactions, with multiple reviewers faulting the English voice actors' performances. Opinions on the PC port were mixed: Meyerink marked it as an improvement of the ports of the XIII games while acknowledging issues with the graphics and controls, while Roberts was not impressed by its performance.|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave Zooropa an [...] "A", {{calling it}} [...] "harried, spontaneous-sounding, and {{ultimately}} exhilarating album". Browne {{noted that it}} sounds [...] "messy" [...] and [...] "disconnected", but clarified [...] "that sense of incoherence is the point" [...] {{in the context of}} the record's technology themes. He concluded, [...] "For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it [...] "captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour" [...] so much so that [...] "it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour" [...] and yet sounds like a [...] "souvenir" [...] of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a [...] "creative stretch", noting that the band experiments more yet retains their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's [...] "yearning anthemic reach" [...] and [...] "obvious, slinky pop charm" [...] are replaced with [...] "darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a [...] "freewheeling feel of going with the flow" [...] throughout the album and calling it [...] "rootless and loose, restless and unsettled". For Du Noyer, U2 sounded [...] "monstrously tight as a performing unit and <b>fluidly</b> inventive as composers, so the results transcend the merely experimental".|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Nemo, with its ravishing underwater fantasia, manages to trump the design glamour of earlier Pixar films." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A, saying [...] "In this seamless blending of technical brilliance and storytelling verve, the Pixar team has made something as marvelously soulful and innately, <b>fluidly</b> American as jazz." [...] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "As eye-popping as Nemo's peepers and as eccentric as this little fish with asymmetrical fins." [...] David Germain of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from Toy Story onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation." [...] The 3D re-release prompted a retrospective on the film nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger described it as [...] "a genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic." [...] On the 3D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by [...] "the dimensionality of the oceanic deep" [...] where [...] "the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3D explorers were born to boldly go".|$|E
500|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 51 reviews. In The Independent, Simon Price called it Vampire Weekend's [...] "most cohesive and convincing effort yet" [...] featuring their most accessible compositions, while Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork said the singing suited the music <b>fluidly</b> on songs that sounded more natural and dynamic than the band's previous work. Alexis Petridis, lead critic for The Guardian, believed Vampire Weekend successfully avoided the gimmicky sounds of their previous albums and wrote more genuine lyrics dealing with mortality rather than [...] "arch depictions of moneyed young Wasp lives". Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo said the songs may sound dense and wordy, but they would be [...] "immediately potent on a purely visceral level" [...] for listeners, [...] "striking a perfect balance that makes for what's perhaps the best album of the year". Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone said the album featured a particular spirit and songcraft evocative of urban life, while Robert Christgau appreciated how many twists the coming of age themes revealed. In his review for MSN Music, Christgau found the record similar to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) because of how each lyric and musical element was [...] "pleasurable in itself and aptly situated in the sturdy songs and tracks, so that the whole signifies {{without a hint of}} concept". Greg Kot was more critical in the Chicago Tribune, writing that the group occasionally blundered in an attempt at ingenuity with the songs [...] "Ya Hey" [...] and [...] "Finger Back" [...] while finding the album [...] "darker, slower and weirder" [...] than their previous records. NME journalist John Calvert believed Vampire Weekend had sacrificed [...] "the sonic smarts that made them" [...] on what was an otherwise [...] "gorgeous album".|$|E
2500|$|Jeff [...] "Joker" [...] Moreau, {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Mass Effect video game series voiced by Seth Green. Given that {{the series is}} set in the fictional future, he is able to take medications to help with his disease and is a pilot.

2500|$|Tiny Toon Adventures {{was made}} with a higher {{production}} value than standard television animation. It had a cel count {{that was more than}} double that of most television animation. The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more <b>fluidly.</b> Pierre DeCelles, an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as [...] "fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop".|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{fiercely}} {{independent and}} frontier {{nature of the}} former Oregon Country and now Western Part of the United States, are a desire of many Pacific Northwesterners to improve upon their form of Democracy by further subdividing the region into socio-political or bioregion defined nation states.

[...] Among these <b>fluidly</b> changing geographical boundaries and areas sought by a segment {{of the population of the}} Northwest are the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers were {{universal}} in {{praising the}} game's art style. 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey called it [...] "gorgeously, <b>fluidly</b> animated, in both its cut-scenes {{and within the}} actual gameplay." [...] Joystiq's Justin McElroy stated [...] "animations are so smooth between attacks that you scarcely get to enjoy snuffing out one human life before you're on to stabbing the next soon-to-be-ghost." [...] Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot agreed, adding [...] "colorful visuals and well-crafted cutscenes add {{a lot to the}} experience." [...] Mc Shea also praised the cooperative campaign, stating it was the best aspect of the game. Sharkey further praised the cooperative campaign for its inclusion of a separate story, complete with cutscenes.|$|E
2500|$|Noted in Joe Wood's article, [...] "The Yellow Negro", [...] "Japan in {{the eighties}} seemed a lot like America in the fifties." [...] In other words, the {{socio-economic}} conditions for white American middle-class children (white negroes) in the 1950s and their Japanese counterpart (Japanese blackfacers) in the 1980s allowed unprecedented cultural deviance to occur. It is the wealth and prosperity characteristic of these demographic groups at these specific points in time that can lend us understanding to when, why, and how one culture can most <b>fluidly</b> assimilate into another. Ironically, both cultures adopted black cultural practices {{in the midst of}} a post-war boom. In the case of Japan, the 'Japanese Miracle' gave many middle-class families the financial padding necessary for such diverse consumerism.|$|E
2500|$|Early work of Kerim Seiler is {{characterized}} by two-dimensional, life-size paintings of ordinary city objects, such as park benches and ticket machines. He diversified into larger works, such as colorful and inflatable molecule sculptures, a 250-meter-long permanent neon light installation at Zürich's central train station and his vaguely habitable brick structure Gulliver in Pfungen (2009). Appearing to maintain a classical view of harmony, Seiler has said that space and structure are key elements in his work. Elsewhere it is written, [...] "With the alphabet lettering paradigm in mind, Kerim Seiler has fashioned a non-alphabet system that revolves around a letter that cannot be deployed in words, its existence merely inferred by other letters. It may <b>fluidly</b> receive or reject ornament, be layered or cloaked, snap open and release, or serve as a crouching mechanism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tagore was a {{prolific}} composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit. His songs {{are known as}} rabindrasangit ("Tagore Song"), which merges <b>fluidly</b> into his literature, most of which—poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the thumri style of Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal colour of classical ragas to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ragas. Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not bhanga gaan, the body of tunes revamped with [...] "fresh value" [...] from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours [...] "external" [...] to Tagore's own ancestral culture.|$|E
2500|$|When a new ISU rule allowed {{professional}} skaters {{to regain}} their Olympic eligibility, the pair {{decided to return to}} amateur competition for the 1993–94 season and skate in the Olympics. In 1994, the couple won their second Olympic gold medal in Lillehammer, Oppland, Norway. Arguably the most influential, celebrated, and highly decorated pair team {{in the history of the}} sport, many consider them to be the greatest pair team ever to take the ice. They are often referred to simply as [...] "G". They were known for the quality of their basic skating technique: [...] "Grinkov and Gordeeva had something special that was more easily appreciated in person. They didn't make noise when they skated. They moved so <b>fluidly</b> that their blades whispered over the ice rather than scratching at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{received}} Tao Te Ching {{is a short}} text {{of around}} 5,000 Chinese characters in 81 brief chapters or sections (...) [...] There {{is some evidence that}} the chapter divisions were later additions—for commentary, or as aids to rote memorization—and that the original text was more <b>fluidly</b> organized. It has two parts, the Tao Ching (道經; chaps. 1–37) and the Te Ching (德經; chaps. 38–81), which may have been edited together into the received text, possibly reversed from an original [...] "Te Tao Ching." [...] The written style is laconic, has few grammatical particles, and encourages varied, even contradictory interpretations. [...] The ideas are singular; the style poetic. The rhetorical style combines two major strategies: short, declarative statements and intentional contradictions. The first of these strategies creates memorable phrases, while the second forces us to create our own reconciliations of the supposed contradictions.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the song}} is in simple triple metre ( [...] time), but the chorus is in [...] time. The song modulates between musical keys, using the key of A major for verses, B major for the pre-chorus, and G major for the chorus. It is sung by Lennon over an {{increasingly}} complicated underlying arrangement which features a tamboura, played by George Harrison, lead electric guitar put through a Leslie speaker, played by Harrison, and a counter melody on Lowrey organ played by McCartney and taped with a special organ stop sounding [...] "not unlike a celeste". Session tapes from the initial 1 March 1967 recording of this song reveal Lennon originally sang the line [...] "Cellophane flowers of yellow and green" [...] as a broken phrase, but McCartney suggested that he sing it more <b>fluidly</b> to improve the song.|$|E
2500|$|Sean Axmaker, {{writing in}} the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said the film {{presented}} a [...] "visionary odyssey with a grace and awe and visual scope that calls to mind Stanley Kubrick's [...] for a new millennium, with echoes of the industrial grunge and crew friction of Alien, the greenhouse ecology of Silent Running, even the unraveling sanity of Dark Star." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times referred to the special effects in the film as [...] "convincing and remorseless" [...] and that the film was at its strongest point when it [...] "focuses on the sheer enormity of the mission and its consequences". In Variety, Derek Elley wrote that the film was [...] "gripping enough with its solid performances, good-looking CGI, underlying tension and resonant, iron-hard digital soundtrack. This film reflects education excellence." [...] He reserved praise for the production merits, noting, [...] "Boyle generally directs <b>fluidly,</b> {{making the most of}} p.d. Mark Tildesley's sensible, not-too-futuristic sets, lensed with cool reserve by Alwin Kuchler." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coon's {{understanding}} of racial typology and diversity within the Indian sub-continent changed over time. In The Races of Europe, he regarded the so-called [...] "Veddoids" [...] of India ("tribal" [...] Indians, or [...] "Adivasi") as {{closely related to}} other peoples in the South-Pacific ("Australoids"), and he also believed that this supposed human lineage (the [...] "Australoids") was an important genetic substratum in Southern India. As for {{the north of the}} sub-continent, it was an extension of the Caucasoid range. By the time Coon coauthored The Living Races of Man, he thought that India's Adivasis were an ancient Caucasoid-Australoid mix who tended to be more Caucasoid than Australoid (with great variability), that the Dravidian peoples of Southern India were simply Caucasoid, and that the north of the sub-continent was also Caucasoid. In short, the Indian sub-continent (North and South) is [...] "the easternmost outpost of the Caucasoid racial region". Underlying all of this was Coon's typological view of human history and biological variation, a way of thinking that is not taken seriously today by most anthropologists/biologists. Like all world regions, it is now understood by most scientists that the Indian sub-continent bleeds genetically into neighboring regions, being structured <b>fluidly</b> and continuously in a loose pattern of isolation-by-distance. Nevertheless, Coon's views are of historical interest, and are part of a long line of western anthropology which has sought to describe and conceptualize biological diversity in the sub-continent.|$|E
2500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tanner Stransky {{started his}} review by {{pointing}} out the album's lead single [...] "Put It Down" [...] was actually the weakest song on Two Eleven. Stransky said [...] "It's one of the weakest offerings from an otherwise well-crafted for-the-fans album. Ignore what's pushed to pop radio. Brandy scores when her raspy-sweet voice soars during ballads and slow jams, and that's what stands out on this intimate, often ethereal collection." [...] He gave the album a B+ rating. Sarah Godfrey from Washington Post complimented the songs on the album and wrote that the album [...] "serves as a fine tribute , {{in part because it}} {{is a testament to the}} fact that, despite whatever trends are happening in popular music right now, a good voice always shines through." [...] Vibe noted that [...] "experimentation can spell struggle for some artists, but Two Eleven finds Brandy cruising <b>fluidly</b> past the predictable. Swinging from OVO-worthy emo-ethereal reflections to quirky up-tempos, the 18-year vet deviates from overdone slow-tempo production." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Gawker felt that Two Eleven [...] "doesn't sound any younger or older than Brandy is. It's not obtusely hip or desperately serious. It just is, it's just now and it's just right."
