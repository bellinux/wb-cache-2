40|$|The {{incidence}} of CHD is still increasing, which underscores {{the need for}} new preventive and therapeutic approaches to decrease CHD risk. In this respect, increasing apoA-I concentrations may be a promising approach, especially through increasing apoA-I synthesis. This review first provides insight into current knowledge on apoA-I production, clearance, and degradation, followed by a systematic review of dietary and novel <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> to target apoA-I metabolism. For this, a systematic search was performed to identify randomized controlled intervention studies that examined effects of whole foods and (non) nutrients on apoA-I metabolism. In addition, novel <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> were searched for, which were specifically developed to target apoA-I metabolism. We conclude that both dietary components and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> can be used to increase apoA-I concentrations or functionality. For the dietary components in particular, more knowledge about the underlying mechanisms is necessary, as increasing apoA-I per se does not necessarily translate into a reduced CHD risk...|$|R

40|$|Within our lakes, streams, estuaries, and oceans, {{there is}} an astounding chemodiversity of {{secondary}} metabolites produced by microbes, algae, and invertebrates. Nearly 30 years of study have yielded hundreds of examples in which secondary metabolites alter the foraging behavior or fitness of aquatic consumers, or both. However, {{our understanding of the}} mechanisms that mediate the fate and consequences of these metabolites in aquatic consumers remains in its infancy. Interactions between metabolites and consumers at the molecular and biochemical level are the purview of modern pharmacology, which is rooted in the long history of human–drug interactions and can be adopted for ecological studies. Here, we argue that a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approach</b> to consumer–prey interactions will be as productive within aquatic systems as it has been for understanding terrestrial systems. We review the diversity of secondary metabolites in aquatic organisms, their known effects on the feeding behaviors and performance of aquatic consumers, and the few studies that have attempted to describe their biochemical manipulation within consumer tissues, i. e., their absorption, distribution, metabolism (including detoxification), and excretion. We then highlight vexing issues in the ecology and evolution of aquatic consumer–prey interactions that would benefit from a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approach,</b> including specialist-versus-generalist feeding strategies, dietary mixing, nutrient–toxin interactions, and taste. Finally, we argue that a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approach</b> could help to predict how consumer–prey interactions are altered by global changes in pH, water temperature and ultraviolet radiation, or by pollution. Arguably, the state of knowledge of aquatic consumer–prey interactions is equivalent to that faced by ecologists studying terrestrial herbivores in the 1970 s; the literature documents profound variation among consumers in their feeding tolerances for secondary metabolites without a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that underlie that variation. The subsequent advancement in our understanding of terrestrial herbivores in the intervening decades provides confidence that applying a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approach</b> to aquatic consumers will prove equally productive...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{documented}} {{a link between}} psychological disorders and cardiac disease. Yet, no systematic {{attempts have been made}} to develop <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> for mood and anxiety disorders that could also be beneficial for cardiac health. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the regulation of stress, emotional behavior and cardiovascular function. General preclinical findings indicate that the endocannabinoid anandamide modulates physiological and behavioral stress responses and may also protect the heart from arrhythmias. Moreover, recent experimental studies suggest that pharmacological enhancement of anandamide signaling via inhibition of its degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) exerts anxiolytic- and antidepressive-like effects and improves cardiac autonomic function and the electrical stability of the myocardium in rodent models that reproduce aspects of human psychological/cardiac comorbidity. Here we summarize and discuss such experimental findings, which might guide future preclinical studies towards a systematic evaluation of the therapeutic potential of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> that target FAAH activity for the treatment of the comorbidity between psychological disorders and cardiac disease...|$|R
40|$|Affecting {{approximately}} 17, 000 {{new people}} each year, {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) is a devastating injury that leads to permanent paraplegia or tetraplegia. Current <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> are limited {{in their ability to}} ameliorate this injury pathophysiology, as many are not delivered locally, for a sustained duration, or at the correct injury time point. With this review, we aim to communicate the importance of combinatorial biomaterial and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> that target certain aspects of the dynamically changing pathophysiology of SCI. After reviewing the pathophysiology timeline, we present experimental biomaterial approaches to provide local sustained doses of drug. In this review, we present studies using a variety of biomaterials, including hydrogels, particles, and fibers/conduits for drug delivery. Subsequently, we discuss how each may be manipulated to optimize drug release during a specific time frame following SCI. Developing polymer biomaterials that can effectively release drug to target specific aspects of SCI pathophysiology will result in more efficacious approaches leading to better regeneration and recovery following SCI...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The obesity {{epidemic}} {{has been}} recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) {{as one of the}} top 10 global health problems. Worldwide, more than one billion adults are overweight and over 300 million are obese. The majority of developed countries, including the United States, Canada and England are experiencing dramatic increases in obesity. Obesity is a condition associated with the accumulation of excessive body fat resulting from chronic imbalance of energy whereby the intake of energy exceeds expenditure. The excess body fat predisposes an obese individual to chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and diseases of the gall bladder and cancer. The high incidence of obesity and the lack of safe pharmaceutical agents have fuelled an increase in anti-obesity drug-related research. Although a number of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> have been investigated in recent years, few safe, therapeutically effective products have been developed. This commentary focuses on emerging <b>pharmacological</b> <b>approaches</b> targeted for the treatment of obesity...|$|R
