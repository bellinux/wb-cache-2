However, there is no general agreement on the content and use of the term; it has been used differently and for different purposes in different historical and social contexts.

(A variation on an example in Nute 1975) We conclude, right then, that there is something strange about this farmer. We have a strong intuition that the counterfactual in (1) is false: if we had had good weather this summer, he would have had a good crop, but we know for a fact — and we assume that the farmer does too — that if the sun had grown cold, the pumpkins, much as everything else, would have been ruined. The problem that this paper deals with is that, under standard assumptions about the semantics of or, a minimal change semantics for counterfactuals (Stalnaker, 1968; Stalnaker and Thomason, 1970; Lewis, 1973) predicts (1) to be true, contrary to intuitions.

Aspects such as the development of competitive advantages and differentiation of companies within their competence are essential to get benefits. In particular, these advantages are required even in mature sectors.

Because it is a sector of particular importance in the province of Castellón. This sector develops 95 % of its activities in the area of Castellón. This agglomeration of the activities of the sector has given rise to many studies, and this project is attached to these studies, trying to weave the importance of innovation in a sector such as the ceramics.

40|$|This {{project began}} in 2013, with the award of an {{internal}} QUT Teaching and Learning grant. The task we wished to undertake was to document and better understand the role of studio teaching practice in the Creative Industries Faculty. While it was well understood that the Faculty had long used studio pedagogies as {{a key part of}} its teaching approach, organizational and other changes made it productive and timely to consider how the various study areas within the Faculty were approaching studio teaching. Chief among these changes were innovations in the use of technology in teaching, and at an organizational level the merging of what were once two schools within different faculties into a newly-structured Creative Industries Faculty. The new faculty consists of two schools, Media, Entertainment and Creative Art (MECA) and Design. We hoped to discover more about how studio techniques were developing alongside an ever-increasing number of options for content delivery, assessment, and interaction with students. And naturally we wanted to understand such developments across the broad range of nineteen study areas now part of the Creative Industries Faculty. This e-book represents the first part of our project, which in the main consisted in observing the teaching practices used in eight units across the Faculty, and then interviews with the unit coordinators involved. In choosing units, we opted for a broad opening definition of ‘studio’ to include not only traditional studios but also workshops and tutorials in which we could identify a component of studio teaching as enumerated by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council’s Studio Teaching Project: •	A culture, a creative community created by a group of students and studio teachers working together for periods of time •	A mode of teaching and learning where students and studio teachers interact in a creative and reflective process •	A program of projects and activities where content is structured to enable ‘learning in action’ •	A physical space or constructed environment in which the teaching and learning can take place (Source: [URL] The units we chose to observe, and which we hoped would represent something of the diversity of our study areas, were: •	Dance Project 1 •	Furniture Studies •	Wearable Architecture •	Fashion Design 4 •	Industrial Design 6 •	Advanced Writing Practice 3 •	Introduction to Creative Writing •	Studio Art Practice 2 Over the course of two semesters in 2013, we attended classes, presentations, and studio time in these units, and then conducted interviews that we felt would give further insight into both individual and discipline-specific approaches to studio pedagogies. We asked the same questions in each of the interviews: •	Could you describe the main focus and aims of your unit? •	How do you use studio time to achieve those aims? •	Can you <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of the kind of activities you use in your studio teaching? •	What does/do these example(s) achieve in terms of learning outcomes? •	What, if any, is the role of technology in your studio teaching practice? •	What do you consider distinctive about your approach to studio teaching, or the approach taken in your discipline area? The unit coordinators’ responses to these questions form some of the most interesting and valuable material in this book, and point to both consistencies in approach and teaching philosophies, as well as areas of difference. We believe that both can help to raise our critical awareness of studio teaching, and provide points of comparison for the future development of studio pedagogy in the Creative Industries. In each of the following pages, the interviews are placed alongside written descriptions of the units, their aims and outcomes, assessment models, and where possible photographs and video footage, as well as additional resources that may be useful to others engaged in studio teaching...|$|E

40|$|This paper surveys various results {{concerning}} stability for {{the dynamics}} of Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) systems on compact manifolds. The main, positive results state, roughly, that if the configuration manifold carries a hyperbolic metric, a metric of constant negative curvature, then {{the dynamics of}} the geodesic flow persists in the Euler-Lagrange flows of a large class of time-periodic Lagrangian systems. This class contains all time-periodic mechanical systems on such manifolds. Many of the results on Lagrangian systems also hold for twist maps on the cotangent bundle of hyperbolic manifolds. We also present a new stability result for autonomous Lagrangian systems on the two torus which shows, among other things, that there are minimizers of all rotation directions. However, in contrast to the previously known hedlund case of just a metric, the result allows the possibility of gaps in the speed spectrum of minimizers. Our negative result is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of <b>an</b> autonomous mechanical Lagrangian system on the two-torus in which this gap actually occurs.
