30|$|<b>Date</b> <b>seed</b> can be {{introduced}} as good candidate material to prepare high-quality biochar for heavy metal adsorption from aqueous solution {{because of its}} physicochemical properties. <b>Date</b> <b>seed</b> is a carbon-rich material with chemical compositions of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, and hydrocarbons. The lignin contents of the <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> are very high when {{compared to that of}} either softwoods or hardwoods (Nasser et al. 2016). Also, the hemicellulose contents of <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> were relatively like those reported by Bledzki et al. (2010) for typical hardwood materials such as coconut shell. The cellulose and hemicellulose have average per cent elemental compositions of 44.4 % carbon, 49.4 % oxygen, and 6.2 % hydrogen (Ahmad et al. 2012). Lignin has a three-dimensional polymer of phenylpropane units linked together by C–O–C or C–C bonds making its elemental composition to be higher in carbon (62 %) and lower in oxygen (32 %) (Jibril et al. 2008). The high contents of acids of the seeds such as oleic acid are between 41.1 and 58.8 % (Al-Shahib and Marshall 2003), which suggests that the seeds are rich with various surface functional groups such as alcohols, phenolic hydroxides, and ethers. Furthermore, <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> is characterized by its low ash content and high volatile matter and therefore, much surface area is generated due to loss of volatile organic matters during pyrolysis process. Hence, the conversion of <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> into high-quality biochar provides a new solution to the recycle and reuse of non-edible waste to produces valuable products (i.e. biochar) for environmental applications.|$|E

Methods: Two hundred rats were divided into 4 groups. Group I served as the control. Group II was given daily ingestions of 10 ml of <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> extract. Groups III and IV were made diabetic by streptozotocin injection and were given daily subcutaneous injections of 3 IU/day of insulin for 8 weeks.

Two biochars were prepared by slow pyrolysis of <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> for 3 h at 450 °C (DSB 450) and 550 °C (DSB 550). The adsorption of Ni 2 + was carried out by batch experiments at room temperature. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, contact time, initial metal concentration, and solution pH were investigated. The results showed that biochar prepared at higher temperature (DSB 550) had higher adsorption capacity of Ni 2 + from aqueous solution than biochar prepared at lower temperature (DBS 450). Adsorption efficiency of Ni 2 + ions was pH dependent and the maximum adsorption was found to occur at pH around 6. 0. To describe the equilibrium isotherms, the experimental results were analyzed by the Langmuir, and Freundlich isotherms. The adsorption isotherm for Ni 2 + by DSB 550 was best fit to Langmuir isotherm with (R 2 = 0. 94). The maximum adsorption capacity of Ni 2 + of DSB 550 biochar was 0. 609 mmol g− 1.

Decolonization of 85 – 97 % is recorded for the textile effluent and 75 – 90 % for the tannery effluent, in all cases decreasing with temperature increase. Good adsorption capacity of the prepared activated carbon in case of diluted textile and tannery effluent was found...|$|E
30|$|A control run of {{adsorption}} {{experiment was}} also {{carried out to}} investigate the effect of glassware and sampling instruments and showed that the quantity of Pb 2 + adhering on the container walls and other instruments were negligible (3.65 [*]±[*] 0.84 %). Adsorption performance of <b>date</b> <b>seed</b> biomass in their native form was also investigated and compared to the biochar. All experiments were repeated three times under the same conditions and average values were reported.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to investigate management practices for sweet sorghum as a bioenergy crop in Iowa and its storability as an ensiled product. A management {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of planting <b>date,</b> <b>seeding</b> rate, row width, and nitrogen fertility on the growth, biomass yield, and chemical composition of sweet sorghum. In addition, a silage study was conducted to determine chemical composition and fermentation potential of pressed sweet sorghum residue as well as the effects of enzymatic pretreatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{date palm}} (Phoenix dactylifera) seeds were {{utilized}} in some traditional medical remedies {{and have been}} investigated for their possible health benefits. This proposed study wanted to assess the effect of <b>date</b> palm <b>seeds</b> (DPS) dietary supplementation in comparison to mannan-oligosaccharides (Bio-Mos®) and β-glucan over antioxidant and immunity events that have effect on growth and carcass performances of broilers. An aggregate of 180, one-day-old, chicks were raised in the wire-floored cages and allotted into control, Bio-Mos (0. 1 %[*][*]Bio-Mos), β-glucan (0. 1 %[*][*]β-glucan), DPS 2 (2 % <b>date</b> crushed <b>seeds),</b> DPS 4 (4 % <b>date</b> crushed <b>seeds),</b> and DPS 6 (6 % <b>date</b> crushed <b>seeds)</b> groups. Broilers in DPS 2 and DPS 4 groups showed significant variations (P< 0. 05) in relative growth rate (RGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and efficiency of energy utilization in comparison to control group. Moreover, all DPS fed groups showed significant increases (P< 0. 05) in serum reduced glutathione (GSH) values. Meanwhile, both serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) levels were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) in DPS 2. Consequently, obtained data revealed a substantial enhancement of performance, immunity, and antioxidant status by DPS supplementation in broiler that {{might be related to}} the antioxidant and immune-stimulant constituents of P. dactylifera seeds...|$|R
25|$|Because {{pure line}} (genotypically identical) plant {{varieties}} often {{only have one}} or a few major genes for disease resistance, and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiline varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity <b>dates,</b> <b>seed</b> colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.|$|R
