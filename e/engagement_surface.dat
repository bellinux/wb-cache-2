5000|$|Colt's {{first two}} models {{produced}} after {{the acquisition of}} the rifle from ArmaLite were the 601 and 602, and these rifles were in many ways clones of the original ArmaLite rifle (in fact, these rifles were often found stamped Colt ArmaLite AR-15, Property of the U.S. Government caliber [...]223, with no reference to them being M16s). The 601 and 602 are easily identified by their flat lower receivers without raised surfaces around the magazine well and occasionally green or brown furniture. The 601 was adopted first {{of any of the}} rifles by the USAF, and was quickly supplemented with the XM16 (Colt Model 602) and later the M16 (Colt Model 604) as improvements were made. There was also a limited purchase of 602s, and a number of both of these rifles found their way to a number of Special Operations units then operating in South East Asia, most notably the U.S. Navy SEALs. The only major difference between the 601 and 602 is the switch from the original 1:14-inch rifling twist to the more common 1:12-inch twist. These weapons were equipped with a triangular charging handle and a bolt hold open device that lacked a raised lower <b>engagement</b> <b>surface.</b> The bolt hold open device had a slanted and serrated surface that had to be engaged with a bare thumb, index finger, or thumb nail {{because of the lack of}} this surface.|$|E

A couple of ladies realize Singer has a past with de Lessep's new boyfriend. During a trip in the The Berkshires at Medley's home, Frankel and de Lesseps get into a heated arguing {{with a lot of}} name-calling. Singer then accuses de Lesseps of breaking the girl code. De Lesseps reveals to all the ladies that she has found love with Tom, but more of Tom's history surfaces. During a confrontation between de Lesseps and Singer on Singer's history with Tom, Morgan reveals she has been have relations with Tom for the last decade. Despite everyone's opinions, de Lesseps reveals she is engaged to Tom and the ladies are left feeling conflicted bout the last-minute engagement party in Palm Beach during the Miami trip. During the trip Frankel meet a friend and reveals she has information that could jeopardize de Lesseps' relationship. Later in Miami, Singer's issues with the <b>engagement</b> <b>surface</b> while Morgan's realizes her feelings on Tom and his engagement to de Lesseps. Frankel meets up with the ladies as she determines the level of severity of her information. In the effort to determine whether to tell de Lesseps of her information, she shares it with Radziwill and Singer, who then shares it with Morgan. Frankel and Morgan continue to discuss it later that night and do some research which includes Frankel calling Tom. Frankel realizes she has no other choice but to tell de Lesseps that Tom has cheated. After hearing the news of Tom cheating and seeing the photos, de Lesseps is devastated and calls Tom to make sense of situation. Returning to New York, de Lesseps stay in a hotel to gather her thoughts. She later reveals at Frankel's Mexican themed party that she has forgiven Tom.|$|E

Surface learning strategies occur when the student’s per-ceived value of the course is low.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyComputing and Information SciencesScott A. DeLoachThe static {{nature of}} cyber systems gives attackers a {{valuable}} and asymmetric advantage - time. To eliminate this asymmetric advantage, a new approach, called Moving Target Defense (MTD) {{has emerged as}} a potential solution. MTD system seeks to proactively change system configurations to invalidate the knowledge learned by the attacker and force them to spend more effort locating and re-locating vulnerabilities. While it sounds promising, the approach is so new that there is no standard definition of what an MTD is, what is meant by diversification and randomization, or what metrics to define the effectiveness of such systems. Moreover, the changing nature of MTD violates two basic assumptions about the conventional attack surface notion. One is that the attack surface remains unchanged during an attack and the second is that it is always reachable. Therefore, a new attack surface definition is needed. To address these issues, I propose that a theoretical framework for MTD be defined. The framework should clarify the most basic questions such as what an MTD system is and its properties such as adaptation, diversification and randomization. The framework should reveal what is meant by gaining and losing knowledge, and what are different attack types. To reason over the interactions between attacker and MTD system, the framework should define key concepts such as attack surface, adaptation surface and <b>engagement</b> <b>surface.</b> Based on that, this framework should allow MTD system designers to decide how to use existing configuration choices and functionality diversification to increase security. It should allow them to analyze the effectiveness of adapting various combinations of different configuration aspects to thwart different types of attacks. To support analysis, the frame- work should include an analytical model that can be used by designers to determine how different parameter settings will impact system security...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} association between authenticity and work engagement within the customer service context of mass-service industries. Authenticity in customer service workers is usually considered detrimental to organisational aims for a consistent standard of good service. However, research which finds that acting the service-persona is associated with emotional exhaustion and cynicism in workers (Brotheridge & Lee, 2002), while authenticity is related to positive customer-outcomes (Bujisic, Wu, Mattila, & Bilgihan, 2014), suggests that authenticity may enhance the experience of service for workers, and their customers, to provide for sustained competitive advantage. In the present research, I sought {{to examine the relationship}} between the degree of authenticity that employees use in their interaction with customers, and their experience of work engagement. Mass-service refers to a sector of the service industry modelled on mass-production. Contrary to principles for work engagement, workers in customer service roles within mass-service, usually repeat a small range of tasks with very little variation or autonomy. One hundred and forty service employees in petrol stations, fast food outlets, supermarkets, and in general retail responded to a survey measuring the extent to which they felt authentic, used surface acting and deep acting, their state of self-efficacy, feelings of personal accomplishment, and work engagement. Results revealed a positive relationship between authenticity and work <b>engagement.</b> <b>Surface</b> acting emerged as a less authentic approach to service than deep acting, however, deep acting was not strongly related to authenticity. Personal accomplishment strongly moderated associations with work engagement. Overall, results suggest that an authentic approach to interaction with customers and a sense of personal accomplishment are important to work engagement in mass-service workers. Findings support the promotion of authenticity in the workplace, as well as providing opportunities for workers to obtain a sense of accomplishment. Practical implications for the integration of authenticity into the customer service context, such as greater job autonomy and training customer service employees in the beneficial use of personality within the service-role, are discussed...|$|E
