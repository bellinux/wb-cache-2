40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) is {{a standard}} clinical procedure for treating many cardiac arrhythmias. In order to increase the success rate of this treatment, the evaluation of lesion development {{with the help of}} intracardiac electrogram (EGM) criteria has to be improved further. We are investigating in-vitro the electrophysiological characteristics of cardiac tissue by using fluorescence-optical and electrical techniques. In this project, it is intended to create ablation lesions under defined conditions in rat atria or ventricle and to determine the electrical activity in the myocardium surrounding these lesions less than 1 s after the ablation. Therefore, we developed a semi-automatic RFA procedure, which was integrated into an existing experimental setup. Firstly, a controllable protection circuit board was designed to <b>galvanically</b> <b>isolate</b> the sensitive amplifiers for measuring extracellular potentials during the ablation. Secondly, a real-time system was implemented to control and to autonomously monitor the RFA procedure. We verified each component as well as the different sequences of the RFA procedure.

50|$|The main {{function}} of an opto-isolator is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, {{so that a}} surge {{in one part of}} the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts. Historically, this function was delegated to isolation transformers, which use inductive coupling between <b>galvanically</b> <b>isolated</b> input and output sides. Transformers and opto-isolators are the only two classes of electronic devices that offer reinforced protection — they protect both the equipment and the human user operating this equipment. They contain a single physical isolation barrier, but provide protection equivalent to double isolation. Safety, testing and approval of opto-couplers are regulated by national and international standards: IEC 60747-5-2, EN (CENELEC) 60747-5-2, UL 1577, CSA Component Acceptance Notice #5, etc. Opto-isolator specifications published by manufacturers always follow at least one of these regulatory frameworks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The market foir {{photovoltaic}} systems has considerablv {{developed during the}} last few years, be it for gridconnected power generation or along the sun applications. However, the cost of solar modules remains a sensitive issue which entails the need for a better use of available power. In this paper, we present an architecture allowiiing the operation of each separate photovoltaic module at his optimum, independently of other modules. For this purpose, we consider the use {{of a large number of}} small converters, each of them being associated to one photovoltaic module, instead of only one converter. To be economicallv feasible, we propose a structure which allows simultaneously to <b>galvanically</b> <b>isolate</b> the module from the grid, to increase the voltage, to concert DC current to AC current. The whole structure ensures that the power conversion is done with reduced losses. The converter structure is also designed for parallel operation with as many modules as necessary in order to obtain the desired power. It ensues that the dynamic response of a module must be carefullv studied to avoid any unforeseen oscillation betwieen two or more different converters or between a module and others loads distributed along the network...|$|R

This is not the case. What matters is not how many repeaters are using but rather how many repeaters any data packet, originating at a Scanner or Gateway, has to cross before reaching the I/O node. Due to the tight timing constraints defined each packet can at most travel across two repeaters before reaching an AS-Interface node. This has the following consequences: ...|$|R

40|$|Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, such as {{gallium nitride}} (GaN), {{are more and}} more being used in {{switching}} power devices. An AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN Double Heterojunction Field Effect transistor (DHFET) was developed in previous work and needed to be tested. The used test circuit was a buck converter. This type of converter, in addition with the normally-on switching behaviour of the GaN-based transistors, requires dedicated gate drive circuitry, resulting in the development of three types of gate-drivers. This paper presents the topology and performance of these drivers. Because of the type of converter, the drivers need to be <b>galvanically</b> <b>isolated.</b> Furthermore, because the experimental GaN transistors are normally-on, the drivers need to be robust so that they apply a negative gate-to-source voltage to switch off the transistor in case an error occurs in the driver. A third requirement for the drivers is {{that it has to be}} easy to adjust the voltage levels, in order to test the devices at different gate-to-source voltage conditions. A final requirement is that it has to be possible to construct the drivers with readily available electronic components. Because the drivers are <b>galvanically</b> <b>isolated,</b> there is a parasitic isolation capacitance in the DC-DC-converter of the drivers.
