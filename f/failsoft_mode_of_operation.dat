This includes the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode when there is no integrity protection of the initialisation vector (IV). In particular, we show that it is possible in such instances to replace a block at the beginning, middle, or end of a CBC-encrypted message. We further demonstrate that the security of the electronic codebook (ECB) mode, and show that in the absence of integrity, one could exploit this to aid in known- and chosen- IV attacks. Finally, we present chosen-IV slide attacks on counter (CTR) and output feedback (OFB) <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Our results show that protocol implementers should carefully select <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Our results show that protocol implementers should carefully select <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> be aware <b>of</b> the pitfalls in each <b>of</b> these <b>modes,</b> and incorporate countermeasures in their protocols to overcome them.

So far, the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> block ciphers have been treated as completely independent and uncorrelated.
