Many face detection applications use the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> detection <b>system</b> which is proposed by Viola and Jones in 2004. Viola and Jones used the Adaboost training algorithm and the Haar-like features in their proposed traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> detection <b>system,</b> which has a high detection rate but long training time. Many studies have attempted to reduce the training time and retain the high detection rate of the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> detection <b>system.</b> However, the detection rate of the Adaboost-based <b>face</b> detection <b>system</b> cannot compete with the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> detection <b>system</b> when the training time is reduced significantly. This study proposes the judging existence of eye region (JEER) method to enhance the detection rate of the previous Adaboost-based <b>face</b> detection <b>systems.</b> The eyes are more salient and representative features than the other facial parts such as the mouth or ears, especially when mask is worn on the human face. Therefore, the proposed <b>face</b> detection <b>system</b> with the JEER method achieves higher detection rate than the Adaboost-based <b>face</b> detection <b>systems.</b> Although the JEER computation results in a slightly longer training time, the training time of the proposed <b>face</b> detection <b>system</b> is still much shorter than the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> detection <b>system</b> owing to the efficient JEER computation.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been given in recent months to the complexity of issues surrounding broadband policy for Australia. While there appears to be widespread support that Australia needs to move from what might presently be called 'rudimentary' or possibly 'adequate' broadband, and largely only for urban dwellers, there are many calls for the urgent availability of 'enabling' broadband. The unravelling of these terms depends upon what users expect from broadband, what speeds they require, and how much they are prepared to pay for the service. There is widespread perception, however, that Australia currently remains in the slow lane for broadband by international comparison, and concerns in many quarters about how problems are being addressed to change this situation. There are policy and regulatory problems, complex issues <b>facing</b> <b>system</b> operators, reluctance by investors to risk the substantial capital required to build the infrastructure, tough choices relating to modes and practices of delivery, and doubts about the possible level of acceptance and take-up by the end users. This paper supports the view that while it is in the national interest to work towards a 'broadband for all' policy, it argues that Australia currently faces a crisis of innovation in telecommunications. The nature of this crisis in the context of broadband is discussed in this paper around three themes: 1. The 'bottlenecks' that have emerged subsequent to the introduction of the public policy model of Open Competition for Australian telecommunications from July 1997. 2. The issues associated with network access and investment, affordability and broadband speed. 3. The complexities <b>facing</b> <b>system</b> operators to understand and create user demand.

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} wind power forecasting {{is essential to}} power system operation. Given significant uncertainties involved in wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks <b>facing</b> <b>system</b> operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated confidence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods. Case studies using real wind farm data from Australia have been conducted. Comparing with benchmarks applied, experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and reliability of the developed approach. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method provides a new generalized framework for probabilistic wind power forecasting with high reliability and flexibility and has a high potential of practical applications in power systems.

40|$|Leshchinsky, DovTraditionally, {{resultant}} force of lateral earth pressure {{serves as the}} basis for design nearly vertical walls. Conversely, slopes are designed to be stable using a factor of safety approach. However, with the availability of heavy facing elements such as gabions or with soil reinforcement combined with some <b>facing</b> <b>system,</b> steep slopes are increasingly being constructed. Steep slopes are considered to be unstable unless supported; that is, such slopes require facings to resist lateral earth pressure. Extending Coulomb‟s formulation to such slopes may not be conservative as a planar slip surface may not be critical. Presented are the results of a formulation to find the resultant lateral force which utilizes the log-spiral failure mechanism. The friction at the interface soil-facing is assumed to act on vertical surface only thus replicating the geometry of stacked rectangular facing units. Given the batter, the backslope, the height, the unit weight and design friction angle of the backfill, and the interface friction, one can quickly determine the corresponding lateral earth pressure coefficient. Formulation equivalent to Coulomb‟s is also presented. Its results show that for batters up to 20 °, the common approach of using Coulomb method, including the assumed direction to coincide with the batter, yield results that are quite close to those stemming from the log-spiral analysis. Hence, use of Coulomb‟s analysis for such small batters is a reasonable as its formulation is simple. University of Delaware, Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringM. C. E...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Noise {{induced by}} {{impedance}} discontinuities from VLSI pack-aging {{is one of}} the leading challenges <b>facing</b> <b>system</b> level designers in the next decade. The performance of IC cores far exceeds that of current packaging technology. The risetimes of IC signals require that the interconnect of the package be treated as transmission lines. As a result, impedance discon-tinuities in the package cause reflections which may result in intermittent switching of digital signals and edge time degradation, both of which limit system performance. The major cause of the impedance discontinuity in the package is the high inductance of the wire bond interconnect. To compensate for this problem, capacitance can be placed near the wire bond to reduce its effective impedance over a given frequency range. This paper presents the application of this impedance matching technique for use in broadband digital signals that are prevalent in modern VLSI designs. Both static and dynamic compensation approaches are presented. The static compensator places pre-defined capacitances on the package and on the IC to surround the wire bond inductance. The dynamic compensator places a switchable capacitance on the IC that can be programmed to a desired value, thereby enabling the designer to overcome design and manufacturing variations in the wire bond. Both techniques presented are shown to bound the reflections of the wire bond to less than 5 % (down from 20 % for an uncompensated structure) for wire bonds up to 5 mm in length, and for frequencies up to 3 GHz. In addition, both circuits utilizes less area than a typical wire bond pad, making them ideal for placement directly beneath the wire bond pads. I...|$|E
40|$|Roller {{compacted}} concrete (RCC) is frequently {{used to construct}} gravity dams, stepped spillways, and to armor earthen embankments for passing extreme floods. Early experience on RCC dam applications in the 1980 s showed a tendency for seepage to develop along the lift lines. Therefore, RCC dam designers started including an upstream <b>facing</b> <b>system</b> as a watertight barrier. An alternative facing material {{that has been used}} extensively overseas and is starting to gain more widespread acceptance in the United States is Grout Enriched RCC (GERCC). The grout enriched method of face construction {{has been shown to be}} less expensive than other facing options, particularly on larger dam projects. However, in the United States, the use of GERCC technology has been fairly limited, primarily due to concern over the material’s freeze-thaw resistance. Achieving cost-effective GERCC air entrainment and consolidation can significantly advance the competitiveness of RCC versus other alternatives. The objective of this project is to develop a grout formulation and construction technique that allows the production of air entrained GERCC. The study includes four phases to systemically achieve this objective: (1) optimizing grout formulation including type and dosage of chemical admixtures, (2) evaluation of small scale laboratory samples of RCC and grout combined in a mixer, (3) evaluation of large scale laboratory samples of RCC and grout combined simulating field construction techniques, and (4) conducting a field trial. The results of Phases 1 and 2 (presented herein) show that when the grout and RCC are combined in a mixer, good freeze-thaw resistance can be achieved. Phases 3 and 4 are currently underway. Through additional research, the project team’s goal is to advance the use of GERCC and promote more cost effective and technically viable construction of gravity dams, stepped spillways, armored earthen embankments and other hydraulic structures in climates subject to freeze-thaw cycles...|$|E

In software development environments, object-oriented modelling and programming (and even testing) is by far dominating.

In the recent years, the database communities have tried to converge the database technology and the software development technologies.

The emerging new data model is generally known as the object-relational database model. SQL has gone through a large revision, with many new features added. A major new version of the standard was published in 1999. This new version is commonly known as SQL- 99. This thesis will first describe what an object-relational database actually is. This description will be based on several sources (Stonebraker et. al. 1990), (Stonebraker & Moore 1996) and (Gulutzan & Pelzer 1999) in addition to the standard itself.
