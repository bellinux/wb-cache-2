50|$|Changes in ICF-CY codes {{over time}} reflect {{developmental}} effects {{attributable to the}} child’s interaction with the environment. Environmental factors influence functioning and development and can be documented as barriers or facilitators using the ICF-CY. The key environments {{of children and adolescents}} include their <b>homes,</b> <b>day</b> care centers, <b>schools</b> and recreation settings of playground, parks, and ball fields. Children will transition between different environments many times as they grow. For example, a child will transition into elementary or high school or from one service setting or agency to another. Attention to these transitions of children with disabilities has been identified as an important role for health care providers. A transition requires preparation and planning to find an appropriate and accommodating setting for a child’s needs. With a coding system such as the ICF-CY, the transition will be smoother and interventions can start where the previous health provider left off.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{man-made}} disasters have denied {{millions of people}} access to safe drinking water. Large-scale water contamination has resulted in toxic water at kitchen faucets, economic impacts, illnesses, and fatalities. Often, technologies have been applied to help communities recover, but results have been frequently misstated. For more than 30 years, officials have also increasingly relied on new water pipe repair technologies to reduce water pipe leakage and improve water quality. Today, evidence indicates that certain water pipe repair technologies can cause toxic air inside <b>homes,</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>day</b> care centers, office buildings, the environment, and even contaminate drinking water supplies. Past incidents have resulted in persons seeking medical assistance and reporting symptoms such as nausea, headache, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and eye and nasal irritation. HAZMAT responses and building evacuations have also occurred. Technology misapplication and failure to design out critical flaws contribute to these incidents. A new approach to education and environmentally responsible innovation is needed. We must reinvent our approach to bringing water technologies to market – and understand {{how to use them}} responsibly...|$|R
