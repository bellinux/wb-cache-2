5|$|These {{and several}} other accusations brought public and {{political}} pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first <b>investigations</b> both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second <b>investigations</b> led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice (equivalent to State Attorney General) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months. On November 29, 1983, three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after {{a report by the}} state Senate <b>Investigations</b> Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two <b>investigations.</b> This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the <b>investigations</b> since the shootings occurred in 1978.|$|E

5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney <b>Investigations</b> 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011.

5|$|Ace Attorney <b>Investigations</b> 2 is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases; {{in one of the}} cases, the player also controls Edgeworth's father Gregory. The gameplay is mostly the same as in the previous game, , and is divided into two types of phases: <b>investigations</b> and rebuttals.|$|E
5|$|Ace Attorney <b>Investigations</b> 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace Attorney <b>Investigations</b> had taken longer than usual for an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney <b>Investigations</b> 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney <b>Investigations</b> was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E
