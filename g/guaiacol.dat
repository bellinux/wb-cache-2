This study focused on improving the selectivity of bio-oilby catalytic pyrolysis of biomass using activated carbon (AC) catalysts. Firstly, the effects of process conditions on product quality and product yield were investigated by catalytic microwave pyrolysis of biomass using AC as a catalyst. The optimized reaction condition for bio-oil and volatile was determined. Chemical composition analysis by GC/MS showed that phenols rich bio-oils were obtained. Furthermore, the effects of different carbon sources based AC catalysts on products yield and chemical composition selectivity of obtained bio-oils were investigated during microwave pyrolysis of Douglas fir pellet. The catalysts recycling test of the selected catalysts indicated that the AC catalysts can be used for 3 - 4 times with high concentration of phenolic compounds. The individual surface polar/acidic oxygen functional groups analysis suggested the changes of functional groups in ACs explained the reaction mechanism of this process. In addition, the potential for production of renewable phenols and fuels by catalytic pyrolysis of biomass using lignin as a model compound was explored. The main chemical compounds of the obtained bio-oils were phenols, <b>guaiacols,</b> hydrocarbons and esters. The thermal decomposition behaviors of lignin and kinetics study were investigated by TGA. The change of functional groups of AC catalyst indicated the bio-oil reduction was related to the reaction mechanism of this process. Finally, the effects of Fe-modified AC catalyst on bio-oil upgrading and kintic study of biomass pyrolysis were investigated.

By using 2, 6 -dibromophenol, 4, 5, 6 -trichloroguaiacol, and pentachlorothiophenol as the substrates, O-methylation activity was also demonstrated in extracts from two other Rhodococcus sp. strains, an Acinetobacter sp. strain, and a Pseudomonas sp. strain. A diverse range of chloro- and bromophenols, chlorothiophenols, chloro- and bromoguaiacols, and chloro- and bromocatechols were assayed as the substrates by using extracts prepared from strain 1395; all of the compounds were methylated to the corresponding anisoles, veratroles, or <b>guaiacols,</b> which have been identified previously from experiments using whole cells. The specific activity of the enzyme towards the thiophenols was significantly higher than it was towards all the other substrates—high activity was found with pentafluorothiophenol, although the activity with pentafluorophenol was undetectable with the incubation times used.

30|$|Catalytic {{depolymerization}} {{is dominated}} by thermochemical transformations to monomeric phenols and typically requires harsh conditions due to {{the stability of the}} polyphenolic lignin structure. Organosolv lignin is more sensitive to hydrogenolysis due to its high degree of unsaturation and low molecular weight [24]. Bifunctional catalysts, containing both acid and noble metal sites, have attracted interest in this arena, since they can simultaneously cleave ether bonds and deoxygenate the resulting phenolic monomers in the presence of molecular H 2 or a H-donor solvent. The use of noble metal catalysts favours a mixture of cyclohexane derivatives and products arising from C–C bond cleavage. Metallic nickel has shown the most promise for the production of phenolics from lignin due to its superior propensity for cleaving aryl–aryl C–O–C bonds and C–OH bonds in side chains containing CH 3 or CH 2 functions, commonly yielding C 1 –C 3 alkane-substituted <b>guaiacols</b> as the major product [25]. In the case of lignosulfates, Ni catalysts show good resistance to sulfur poisoning, while remaining active and selective for the transformation of lignosulfate into phenolics. While nickel is able to cleavage C–O aliphatic bonds, it is less active for the rupture of aromatic C–O and arene bonds. Lignin conversion to alkane-substituted <b>guaiacols</b> over Ni catalysts is independent of the support type (e.g., activated carbon, zeolite, or MgO) [25]. Higher conversions were obtained in the presence of diol or triol functions, such us glycerol and ethylene glycol. Song and co-workers concluded that for lignosulfates, Ni(0) active sites catalyse hydrogenolysis of C–O–C bonds, C–OH bonds in side alkyl chains, and the reduction of sulfonate groups into hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) [25].|$|R

25|$|Wood-tar {{creosote}} is a colourless to yellowish greasy liquid with a smoky odor, {{produces a}} sooty flame when burned, {{and has a}} burned taste. It is non-buoyant in water, with a specific gravity of 1.037 to 1.087, retains fluidity at a very low temperature, and boils at 205-225°C. When transparent, it is in its purest form. Dissolution in water requires up to 200 {{times the amount of}} water as the base creosote. The creosote is a combination of natural phenols: primarily <b>guaiacol</b> and creosol (4-methylguaiacol), which will typically constitute 50% of the oil; second in prevalence, cresol and xylenol; the rest being a combination of monophenols and polyphenols.|$|E
25|$|Because wood-tar {{creosote}} is {{used for}} its <b>guaiacol</b> and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with {{a higher proportion of}} those chemicals to other phenolics. The creosote can be obtained by distilling the wood tar and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|E
25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote.

The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. <b>Guaiacol</b> is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin.

Douglas fir sawdust pellet (DF) was used as feedstock. The reaction conditions were optimized with central composite experimental design (CCD). GC/MS was used to analyse bio-oil chemical composition. The bio-oil from in-situ microwave assisted catalytic pyrolysis resulted in a series of important and useful chemical compounds: phenols, <b>guaiacols,</b> and aromatic hydrocarbons. Phenols and <b>guaiacols</b> were the most abundant compounds which were about 50 - 82 % in bio-oil depending on the pyrolysis conditions. Ex-situ catalytic cracking close coupled to microwave assisted pyrolysis process was conducted from direct catalytic cracking of DF pyrolysis vapor. The aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched and became the most abundant compounds accounting for about 15 - 92. 6 % in the bio-oils depending on the catalytic pyrolysis conditions. The aromatic hydrocarbons were mainly composed of benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, and there derivatives. High cracking temperature and inverse weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) - 1 favored the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. The fresh ZSM- 5 catalyst has a high selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbon, and the used ZSM- 5 catalyst still has a moderate selectivity for phenols. The ZSM- 5 catalyst was stable during the catalytic reaction cycles. Zinc modified ZSM- 5 catalysts were synthesized and tested in ex-situ catalytic cracking close coupled to microwave assisted pyrolysis process. It was found that the Zn loading on ZSM- 5 catalyst could lower the coke and made the process more sensitive to the (WHSV) - 1, less sensitive to the cracking temperature than ZSM- 5 catalyst. The thermal decomposition behavior and kinetics of DF pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis were analyzed. Adding catalysts tended to slightly lower the temperature of thermal degrading process.

The major volatile products from G-lignins in this stage include coniferyl alcohol (R: −CH=CH−CH 2 OH), coniferyl aldehyde (R: −CH=CH−CHO), isoeugenol (R: −CH=CH−CH 3), 4 -vinylguaiacol (R: −CH=CH 2), vanillin (R: −CHO), acetovanillone (R: −CO−CH 3), and dihydroconiferyl alcohol (R: −CH 2 −CH 2 −CH 2 OH).|$|R
