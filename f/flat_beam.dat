By {{carrying}} out pseudo-dynamic test on an unbonded and a bonded prestressed concrete <b>flat</b> <b>beam</b> separately, their dynamic properties and seismic responses can be learned; also seismic resistance can be compared. The test {{results show that}} framework with prestressed concrete <b>flat</b> <b>beam</b> has certain energy-absorbing capacity, and no matter bonded form or not it makes little influence on overall seismic performance and failure form. In addition, the beam-column strength ratio should be increased properly in design. Preface Due to reasonable structural design and convenient construction, floor system with prestressed concrete <b>flat</b> <b>beam</b> has highly potential on reducing floor height, saving cost and satisfying building requirement.
