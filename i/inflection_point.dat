40|$|We {{have already}} defined the evolutes and the {{involute}}s of fronts without <b>inflection</b> <b>points.</b> For regular curves or fronts, {{we can not}} define the evolutes at <b>inflection</b> <b>points.</b> On the other hand, the involutes can be defined at <b>inflection</b> <b>points.</b> In this case, the involute is not a front but a frontal at <b>inflection</b> <b>points.</b> We define evolutes of frontals under conditions. The definition is a generalisation of both evolutes of regular curves and of fronts. By using relationship between evolutes and involutes of frontals, we give an existence condition of the evolute with <b>inflection</b> <b>points.</b> We also give properties of evolutes and involutes of frontals. ...|$|R

For example, the recall rate of δ-approximate <b>inflection</b> <b>points</b> reaches 96 % when α= 0.1.

While the standard Falkner—Skan flow does not have any <b>inflection</b> <b>points</b> in a favourable pressure gradient, the first non–unique solution branch has two such points.

25|$|Horizontal rolls are {{counter-rotating}} vortex rolls {{that are}} nearly {{aligned with the}} mean wind of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). They {{can be caused by}} convection {{in the presence of a}} moderate wind and/or dynamic <b>inflection</b> <b>point</b> instabilities in the mean wind profile. Early theory on the features predict that the vortices may be aligned up to 30° to the left for stably stratified environments, 18° to the left for neutral environments, and nearly parallel to the mean wind for unstably stratified (convective) environments. This theory has been supported by aircraft observations from several field experiments.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} for addition works {{except in a}} few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is {{when one of the}} points is O. Here, we define P + O = P = O + P, making O the identity of the group. Next, if P and Q are opposites of each other, we define P + Q = O. Lastly, if P = Q we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point R and we can take its opposite. However, if P happens to be an <b>inflection</b> <b>point</b> (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take R to be P itself and P + P is simply the point opposite itself.|$|E

[...] In 1999, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] earned Spears her first three MTV Video Music Award nominations, in the categories of Best Pop Video, Best Choreography, and Best Female Video. In a list compiled by VH1 in 2001, it was listed at number ninety in the best videos of all time. The video was the first of fourteen of her videos to retire on MTV's television series TRL. On its final episode, a three-hour special aired on November 16, 2008, [...] "…Baby One More Time" [...] was number one in their final countdown as the most iconic music videos of all time and was the last video to be played on the show. Wesley Yang in his essay [...] "Inside the Box" [...] in n+1, compared the music video to Britny Fox's [...] "Girlschool" [...] because it featured [...] "a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [...] But that was a sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something else—an <b>inflection</b> <b>point</b> in the culture".

[...] The music video is also referenced in the 2009 single, [...] "If U Seek Amy". After she comes out of the house dressed as a housewife, her daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. The video was ranked at number four on a list of the ten most controversial music videos in pop by AOL on September 29, 2011.
