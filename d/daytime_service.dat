5|$|Currently, {{the only}} {{service in the}} suburb is the 387 <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> between Warwick and Perth via Balcatta Road, which travels along Eglinton Crescent. Eastern Hamersley {{does not have a}} direct service, other than those along Erindale and Wanneroo Roads. However, service along Wanneroo Road is very limited outside {{standard}} weekday hours.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} facing the early power companies was the hourly variable demand. When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high during the first hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked. As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide <b>daytime</b> <b>service,</b> with two-thirds providing no <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> in 1897.|$|E

5000|$|Night-based {{services}} may be differently branded compared to <b>daytime</b> <b>services,</b> {{such as in}} London, where overnight buses are prefixed with an [...] "N" [...] for [...] "night". Another common way of distinguishing them from their daytime counterparts are dark-colored line numbers. Some cities apply a different fare structure from their <b>daytime</b> <b>services.</b> There are also services that allow users to alight at a requested place of stopping rather than at specific locations, in deference to passenger concerns about safely walking long distances.|$|R
25|$|The two {{stations}} {{experimented with}} different frequencies. After a short test on 773kHz in late 1975, in May 1976, Radio Caroline began a <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> on 1562kHz (192 m) using a 10kW transmitter, while its overnight service continued {{to share the}} 50kW transmitter with Radio Mi Amigo's daytime programming on 1187kHz (253 metres, announced as 259).|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, Caroline {{was one of}} few {{stations in}} the South East still broadcasting. However, the storm had weakened the mast, which collapsed in another storm later. Caroline returned to the air using a makeshift aerial with a less powerful signal. This {{was replaced by a}} twin-mast T-antenna. For several months only one transmitter could be used, leading to the loss of the income-generating Radio Monique, although a substitute Dutch <b>daytime</b> <b>service,</b> Radio 558 (later Radio 819), was eventually established.|$|E
25|$|Starting on April 18, 1965, most <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> was rerouted to Dyre Avenue, {{replacing}} Dyre Shuttle except {{evenings and}} late nights. Some weekday rush peak-direction service to 241st Street was retained, while Saturday and Sunday evening trains were cut back from 241st Street to East 180th Street. Also, Saturday morning trains were cut back from Atlantic Avenue to South Ferry. Starting on May 3, 1965, trains {{to or from}} 241st Street began making all stops between Gun Hill Road and East 180th Street.|$|E
25|$|Early {{electrification}} was too {{limited to}} have a big impact on the late 19th century economy. Electricity was also very expensive because of the low conversion efficiency of fuel to power, the small scale of power plants and the fact that most utilities offered only nighttime service. <b>Daytime</b> <b>service</b> became common during the early 20th century after the introduction of the AC motor, which tended to be used more during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or electric street railway (tram or streetcar).|$|E

Cango, run by Stagecoach, operate a service linking villages between Basingstoke and Alton. Basingstoke Community Transport and Communities First Wessex run some smaller routes. A park and ride shuttle operated by Stagecoach links Basingstoke Leisure Park with Basing View, via Basingstoke Railway Station.

2500|$|It {{was decided}} to {{introduce}} the railcar to a <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> between Auckland and Wellington. [...] This service, which started on Monday 23 September 1968, was highly successful and prompted the conversion of two further cars to 82 seats each to accommodate larger servery areas and, later, {{the purchase of the}} Silver Fern diesel-electric railcars for this service.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{electricity}} was used primarily for lighting and most electric companies did not provide <b>daytime</b> <b>service.</b> [...] Electric motors that were used in daytime, such as the DC motors that powered street railways, helped balance the load, and many street railways generated their own electricity and also operated as electric utilities. [...] The AC motor, developed in the 1890s, was ideal for industrial and commercial power and greatly increased the demand for electricity, particular during daytime.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1969 {{timetable}} {{there were}} early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services {{that by the}} late 1970s were running through to Inverness. In 1962 the Elizabethans six-hour schedule between London and Edinburgh meant a 9:30am London departure gave a 9:30pm arrival at Inverness, with 33 minutes allowed for changing trains at Edinburgh, and a through <b>daytime</b> <b>service</b> from Inverness to London via Perth started in 1974 with the Clansman, and this was replaced in 1984 by the Highland Chieftain with a schedule of about [...] hours.|$|E
