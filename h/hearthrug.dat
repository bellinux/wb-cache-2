5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her <b>hearthrug,</b> her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are minutely detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the text.|$|E

2500|$|Furniture {{upholstered}} in light blue, light blue curtains, and imported French silver wallpaper {{with a gold}} border {{were added to the}} East Room by the Martin Van Buren administration in 1839. At some point prior to the inauguration of President William Henry Harrison in March 1841, the East Room acquired eight floor-to-ceiling mirrors with broad, heavily carved frames. President James K. Polk had the White House plumbed for gas heating and lighting in 1848. Cornelius & Company of Philadelphia retrofitted the 1834 chandeliers for gas, and Polk himself watched their first lighting. By the end of the Polk administration in January 1849, the East Room was adorned with three chandeliers, three [...] "pier glasses" [...] (mirrors), red damask window drapes, white muslin window curtains, four new sofas, 24 new chairs, three large tables (placed {{in the center of the}} room), four pier tables with marble tops, a large carpet, four new <b>hearthrugs,</b> four fire fenders, four large candelabra, eight small candelabra, eight mantle ornaments, and a bust of George Washington.|$|R

'Twas Tony's party that had done it, plain enough, and they half wished they had never gone there. James, being a quiet, fireside, perusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his wife, who loved riding and driving and out--door jaunts to a degree; while Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very domestic wife, who worked samplers, and made <b>hearthrugs,</b> scarcely ever wished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.|$|R
