40|$|Abstract: To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} roller deformation on the workpiece during the rolling process of <b>H-beams,</b> {{it is essential to}} consider the force exerted on the rollers and the deformation thereof. For this purpose, a three-dimension thermo-mechanical coupling model has been built with the finite element analytical package ABAQUS to simulate the hot rolling process of <b>H-beams.</b> In particular, the simulation is conducted under the assumption that the rollers are elastic and rolling torque imposed unilaterally, which agrees with the practical rolling conditions. Noting the results of FEM simulation, the metal flow and temperature distribution have been obtained. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed simulation, comparisons of the roller contact reaction and temperature between the simulated and measured values have been made. The simulation is meaningful for preparing continuous rolling procedures of <b>H-beams...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} and catenary action of axially restrained steel beam under impact loadings is examined {{through a combination}} of experimental and numerical investigations. It describes and discusses the results of six impact tests on the axially restrained welded <b>H-beams</b> by means of the drop hammer test machine. The main behavioural patterns and the key response characteristics including the development of impact force, deformation and strain, as well as failure modes are examined, with emphasis on the effect of impact energy and the width to thickness ratio of beam flange. Finite element models are also developed and validated against the available testing results. It is demonstrated that the detailed FE model can capture the response of the welded <b>H-beams</b> under impact loadings. Moreover, the mechanism of catenary action was identified based {{on the development of the}} internal force in the welded <b>H-beams...</b>|$|R

The analysis results showed that low axial compression ratio has a little influence on the bearing capacity; with the increase of axial pressure the bearing capacity will decrease in a high axial compression ratio, moreover the failure pattern of joint changes from beam end to column end. The ductility of the specimens is decreased by raising axial compression ratio...|$|R
5000|$|After several {{clashes with}} Morgan and fellow US Steel {{executive}} Elbert Gary, Schwab left USS in 1903 {{to run the}} Bethlehem Shipbuilding and Steel Company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Code-named [...] "Terminator" [...] by the SVT {{development}} crew led by John Coletti, numerous improvements were made to the powertrain and driveline to handle the power increase from the previous model's set-up. A cast-iron block was used, instead of the previous Teksid aluminum unit, with stronger internals including forged Zolner pistons and Manley <b>H-beam</b> connecting rods that were modified with a wrist pin oiling hole by the SVT engineers. These upgrades were critical in order to support the [...] of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M-112 roots-type supercharger. Other improvements included the use of a lightweight aluminum flywheel connected to a Tremec T-56 six-speed transmission, 3.55:1 rear axle ratio, and stronger 31-spline halfshafts with revised upper and lower control arms. These modifications enabled the Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds and do the quarter mile in 12.67 seconds at 110.11 mph.
