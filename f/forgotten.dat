5|$|Although the Realms were {{yet to be}} an {{official}} campaign world, the module , released in 1985 by TSR, is now {{considered to be a}} part of the <b>Forgotten</b> Realms, although it wasn't until module H3 The Bloodstone Wars was released that <b>Forgotten</b> Realms became the official setting for the module series. The first official <b>Forgotten</b> Realms product was Douglas Niles's Darkwalker on Moonshae, the first book in The Moonshae Trilogy, which predates the <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Campaign Set by one month.|$|E

5|$|With {{the release}} of the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, the <b>Forgotten</b> Realms were updated again to the new rules system, {{featuring}} a very changed Realms and moving the fictional world's timeline 104 years into the future. The <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Campaign Guide, released August 2008, is a 288-page book for Dungeon Masters. The <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Player's Guide was released the following month, and contains information for players to help create <b>Forgotten</b> Realms characters. An adventure, Scepter Tower of Spellgard, was also released in September 2008 and can be used in combination with the adventure in the <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Campaign Guide to start a <b>Forgotten</b> Realms campaign. In 2008, the <b>Forgotten</b> Realms also became the setting for the RPGA's sole living campaign, Living <b>Forgotten</b> Realms, replacing Living Greyhawk. In 2011, the Neverwinter Campaign Setting was released.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{in general terms}} the particular forms of <b>forgetting</b> used in (Lin and Reiter [2; 3]).

40|$|People can {{intentionally}} <b>forget</b> previously studied material if, after study, a <b>forget</b> cue {{is provided}} and new material is learned. It {{has recently been}} suggested that such list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> arises because the <b>forget</b> cue induces a change in internal context and causes context-dependent <b>forgetting</b> of the studied material (L. Sahakyan & C. M. Kelley, 2002). The authors compared directed <b>forgetting</b> and context-dependent <b>forgetting</b> by examining whether, like a <b>forget</b> cue, a change in internal context needs subsequent learning of new material to be effective. Participants studied an item list and, after study, received a remember cue or a <b>forget</b> cue or their internal context was changed through an imagination task. In each condition, half the participants learned a second list, {{and the other half}} fulfilled an unrelated distractor task. Both the <b>forget</b> cue and the change in internal context induced <b>forgetting</b> of the first list only when learning of the second list was interpolated. These results suggest that postcue encoding of new material is crucial for both directed <b>forgetting</b> and (some forms of) context-dependent <b>forgetting...</b>|$|R

Before entering a portal into the <b>Forgotten</b> One's prison, Laura tells Gabriel he cannot enter it in his mortal form and dies after she has Gabriel drink her blood to use its powers to enter, turning him into a vampire. During Resurrection, the <b>Forgotten</b> One aspires to destroy the humans' world, but he is defeated by Gabriel who claims his power for himself. Corrupted by the <b>Forgotten</b> One's power, Gabriel destroys his Combat Cross and leaves through the portal.|$|E

40|$|One {{way people}} control the {{contents}} of their minds is intentional forgetting—voluntarily <b>forgetting</b> events after they have happened. The events people would most like to <b>forget</b> are unpleasant and emotional. This study used a directed <b>forgetting</b> procedure with emotional and neutral pictures to examine whether people can intentionally <b>forget</b> emotional events as easily as mundane ones. When the to-be-forgotten list was neutral, participants showed successful intentional <b>forgetting.</b> But when the to-be-forgotten list was emotional, directed <b>forgetting</b> failed. Results contribute to understanding the ways that emotion constrains mental control by capturing mental processes including memory retrieval.

40|$|When {{people are}} cued to <b>forget</b> a {{previously}} studied {{list of items}} and {{to learn a new}} list instead, such cuing typically leads to <b>forgetting</b> of the first list, and to memory enhancement of the second. In two experiments, we examined such listwise directed <b>forgetting</b> in children (and adults), using a <b>forget</b> cue that placed either high emphasis or low emphasis on the need to <b>forget.</b> In the low-emphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> was present in fourth graders, but not in first graders (and kindergartners); in contrast, in the highemphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> was present from first grade on. Only fourth graders showed (adult-like) List- 2 enhancement, regardless of task instruction. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> in the high-emphasis condition only points to a production deficiency in first graders’ directed <b>forgetting,</b> suggesting that the children are capable of intentional <b>forgetting</b> but fail to do so spontaneously. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> without List- 2 enhancement suggests that the two directed-forgetting effects are mediated by different processes with different developmental trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} studied how the age {{at which}} words are acquired (Age of Acquisition, AoA) modulates <b>forgetting.</b> Experiment 1 employed the retrieval-practice paradigm to test the effect of AoA on the incidental <b>forgetting</b> that emerges after solving competition during retrieval (i. e., retrieval-induced <b>forgetting,</b> RIF). Standard RIF appeared with late-acquired words, but this effect disappeared with early-acquired words. Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of AoA on intentional <b>forgetting</b> by employing the list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> paradigm. Results showed a standard directed <b>forgetting</b> effect only when the to-be-forgotten words were late-acquired words. These findings point to the prominent role of AoA in <b>forgetting</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|Attempting to {{retrieve}} a target from memory via a retrieval cue can cause competition from the cue's associates, which might block the target. A 1994 study by Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork demonstrated retrieval-induced <b>forgetting</b> for competing associates and suggested that inhibitory control resolving competition causes the <b>forgetting.</b> A 2011 study by Storm, Angello, and Bjork found <b>forgetting</b> for incorrect associates following creative problem solving. This thesis investigated whether such <b>forgetting</b> is also the result of inhibitory control. Competition was manipulated by instructing participants to remember or <b>forget</b> incorrect associates before working on a Remote Associates Test problem. If problem-solving-induced <b>forgetting</b> is caused by inhibition, then to-be-remembered associates should suffer more <b>forgetting</b> than to-be-forgotten associates. Overall, <b>forgetting</b> occurred for incorrect associates participants were instructed to remember and <b>forget.</b> However, the first quartile of trials showed <b>forgetting</b> only for to-be-remembered associates following longer problem solving durations, suggesting a possible role of inhibitory control as an active means to overcome fixation in creative problem solving...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} {{a link between}} sleep and memory consolidation, indicating that sleep in comparison to wakefulness stabilizes memories. However, relatively {{little is known about}} how sleep affects <b>forgetting.</b> Here we examined whether sleep influences directed <b>forgetting,</b> the finding that people can intentionally <b>forget</b> obsolete memories when cued to do so. We applied the list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> task and assessed memory performance after three delay intervals. Directed <b>forgetting</b> was present after a short 20 -min delay and after a 12 -h delay filled with diurnal wakefulness; in contrast, the <b>forgetting</b> was absent after a 12 -h delay that included regular nocturnal sleep. Successful directed <b>forgetting</b> after a delay thus can depend on whether sleep or wakefulness follows upon encoding: when wakefulness follows upon encoding, the <b>forgetting</b> can be successful; when sleep follows upon encoding, no <b>forgetting</b> may arise. Connections of the results to recent studies on the interplay between <b>forgetting</b> and sleep are discussed...|$|R
