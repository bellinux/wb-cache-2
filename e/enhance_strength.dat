5000|$|Recycled: Used {{paper is}} {{collected}} and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres {{in order to}} make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres <b>enhance</b> <b>strength.</b> Mixed waste paper is not usually deinked (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the pulp may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards. Health risks have been associated with using recycled material in direct food contact. Swiss studies have shown that recycled material can contain significant portions of mineral oil, which may migrate into packed foods. Mineral oil levels of up to 19.4 mg/kg were found in rice packed in recycled board.|$|E

If a vampire and a human share blood (each drinking from the other), it will form a blood bond, linking the pair's psyches. Vampire blood without exchange is sought after by humans as a drug that can <b>enhance</b> <b>strength,</b> heal wounds, and increase attractiveness, among other desirable effects. Due to the shortage of willing vampire donors, human [...] "drainers" [...] attack vampires and drain their entire blood supply, either staking the vamps or leaving victims {{to die in the}} sun. The blood is then sold as a drug, in vials on the underground market. It can be highly addictive, but may cause psychotic or murderous rampages by human users upon first use; it is highly unpredictable who will be affected in this manner. In [...] "One Word Answer", a vampire's blood given to a dead body, in combination with magic words, raises the ghost of the body's former inhabitant.|$|E

30|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{illustrate}} elevated strength 30  min after a 2 -min bout of FR, alongside reduced RMS during submaximal activity following FR. This reduced RMS protected the muscles from the fatiguing effects of the protocol, observed through the rest condition. Muscle displacement was increased after three consecutive days of FR; however, this did not translate into improved ROM. It seems that a single bout of FR may lead to alterations in neural drive. Such alterations potentially <b>enhance</b> <b>strength</b> and performance and delay the onset of fatigue.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well know}} that grain {{boundaries}} <b>enhance</b> <b>strength</b> at low temperatures by acting as obstacles to dislocation motion, and they retard strength at higher temperatures by processes involving grain boundary sliding. The available {{data on the}} influence of grain boundaries on deformation in copper is summarized. Equi-channel angular extrusion offers a convenient means for imposing severe plastic deformation to refine the grain size in bulk materials. Experimental data on fine grained copper produced by equi-channel angular extrusion will be described, and the implications of the data for diffusion creep and superplasticity will be discussed...|$|E

30|$|There is no {{generalised}} trend {{with respect}} to the effect of moisture and temperature on the bonded joint as it depends on a number of factors: such as curing temperature, curing method, adhesive and composite laminate material. Hence, an urgent need to assess and evaluate the behavior of advanced composite laminate and adhesive material under high and low temperature as well under different moisture conditions in order to utilize the full capability of the material for bonded repair joints. Advanced structural adhesives and composite material, could offer opportunities to <b>enhance</b> <b>strength</b> and long-term durability of bonded repairs.|$|E

This qualitative study was carried out in Kenya to explore the situation of these grandparents and to define their current resources and needs. Eight grandparents living in rural village or urban slum caring for their orphaned grandchildren were interviewed. The results showed that these families live under extremely poor conditions lacking food, other vital neccesities and a basic social network.
