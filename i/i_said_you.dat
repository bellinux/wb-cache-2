500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{said that}} [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] was a [...] "supremely catchy pop tune" [...] {{and that the}} video was [...] "the {{perfectly}} blissed-out accompaniment." [...] Montgomery chided the video for [...] "not making much sense" [...] but noted [...] "that hardly matters" [...] as [...] "Kesha has stumbled on a perfect formula for pop success: Don't think too big, or too much. Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, [...] "It's {{a lot harder than}} you'd think to make something seem this effortless. Like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> can accuse Kesha of many things— but don't ever say she's not smart." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] blends {{pulsating}} {{industrial and}} dance beats with elements of trance. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast {{them with the}} hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>You</b> Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated {{in an interview that}} the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.|$|E

500|$|After [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it {{for being}} {{similar to their}} 1979 hit [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>You</b> Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". In a statement, David Bellamy said [...] "professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel {{completely}} ripped off. Where's the originality?" [...] The brothers's attorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that [...] " [...] becomes somewhat uncanny if you simply double {{the beat of the}} Bellamy Brothers' song and match it up with Britney's version" [...] and pointed out that it {{was not the first time}} Martin and Luke were accused of copyright infringement. On March 2, 2011, Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them. The case was dismissed on August 11, 2011. The Bellamy Brothers released a statement that said, [...] "The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the Bellamys' public statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on their website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others." ...|$|E

[...] Mother's Japanese chauffeur asks “I begga pardon – I bringa bags inna house?” that elicits a gong sound and Japanese subtitles. This is followed by Mother’s great Dane barking with the subtitles “I've seen better doghouses than this” with Lisa responding “We're not interested in what the dog says”, and the subtitles disappear. Later, the subtitles ask farmhand Eb if they will be needing any more subtitles for the episode.|$|E
