Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, <b>Global</b> <b>System</b> for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E

5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, <b>Global</b> <b>System</b> for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E
25|$|Longer range {{communications}} {{have been}} proposed using infrastructure networks such as WiMAX (IEEE 802.16), <b>Global</b> <b>System</b> for Mobile Communications (GSM), or 3G. Long-range communications using these methods are well established, but, unlike the short-range protocols, these methods require extensive and very expensive infrastructure deployment.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Global</b> <b>systems</b> – systems {{which may}} operate over {{transient}} networks including mobile elements {{and in which}} computation itself may be mobile – are gaining in importance. Nevertheless, the means for their modelling are still underdeveloped. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is well developed for convenient modelling of behavior, but is not yet so useful for modelling aspects of design relevant to <b>global</b> <b>systems,</b> such as mobility. Non-functional requirements such as performance and security also assume an increased importance {{in the context of}} <b>global</b> <b>systems,</b> and here too, UML requires enhancement. In this paper we present an extension to UML class, sequence and activity diagrams to model mobile systems. We also describe extensions to model performance and security characteristics. We will describe how, wherever possible, we reuse existing work in these areas. ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>global</b> <b>system</b> of indentured laborers was {{abolished}} in 1918, {{although in}} Mauritius, the Immigration Depot still continued operating until 1923. By then, the Great Experiment {{had seen the}} transportation of an estimated two million people throughout the world, with Mauritius welcoming the largest contingent of indentured laborers, reaching {{nearly half a million}} Indian immigrants. In total, 1.2 million Indian migrants were handled by emigration depots worldwide, becoming the global working class of the British Empire. On a larger picture, the migration of indentured laborers is but {{a small portion of the}} Indian diaspora, which has continued through the 20th century to contemporary times. It is estimated that up to 20 million Indians have emigrated from their homeland, making it the largest diaspora in modern times.|$|E
25|$|Rotational {{breaking}} by solar torques {{is another}} process {{likely to have}} occurred early in Mercurian history. With {{the formation of a}} solid lithosphere, stresses induced by tidal despinning most likely were sufficient to cause widespread fracturing. Melosh has shown analytically that the expected pattern of fracturing includes linear strike-slip faults oriented roughly N. 60° W. and N. 60° E., and a younger set of thrust faults with east-west throw and rough north-south trends. Melosh and Dzurisin have pointed out the similarity between this predicted tectonic pattern and that observed on Mercury, and they have proposed that the <b>global</b> <b>system</b> of lineaments and arcuate scarps, which is well developed in the Discovery quadrangle, formed in response to early, simultaneous planetary contraction and tidal despinning.|$|E

25|$|When {{the term}} Internet {{is used to}} refer to the {{specific}} <b>global</b> <b>system</b> of interconnected Internet Protocol (IP) networks, the word is a proper noun that should be written with an initial capital letter. In common use and the media, it is often erroneously not capitalized, viz. the internet. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. The Internet is also {{often referred to as the}} Net, as a short form of network. Historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks.|$|E
25|$|CKVU-TV in Vancouver was {{purchased}} by CanWest Global in 1988, subsequently becoming part of that company's CanWest <b>Global</b> <b>System</b> (renamed the Global Television Network in 1997, {{as part of a}} national expansion of that brand outside what became the new network's Paris, Ontario flagship CIII-TV). However, in 2000, CanWest purchased the television stations of Western International Communications (WIC), which included CHAN-TV in Vancouver and CHEK-TV in Victoria. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) does not allow any single company to own more than two stations serving the same market that broadcast in the same language; as a result, Global had to sell one of the stations. It opted to keep CHAN as that station had much higher ratings than CKVU, as well as a network of rebroadcasters that reach 97% of British Columbia. CKVU was eventually sold to CHUM Limited, and became part of the Citytv television system (now simply known as City, which has since been re-classified as a television network).|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} First Hundred {{are generally}} regarded as living legends. Reports of Hiroko's survival are numerous, and purported sightings occur all over the colonized solar system, but none are substantiated. Nadia and Art Randolph lead a constitutional congress in which a <b>global</b> <b>system</b> of government is established that leaves most cities and settlements generally autonomous, but subject to a central representative legislature and two systems of courts, one legal and the other environmental. The environmental court is packed {{with members of the}} Red faction as a concession (in exchange for their support in the congress, as much of their power was broken when they attempted and failed to violently expel remaining UN forces early on after the second revolution of Green Mars; yet they still retained enough power to stymie constitutional negotiations). Vlad, Marina, and Ursula, the original inventors of the longevity treatments, introduce a new economic system that is a hybrid of capitalism, socialism, and environmental conservationism. During a trip to Earth occurring alongside the congress, Nirgal (one of the original children to be born on Mars to the First Hundred and something of a Mars-wide celebrity), Maya, and Sax negotiate an agreement that allows Earth to send a number of migrants equal to 10% of Mars' population to Mars every year. Following the adoption of the new constitution, Nadia is elected the first president of Mars and serves competently, although she does not enjoy politics. She and Art work together closely, and eventually fall in love and have a child.|$|E
