5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} <b>individual</b> <b>right</b> {{to keep and}} bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the {{enactment}} of the Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|While {{a celebrated}} {{cause for the}} Australian left—{{particular}}ly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement—the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B.A. Santamaria on an anti-communist basis, rather than a pro-Nationalist basis. Equally, although <b>individual</b> <b>right</b> wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least 14 were killed.|$|E

40|$|Amartya Sen's {{paradox of}} the Paretian liberal has been {{generally}} interpreted as reflecting {{a conflict between}} <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> and even the weakest versions of welfarism, and several writers have suggested resolutions of the paradox that give priority to <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> over the Pareto principle. In this paper, {{it is argued that}} there is an inherent tension between <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> and several group rights that have the same intuitive foundation as many <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> It is claimed that a resolution of Sen's paradox, which respects <b>individual</b> <b>rights,</b> will involve giving up values which are libertarian in their origin.

50|$|Group rights, {{also known}} as {{collective}} rights, are rights held by a group qua group rather than by its members severally; in contrast, <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> are <b>rights</b> held by <b>individual</b> people; {{even if they are}} group-differentiated, which most rights are, they remain <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> if the right-holders are the <b>individuals</b> themselves.

40|$|The {{question}} {{that can be}} asked today is: Of what relevance is Rosmini’s legal theory on <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> for modern man? Rosmini’s <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> did not appear from nowhere. From the opinions of some Greek writers, he concluded that the soul, {{as a result of}} its immortal and mobile qualities, is divine in nature and therefore serves as the origin of <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> Rosmini is of the opinion, unlike Thomas Aquinas, that the protection of <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> should filter through to all levels of human existence; from the foetal stage to adult life. In contrast with the Aristotelian Thomistic hylomorphism doctrine, he believes that just like an adult, a foetus has a soul, even in its early stages, and is entitled to the protection of his/her <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> This is the basis of the Constitution of South Africa 108 of 1996. Owing to the innate nature of the human soul, Rosmini succeeded in postulating God as ontological framework for the <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> of man. The description of the unique value of humans in Psalm 8 : 5 is striking: “For thou hast made him but little lower than God, and crownest him with glory and honor. ” (American Standard Version) Man, as image bearer of God, is thus endowed with <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> that must be recognised by all, including the state. Rosmini hereby rejects the salus rei publicae suprema lex doctrine supported by Thomas Aquinas. Rosmini argues that, if this (salus reipublicae suprema lex) doctrine were to be followed, the state would be encroaching on the <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> of its citizens. Furthermore, he believes that the state is geared to protect the <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> of its citizens. Rosmini thus argues that the interests of the state are best served if the interests of the citizen are first protected. </p...|$|R

As {{a matter of the}} right to privacy and of gender equality, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} an {{education}} is found in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of ICESCR. The Constitution of Tokelau gives no indication {{to the meaning of}} each <b>individual</b> <b>right,</b> therefore ICESCR can be used to define what the right to education actually means. ICESCR goes into some detail of what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should be free and compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on to say there needs to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality.|$|E

However, the ACLU opposes any effort to create a registry of gun owners and has worked with the National Rifle Association to prevent a registry from being created, and it has favored protecting the right to carry guns under the 4th Amendment.|$|E

500|$|In {{light of}} the Supreme Court's Heller {{decision}} recognizing that the Constitution protects an <b>individual</b> <b>right</b> to bear arms, ACLU of Nevada took a position of supporting [...] "the individual's {{right to bear arms}} subject to constitutionally permissible regulations" [...] and pledged to [...] "defend this right as it defends other constitutional rights".

50|$|In the minarchist {{political}} views of classical liberals and some right-libertarians, {{the role of}} the government is solely to identify, protect, and enforce the natural <b>rights</b> of the <b>individual</b> while attempting to assure just remedies for transgressions.

40|$|As American Indian nations revitalize {{their legal}} systems, there is renewed {{interest}} in 2 ̆ 2 tribal law, 2 ̆ 2 that is, the law {{of each of the}} Indian nations. Today, there is a particular focus on the subject of 2 ̆ 2 <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> 2 ̆ 2 under tribal law. In tribal contexts, people are highly interested in the legal institutions and rules that govern their lives, especially as many tribal communities are experiencing a period of great political, social, and economic change. At the national level, the Supreme Court repeatedly expresses concern about whether individuals, especially non-Indians, will be treated fairly in tribal court. For scholars, <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> under tribal law raises a number of issues including potential tension between <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> and the collective interests and cultures of Indian tribes, the expectation of reservation residents that the law will protect their <b>individual</b> <b>rights,</b> and the meaning of tribal sovereignty in the contemporary era. For those outside the Indian law field, the question of American Indians 2 ̆ 7 <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> in tribal settings seems to inspire reflection on the broader question of <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> under law. This Article enters the discussion about <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> under tribal law by considering the specific area of individual religious freedoms. It explores, in the religious freedoms context, an emerging scholarly consensus that the presence of <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> in tribal settings represents the assimilation of tribal law, institutions, and peoples. By examining historical and contemporary sources on individual freedoms under tribal law, the article concedes that the scholarly critiques offer important cautions. It argues, however, that tribes may be able to implement constitutional provisions on individual religious freedoms in ways that enhance tribal communities and advance sovereignty...|$|R
500|$|Bearing in mind these restraints, the court's only {{task is to}} {{ascertain}} whether an impugned law is within the purview {{of any of the}} permissible restrictions. Hence, all that needs to be established is a nexus between the object of the law in question and one of the permissible subjects stipulated in Article 14(2).

500|$|Arguing for respondents, Thomas Goldstein {{distinguished}} between political neutrality and political apathy.

As Heffernan claimed {{that he had no}} affiliation with Spagnola, the respondents argued that Heffernan's actions constitute unprotected apathy rather than a conscious choice of neutrality. Justice Elena Kagan questioned Goldstein as to the purpose of the First Amendment saying, [...] "the idea has to do with why the government acted" [...] to which he responded, [...] "It's called an <b>individual</b> <b>right,</b> not a government wrong." [...] Frost took a rebuttal to respond to Goldstein's distinction between political neutrality and apathy, arguing that there is little distinction as the government is acting for impermissible reasons in both cases.|$|E
