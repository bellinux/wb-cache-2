She is invited to take an open desk, and she takes Andy's manager <b>desk,</b> <b>as</b> he is absent. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) says she cannot take Andy's job, but Robert is {{interested}} in her spontaneous behavior. As acting manager, Nellie decides to give everyone performance reviews. Both Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) refuse to let her proceed, as she is unfamiliar with the other employees. To counter this, Nellie offers Dwight a raise on the spot, and eventually, he and the other employees relent, except for Jim. When it is Jim's turn, Jim still refuses. Everyone in the office, except for Jim and his wife, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), applaud her. Nellie promptly begins rearranging the office.|$|E

25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading <b>desk</b> <b>as</b> counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E

25|$|On 21 February 2007 it was {{reported}} that thirteen Adam Air employees, as well as an employee of airport operator PT Angkasa Pura, working at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport had been arrested for fraudulent data manipulation. The scheme involved manipulating passenger data to show passengers as 'leaving the country'. This meant that they were automatically charged a duty of 30,000 Rupiah each, when in reality they owed none. The money was then split between fourteen staff members. A computer from the check-in <b>desk,</b> <b>as</b> well as passenger tickets and lists, were seized.|$|E

25|$|With his {{activity}} in academia, Rainer reacted against cronyism, taking a public stand against arbitrary appointments in teaching, and ruining {{his relationship with}} the establishment. At a time when the Romanian school of anthropology was being divided between centrists and supporters of the fascist Iron Guard, he was again confronted by the far-right. Rainer was opposed to the fascist youth, whose members instigated in favor of academic censorship in his university curriculum. At one such incident in early 1938, Rainer stood unmoved at his <b>desk</b> <b>as</b> some of his fascist students, including the son of painter Nicolae Tonitza, lit firecrackers and threw eggs in his direction. However, he refused to ask for sanctions against them, and eventually received their letter of apology.|$|E
25|$|On September 15, 2012, WPVI-TV {{took over}} {{production}} of MyNetworkTV affiliate WPHL-TV (channel 17)'s 10 p.m. newscast from NBC-owned WCAU (which began producing the 10 p.m. newscast in December 2005, after WPHL shut down its own in-house news department). The newscast, Action News at 10pm on PHL 17, respectively utilizes {{most of the}} same anchors as WPVI's weekday 4 p.m. and weekend evening newscasts with a few noticeable differences. Features anchor Alicia Vitarelli does not appear on the weeknight broadcasts, while Sports Director Ducis Rogers and weekend sports anchor Jeff Skversky join their respective anchor teams. Meteorologist Melissa Magee replaces Adam Joseph for the weekend editions. Additionally, while weeknight anchors Brian Taff and Sharrie Williams operate from the same desk used for the 4 p.m. broadcast, weekend anchors Walter Perez and Sarah Bloomquist (who also anchors the Noon edition alongside Rick Williams) operate from the main <b>desk</b> <b>as</b> they carry over to anchor 11 p.m.-midnight on WPVI. Bloomquist only anchors with Perez on the Sunday edition of the newscast. With this, WPVI became the third ABC owned-and-operated station {{to be involved in}} a news share agreement, after KGO-TV in San Francisco (which produces a 9 p.m. newscast for independent station KOFY-TV) and WTVD in Raleigh (which produces a 10 p.m. newscast for CW affiliate WLFL), and was later joined in 2014 by KABC-TV in Los Angeles (which produces a 7 p.m. newscast for independent station KDOC-TV). On September 15, 2014, the newscast was expanded to a full hour-long broadcast, making WPHL the second station in the Philadelphia area (along with competitor WTXF) to carry an hour-long newscast at 10 p.m. Only competitor WPSG carries a 1/2 hour long newscast, Eyewitness News at 10 on The CW Philly (operated by sister station KYW).|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Washington's death, Nelson (who is white) painted Mirth & Girth, a [...] "full-length frontal {{portrait}} of a portly grim-faced Harold Washington clad in a white bra and G-string, garter belt, and stockings". The painting was approximately [...] tall by [...] wide. In the portrait, Washington is holding a pencil in his right hand. His aide, Alton Miller, initially mistook Washington's slumping over his <b>desk</b> <b>as</b> an attempt {{to pick up a}} pencil that had fallen onto the floor. The title of the piece is presumably derived from Girth & Mirth, an organization for overweight gay men.|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his <b>desk</b> <b>as</b> if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E

500|$|In 1870 Hiram Revels {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate by the reconstructed Mississippi Legislature. [...] Revels was the first African American elected to the Senate, and Senate Democrats {{attempted}} to prevent him from being seated. [...] Wilson defended Revels's election, and presented as evidence of its validity signatures from the clerks of the Mississippi House of Representatives and Mississippi State Senate, {{as well as that of}} Adelbert Ames, the military Governor of Mississippi. [...] Wilson argued that Revels's skin color was not a bar to Senate service, and connected the role of the Senate to Christianity's Golden Rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself. [...] The Senate voted to seat Revels, and after he took the oath of office Wilson personally escorted him to his <b>desk</b> <b>as</b> journalists recorded the historic event.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme is also {{revealed}} to be power-crazed in other ways. Michiko Kakutani writes [...] "Francia, it seems, wants to account for everything (his own history, {{as well as the}} history of his nation, which he personifies as its leader) as he pours out his story, it becomes clear that he possesses an insatiable desire for power and controlâhe has even chained a huge meteorite to his <b>desk,</b> <b>as</b> punishment for being a cosmic runawayâand that he also sees himself as two separate beings: as a conniving, paranoiac [...] "I", beset by the average ego's fears and doubts, and as the [...] "Supreme", a monstrously powerful presence that even Francia himself must refer to in the third person." [...] The Supreme was personally involved in the affairs of the state to such extent, that it was reported by contemporary press that [...] " [...] personally trained his cavalry {{in the use of the}} saber, ascertained the exact number of nails in Fort Orange, awarded 102 pesos to a Frenchman whose anchor had been melted down by the state... lowered the price of salt in the capital, donated state yerba to the people of Saladillo, and denied permission for [...] to marry in Villa Rica." [...] It was common for him to attend to such specific details in a single evening.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be calm as she wants to get a closer look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a <b>desk.</b> <b>As</b> the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E
