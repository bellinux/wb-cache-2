The reason is when the person does not feel that they can sustain goodness and it is safer for it to be put into the object. This is the basis for idealisation, and it can be useful in certain situations, e.g. idealising a surgeon who is operating.|$|R

In the fall of 1963, Expo's general manager, Andrew Kniewasser, presented the master plan and the preliminary budget of $167 million for construction: it would balloon to over $439 million by 1967.

After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony.

Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why,</b> as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I thought... I was going to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out."

This paper provides foundations for the assumption that renegotiating a delegation contract can be costly by illustrating how political institutions can generate inertia in recontracting, reduce the gains from it or prevent it altogether. Once the nature of renegotiation costs has been clarified, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> certain institutions can mitigate or solve dynamic inconsistencies better than others.

It would be an unwise act to record illegal behavior, especially in New York where the Northern Democrats were strong.

Concerning the committee's results The Economist reported in January 2008: [...] "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried.

[...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as [...] "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way" [...] and [...] "a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more." [...] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, [...] "There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that a city like Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum. How else could Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number, at a railroad station, over the closing credits? You can either chide the film, at this point, for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flow—surely the wiser choice." [...] Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise, saying the film [...] "successfully mixes hard-hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around". Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style [...] "masala" [...] movie, due to the way the film combines [...] "familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala" [...] and culminates in [...] "the romantic leads finding each other." ...|$|E

[...] Strauss writes that with Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys became the first major rock group [...] "to look music trends firmly in the eye and declare that rock really didn't matter. Rock is supposed to be about, you know, fucking, and Brian Wilson was recording a song ('I Know There's an Answer') that was originally entitled 'Get Rid of Your Libido'." [...] Sommer said that the Beach Boys became the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format: [...] "Of course, others had done it for a song or two, but no one had said, 'This will be a complete album that can not be performed by four or five guys plugged into amps....

60|$|We {{have seen}} that {{in all parts of}} the world persons who feel shame for some moral delinquency, are apt to avert, bend down, or hide their faces, {{independently}} of any thought about their personal appearance. The object can hardly be to conceal their blushes, for the face is thus averted or hidden under circumstances which exclude any desire to conceal shame, as when guilt is fully confessed and repented of. It is, however, probable that primeval man before he had acquired much moral sensitiveness would have been highly sensitive about his personal appearance, at least in reference to the other sex, and he would consequently have felt distress at any depreciatory remarks about his appearance; and this is one form of shame. And as the face is the part of the body which is most regarded, it is intelligible that any one ashamed of his personal appearance would desire to conceal this part of his body. The habit having been thus acquired, would naturally be carried on when shame from strictly moral causes was felt; and it is not <b>easy</b> otherwise <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> under these circumstances there should be a desire to hide the face more than any other part of the body.|$|R
40|$|Defending the Baltic States militarily after 1918 was not {{an option}} for British governments {{burdened}} by commitments to Imperial defence, and with only a skeletal British Expeditionary Force available to meet new European obligations incurred by the Treaty of Locarno. London saw stability and economic prosperity in the Baltic region as a whole as the real key to lasting independence for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. To this goal Britain made a vital contribution after 1918, as a recipient of Baltic agricultural and other exports, thus facilitating Baltic purchases of manufactured products from Germany. When the British-Baltic-German trade ‘triangle’ was destroyed by Hitler’s arrival in power, the British government then used trade policy to try to limit the impact of the Third Reich in the Baltic region. Viewing the interwar period as a whole, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> both <b>why</b> Britain ultimately chose to resist Hitler over Baltic issues and why London was so reluctant to allow Stalin a free hand in the Baltic States during the Moscow negotiations of 1939.
