500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

60|$|It {{is a sad}} and gloomy {{thing to}} travel even from Italy into France. But it is a joyful thing to walk south to Italy, south and west. It is so. And {{there is a certain}} exaltation in the thought of going west, even to Cornwall, to Ireland. It is as if the {{magnetic}} poles were south-west and north-east, for our spirits, with the south-west, under the sunset, as the positive pole. So whilst <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> Switzerland, though it is a valley of gloom and depression, a light seems to flash out under every footstep, with the joy of progression.|$|E

Now, if you will promise to wait beside the horse while <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our whereabouts, I'll deposit you here willingly.

I say to myself, which of these things can you do? Not one. I can make a bow or an arrow, catch fish, kill game, and go to war; but none of these things is of any use here. To learn what is done here would require a long time. Old age comes on. I should be a useless piece of furniture, useless to my nation, useless to myself. I must go back to my own country." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now was Christian much {{affected}} {{with his}} deliverance {{from all the}} dangers of his solitary way; which dangers, though he feared them more before, yet he saw them more clearly now, because {{the light of the}} day made them conspicuous to him. And about this time the sun was rising, and this was another mercy to Christian; for you must note, that though {{the first part of the}} Valley of the Shadow of Death was dangerous, yet this second part which he was yet to go, was, if possible, far more dangerous:[102] for from the place where he now stood, even to the end of the valley, the way was all along set so full of snares, traps, gins, and nets here, and so full of pits, pitfalls, deep holes, and shelvings down there, that had it now been dark, as it were when he came the first part of the way, had he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been cast away;[103] but, as I said, just now the sun was rising. Then said he, [...] "His candle shineth upon my head, and by His light <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> darkness" [...] (Job 29:3).|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> these fine gardens, said he, I {{have only}} to fancy myself the owner of them, and they are mine. All these gay crowds are my visitors, and I defy the grand seignior himself to display {{a greater variety of}} beauty. Nay, what is better, I have not the trouble of {{entertaining}} them. My estate is a perfect Sans Souci, where every one does as he pleases, and no one troubles the owner. All Paris is my theater, and presents me with a continual spectacle. I have a table spread for me in every street, and thousands of waiters ready to fly at my bidding. When my servants have waited upon me I pay them, discharge them, and there's an end; I have no fears of their wronging or pilfering me when my back is turned. Upon the whole, said the old gentleman with a smile of infinite good humor, when I think upon the various risks I have run, {{and the manner in which}} I have escaped them; when I recollect all that I have suffered, and consider all that I at present enjoy, I cannot but look upon myself as a man of singular good fortune.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was as if}} He had said, [...] "However short my day of {{life may}} be, there are twelve hours in it, of my Father's {{numbering}} and measuring, not of mine. My times are in His hand, as long as He pleases I shall live. He {{has given me a}} work to do, and He will see that I live long enough to do it. Into His hands I commend my spirit, for, living or dying, He is with me. Though <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the valley of the shadow of death, He will be with me. He will keep me secretly in His tabernacle from the strife of tongues, and will turn the furiousness of my enemies to His glory; and as my day my strength will be. And I have no fear of running into danger needlessly. I have prayed to Him daily and nightly for light, for His Spirit--the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of prudence and courage; and His word is pledged to keep me in all my ways, so that I dash not my foot against a stone. Know ye not that I must be about my Father's business? While I am about that I am safe. It is only if I go about my own business--my own pleasure; if I forget to ask Him for His light and guidance, that I shall put myself into the night, and stumble and fall." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{very much}} {{questioned}} within myself, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the Insane Asylum, whether I {{should have known}} the attendants from the patients, but for the few words which passed between the former, and the Doctor, {{in reference to the}} persons under their charge.
