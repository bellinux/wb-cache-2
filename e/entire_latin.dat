In July 1261, Alexios Strategopoulos, a general of Nicaea, was sent {{with a small}} advance force of 800 soldiers, most of them Cumans, to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins. When the Byzantine force reached the village of Selymbria, they learned from independent local farmers (thelematarioi) that the <b>entire</b> <b>Latin</b> garrison, and the Venetian fleet, were absent conducting a raid against the Nicaean island of Daphnousia.

It is estimated that, for the last year, levels of excess reserves are equivalent to between US$ 170 - 200 billions.

This criticism was influenced by the coverage put out by media outlets in Communist-controlled countries, but was repeated in the media in countries that were US allies, with Britain's Labour party and the Swedish Social Democratic Party joining in.

[...] Although people within the US saw the coup as a triumph for US foreign policy, CIA officials felt that in order for Operation PBSUCCESS to be termed a success, further action was needed.

Men with higher social support and a higher income reported significantly higher mental health. When stratified by gender, data show that for men physical health was only positively associated with younger age. For women, in addition to age, social support and marital status were significantly related. Both men and women with higher social support and income had significantly better mental health. Finally, for immigrants, the physical and mental health components of health-related quality of life were not found to be significantly associated with any of the pre-migration factors or conditions of migration. Only the variable "exposure to political violence" was significantly associated with the mental health component (p = 0. 014). The key factors to understanding HRQoL among Latin American-born immigrants settled in Spain are age, sex and social support. Therefore, strategies to maintain optimal health outcomes in these immigrant communities should include public policies on social inclusion in the host society and focus on improving social support networks in order to foster and maintain the health and HRQoL of this group...|$|R
