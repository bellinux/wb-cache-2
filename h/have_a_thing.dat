500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kevin O'Sullivan {{from the}} Daily Mirror called the affair storyline [...] "dreadful", [...] "painfully unoriginal", [...] "ludicrous tosh" [...] and [...] "far fetched", saying, [...] "A tired old rerun of 2010's who-got-Heather-pregnant nailbiter, the who-copped-off-with-Kat saga {{was about as}} {{believable}} as a Barclays banker." [...] Ally Ross from The Sun said that [...] "someone has been slipping angel dust in the Queen Vic beer and half the Square have lost their friggin' minds [...] all the men now fancy Ting Tong (Kat Moon)", while Julie Emery from Heat said, [...] "Now don't get us wrong, we love Kat Moon. [...] But we're finding {{it hard to believe}} that she has five (five!) blokes thinking she's sex-on-legs and lusting after her Tango'd torso. Perhaps Michael, Ray, Jack, Max and Derek all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> about too-tight Lycra pencil skirts and make-up that looks like it's been applied by a five year old on acid." [...] Sarah Dempster from The Guardian dubbed the storyline [...] "Who Banged Kat?", [...] "a question to which the only sane response is 'Pass us the remote, love. [...] is on Five.'" [...] She said [...] "Nobody cares" [...] about the [...] "tedious" [...] storyline, adding that the reveal would cause [...] "yawns of non-surprise" [...] from the viewers. Following the final reveal, Ellie Henman from Heat said it had been [...] "possibly one of the most gripping since who shot Phil" [...] and that the reveal was [...] "some seriously head in hands, sweaty palms, accidentally kick your dog because the moment is just too intense viewing".|$|E
