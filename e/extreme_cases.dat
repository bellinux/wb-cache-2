40|$|The {{following}} thesis analyses {{the form}} and importance of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> formulations based on more than 10 research interviews. <b>Extreme</b> <b>case</b> formulations, i. e. formulations comprising expressions such as "nothing", "everything" or "noone", which present a phenomenon or a circumstance according to its minimal or maximal properties, can constitute a complication {{in the analysis of}} research interviews. This thesis expand the existing hypothesis of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> formulations by adding new findings, for example the bipolarity of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> formulations. In the analysed data, these do often occur together with different clasifiers, which either weaken (softeners) or strengthen (intensifiers) their extreme force. At the same time the following thesis broadens the research of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> formulations of interdisciplinary approach, which uses the findings from psychology and rhetoric. The conducted research is furthermore completed with the acoustic analysis of semantically extreme formulations, whose results show that <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> formulations often tend to be acoustically emphasized.

40|$|Abstract Background Estimates of {{variance}} components for binary responses in presence of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems {{tend to be}} biased due to an under-identified likelihood. The bias persists even when a normal prior {{is used for the}} fixed effects. Methods A simulation study was carried out to investigate methods for the analysis of binary responses with <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems. A linear mixed model that included a fixed effect and random effects of sire and residual on the liability scale was used to generate binary data. Five simulation scenarios were conducted based on varying percentages of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems, with true values of heritability equal to 0. 07 and 0. 17. Five replicates of each dataset were generated and analyzed with a generalized prior (g-prior) of varying weight. Results Point estimates of sire variance using a normal prior were severely biased when the percentage of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems was greater than 30 %. Depending on the percentage of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems, the sire variance was overestimated when a normal prior was used by 36 to 102 % and 25 to 105 % for a heritability of 0. 17 and 0. 07, respectively. When a g-prior was used, the bias was reduced and even eliminated, depending on the percentage of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems and the weight assigned to the g-prior. The lowest Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were obtained when a normal prior was used. When a 15 % g-prior was used instead of a normal prior with a heritability equal to 0. 17, Pearson correlations between true and fixed effects increased by 11, 20, 23, 27, and 60 % for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 75 % of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems, respectively. Conversely, Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were similar, within datasets of varying percentages of <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems, when a 5, 10, or 15 % g-prior was included. Therefore this indicates that a model with a g-prior provides a more adequate estimation of fixed effects. Conclusions The results suggest that when analyzing binary data with <b>extreme</b> <b>case</b> problems, bias in the estimation {{of variance}} components could be eliminated, or at least significantly reduced by using a g-prior. </p...|$|R

5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position.

What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some <b>extreme</b> <b>cases</b> of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most <b>extreme</b> <b>cases,</b> ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in <b>extreme</b> <b>cases,</b> burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in <b>extreme</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and in <b>extreme</b> <b>cases</b> this {{can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In <b>extreme</b> <b>cases,</b> elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E
5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in <b>extreme</b> <b>cases</b> these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. <b>Extreme</b> <b>cases</b> of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In <b>extreme</b> <b>cases,</b> they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
