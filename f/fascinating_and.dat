The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of the}} chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E

25|$|In small circles Kohl was <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> {{a perfect}} host; {{the larger the}} crowd, the vaguer, weaker and paler he appeared. His gaze into TV cameras made him look helpless.

Additionally, the catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was simply no intellectual - to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg) he just felt foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.|$|E

However, the album reached number one on the Italian album charts.|$|E
500|$|Other critics concurred {{that the}} film had artistic merit. [...] "atching Moore's noir tale is like being super-glued to your seat while getting poked in the eye," [...] Chalat-Noaker wrote. [...] "It's both <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> repelling." [...] Stephen Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "one of the strangest and most provocative movies this {{reporter}} has seen in eight years attending the Sundance Film Festival". At Indiewire, Eric Kohn wrote that [...] "Moore portrays Disney World as the ultimate horror show [...] and gets the point across in nearly every scene".|$|E

500|$|Bloggers Joey Guerra (AfterElton) and Jay Cheel (The Documentary Blog) found Gabbie, Raci, Lucas, and T.J. <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> {{their stories}} engrossing. Guerra called the show [...] "addictive… {{not only because}} of sharp {{storytelling}} but because of the students' fully realized personalities." [...] Cheel described the students as [...] "intelligent, articulate and passionate in everything they do". Similarly, on DVD Talk, David Cornelius gushed with praise. He was impressed by {{the ways in which the}} series interwove stories, and presented some themes as a study in contrasts: Gabbie's economic privilege compared with Raci's financial struggles; Lucas and T.J.'s struggle for rights and recognition.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the American {{broadcast}} of Jesus: The Complete Story were also mixed. While some reviewers described {{the show as}} <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> reverent, others were more negative. Writing for The Orlando Sentinel, Hal Boedeker agreed that the computer imaging was spectacular, but {{that the rest of}} the show was a [...] "hodgepodge" [...] that [...] " [...] off on some strange tangents". Eric Mink of The Daily News stated that the show relied too heavily on exaggeration and that it was [...] "sloppy with facts", while Ann Rodgers-Melnick of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described it as [...] "uneven but vivid".|$|E

500|$|With {{subsequent}} episodes, reviews improved. The Boston Globe, comparing {{its debut}} episode ("a gloppy nostalgia trip that presented history the way MTV presents rock, in digestible, unrelated, bland bite-sized bits") to an episode airing {{less than five}} months later, found it [...] "light years ahead in terms of wit, style and historical perspective. It is still easily digestible, but there's nothing bland about it." [...] The St. Petersburg Times said of the show, [...] "It educated, {{but it was not}} school. It entertained, but it was not mindless. It was quality - television's noblest service." [...] The San Diego Union concurred, citing Our World as [...] "the most refreshing, <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> innovative history series ever on TV".|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson {{questioned}} whether the writers had been using drugs lately because of the surge of drug-related episodes; though he loved it, he acknowledged that the episode was one [...] "you are either going to love or hate", explaining that it [...] "got a little crazy using Olivia’s mind as a setting, [...] it stays grounded through the emotional current running underneath... {{you have to give}} Fringe credit for taking a risky, bold move." [...] SFScope writer Sarah Stegall called the episode [...] "brilliant, risky, <b>fascinating,</b> <b>and</b> dangerous. It's not a tack this show can afford to take very often, but I like it when it does." ...|$|E
500|$|The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday {{rated the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, writing: [...] "Saving Mr. Banks doesn't always {{straddle}} its stories and time periods with the utmost grace. But the film— which John Lee Hancock directed from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith— more than makes up for its occasionally unwieldy structure in telling a <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> ultimately deeply affecting story, along the way giving viewers tantalizing glimpses of the beloved 1964 movie musical, in both its creation and final form." [...] The New York Times A. O. Scott gave a positive review, declaring the film as [...] "an embellished, tidied-up but nonetheless reasonably authentic glimpse of the Disney entertainment machine at work." ...|$|E

500|$|Hepburn {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her {{on-screen}} persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, [...] "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality." [...] Playwright and author David Macaray has said, [...] "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> unique woman with a superior actress." [...] Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.|$|E
500|$|The BBC review stated fans {{hoping for}} [...] "a fresh suite of crisp new Sparks songs" [...] might be {{disappointed}} because [...] "there are no tunes without the tale attached", {{but added that}} [...] "luckily, the tale is a good one": the story of Hollywood corruption [...] "is told masterfully, and builds to a dramatic conclusion that both condemns Hollywood and satirises its conventions with rapier-sharp wit." [...] Dave Simpson in The Guardian said the piece, [...] "best experienced as a whole", was [...] "not an idle fantasy, and emerges as a <b>fascinating</b> <b>and</b> powerful discourse on the struggle between art and commerce, and the destructive power of celebrity", calling the musical [...] "a bold, major work – as compelling and original as anything in their sporadically brilliant career." ...|$|E
