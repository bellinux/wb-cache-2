2500|$|While {{constitutional}} law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and {{member states to}} follow the law. Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or [...] "standing" [...] (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to {{not be allowed to}} bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on [...] "direct effect" [...] limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.|$|E

50|$|On the {{question}} of preference between sources of international law, rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, is cogens (peremptory norm) is a custom, not a treaty. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas {{it is unclear whether}} the <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law.
