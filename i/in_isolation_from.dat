5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when reared <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>from</b> when {{reared in}} a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely}} to leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>from</b> the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>from</b> friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but usually only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E

5|$|The popular view of Richard {{has more}} than {{anything}} been influenced by Shakespeare's play about the king, Richard II. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power. Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions. Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham. Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until Henry VII's accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was {{to blame for the}} later-15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>from</b> the reign of Richard II.|$|E

40|$|Oxoid Salmonella Chromogenic Medium (OSCM) {{was tested}} for its {{sensitivity}} and specificity {{as well as its}} use <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> of Salmonella <b>from</b> stool specimens and from porcine faeces. Colonies of Salmonella enterica ssp. I, II, IV, and VI-strains grow onto the ivory-coloured turbid plates purple to mauve, size 1 - 2 mm in diameter. Contrarily, E. coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., S. sonnei and the most of C. freundii strains appear as turquoise to blue colonies. Proteus spp., Providencia spp. and Morganella morganii grow light with brownish precipitation. S. dysenteriae, S. jlexneri and S. boydii are widely inhibited. Pseudomonads, Aeromonas spp., grampositive bacteria and C. albicans are completely inhibited. Its recovery rate and sensitivity <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> of salmonella <b>from</b> stool specimens is comparable to Hektoen Enteric agar.

25|$|The first {{humans to}} settle here were the Cahuilla people, 2,000 years ago.

While Palm Canyon was occupied during winter months, they often moved to cooler Chino Canyon during the summer months.|$|E

25|$|The {{new century}} has brought new {{dynamics}} {{to the practice}} of visual performance. To be a VJ previously had largely meant a process of self-invention <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>from</b> others: the term was not widely known. Then through the rise of internet adoption, having access to other practitioners very became the norm, and virtual communities quickly formed. The sense of collective then translated from the virtual world onto physical spaces. This becomes apparent through the numerous festivals that emerge all over Europe with strong focus on VJing.|$|E
25|$|Later {{interpretations of}} Avicenna's {{philosophy}} split into three different schools; those (such as al-Tusi) {{who continued to}} apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as al-Razi) who considered Avicenna's theological works <b>in</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>from</b> his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as al-Ghazali) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights {{through a variety of}} mystical means. It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the madrasahs.|$|E
