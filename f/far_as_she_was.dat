2500|$|Oliver {{had finally}} {{told her that}} he wasn't a real count, but she didn't care (it was clear she never cared about him) and thusly didn't believe her husband's words, believing that he had been called [...] "Count" [...] in Paris, that MADE him the Count, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> concerned.|$|E

"As {{the blessed}} Virgin Mary {{does not seem}} to {{participate}} in the public life of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, she is not there without divine intention. She suffers with her suffering and dying son, almost as if she would have died herself. For the salvation of mankind, she gave up her rights as the mother of her son and sacrificed him for the reconciliation of divine justice, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> permitted to do. Therefore, one can say, she redeemed with Christ the human race." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "You Give Good Love" [...] brought Houston {{a bit of}} notoriety when {{it turned}} up among several songs cited by advice {{columnist}} Ann Landers as having suggestive titles. Landers, in her column for a reader who worried about the bad influence of song lyrics on children, wrote that [...] "Some of the lyrics are sexually provocative. The titles tell the story," [...] and called the song [...] "pretty trashy stuff", citing the song's title as an instance along with [...] "Hot Love" [...] by Cheap Trick, [...] "Let's Go to Bed" [...] by The Cure, [...] "Ready, Willing and Able" [...] by Lita Ford, [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] and [...] "Love at First Feel" [...] by AC/DC, [...] "Tease Me" [...] by Junie Morrison, and [...] "Fire Down Below" [...] by Bob Seger. Houston, {{in an interview with}} Chicago Tribune, gave some answers to Landers' comments, saying [...] "She chose a few songs out of the Top 40 that she thought had suggestive titles as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> concerned, {{and it was one of}} them. I don't think that the title is suggestive at all. It didn't say anything but 'you give good love,' and it didn't say anything in the song that was sexual or outrageous. I think that Miss Landers just looked at the title and didn't view the song itself." [...] Houston, who described herself as a religious person, said that she hasn't given much thought to the controversy over questionable lyrics: ...|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Russian court {{was one of the}} most splendid in all Europe. Foreigners were amazed at the sheer luxury of the sumptuous balls and masquerades. The Russian court had {{steadily}} increased in importance throughout the 18th century and came to hold more cultural significance than many of its Western counterparts due its inclusive nature; any “well to do inhabitants” were welcome at Court. The Court, like most Imperial Courts, was considered a reflection of the ruler at its center and Elizabeth was said to be “the laziest, most extravagant and most amorous of sovereigns.” Elizabeth was intelligent but lacked the discipline and early education necessary to flourish as an intellectual; she found the reading of secular literature to be “injurious to health.” [...] She was kind and warm-hearted for the emotion's sake alone, once going so far as to offer to finance the reconstruction of Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake destroyed the Portuguese city despite having and wanting no diplomatic relationship with the nation. She hated bloodshed and conflict and went to great lengths to alter the Russian system of punishment, even outlawing capital punishment. Even in court this peacemaker spirit made itself evident. According to historian Robert Nisbet Bain, it was one of Elizabeth’s “chief glories that, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able, she put a stop to that mischievous contention of rival ambitions at Court, which had disgraced the reigns of Peter II, Anne and Ivan VI, and enabled foreign powers to freely interfere in the domestic affairs of Russia.” [...] She was also deeply religious, passing several pieces of legislation that undid much of the work her father had done to limit the power of the church. Yet of all her various characteristics manifested in the structure of Court life the most evident were her extravagance, her vanity, and her gaiety and playful nature.|$|E

50|$|Mary herself fears New York City so {{much that}} she sticks to staying in the flat, rarely daring to go outside. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> concerned, her beloved son's only vice is his smoking, which she keeps trying to discourage.|$|R
6000|$|J. M.—It is {{too soon}} to settle what to think. But, looking to [...] Irish interests, I think a Parnellite Ireland {{infinitely}} better [...] than a divided Ireland. Anything better than an Ireland divided, [...] so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> concerned.|$|R

50|$|In the Heavenly Faith {{school of}} thought, the Holy Spirit {{is synonymous with}} Sophia, being the {{feminine}} counterpart to the masculine Logos.

60|$|By these tidings Hannah was {{of course}} prostrated, and driven {{into a state of}} {{excitement}} that was not without its pleasantness as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> concerned.

60|$|I {{saw that}} Mrs. Wilbur was chagrined and angry, {{for a hot}} flush had dyed her cheeks, when she replied that of course Mr. Sanderson could do as he chose.

60|$|In {{the drama}} of which she was the self-appointed stage-director, Kirk was a mere super {{supporting}} the infant star.

60|$|As to the tomfoolery down at Brandon's, {{which ended}} in Erskine and myself marrying the young lady {{visitors}} there, I can only congratulate you on the determination with which you have striven to make something like a romance out of such very thin material.
