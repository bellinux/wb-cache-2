50|$|The 2009 Vuelta {{has been}} {{described}} as having an easy start and a <b>hard</b> <b>finish.</b> This is because of the short individual time trial and three perfectly flat stages in the Netherlands (along with another in Spain in the race's first week), and eight of the final fourteen stages being mountain stages, with four mountaintop finishes.|$|R

50|$|Items {{continued}} to be manufactured during the 19th century usually influenced by 18th century examples. There was a definite resurgence in items being made during the 1920s and 1930s, the lean <b>hard</b> <b>finish</b> and traditional pale green tone lent itself very well to the prevailing art-deco style. Many of these items are designed along modernist lines with little 18th century influence. A broad range of items date from this period including furniture and luggage.|$|R

5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{opinion from}} someone who does the job: The tar, or [...] "slush" [...] {{is a mixture of}} Stockholm tar, boiled linseed oil, and Japan drier. Many [...] "recipes" [...] for slush exist, but the intent is always to allow a penetrating coat of preservative pine tar that then cures to a <b>harder</b> <b>finish</b> that will not so easily rub off on sails and crew. The term [...] "slush" [...] is also used to describe the grease applied to the masts to lubricate the parrels so that the yards can raise and lower freely.|$|R
50|$|After impressing in 2003-2004 {{pre-season}} friendlies, Harding {{spent the}} first half of the season on the substitutes' bench with seven appearances. Soon after the appointment of manager Mark McGhee, Harding was selected to make his full debut against Bournemouth on 21 February 2004 following the suspension of Kerry Mayo. The game ended in a 3-0 win for Bournemouth. Harding remained in the starting eleven for the reminder of the 2003-04 season and helped the club gain promotion to the Championship after beating Bristol City 1-0 in the play-off final in Cardiff. <b>Harding</b> <b>finished</b> the season making twenty-three appearances.|$|R
50|$|Used when a fast-curing, tough, <b>hard</b> <b>finish</b> is desired, such as for kitchen {{cabinets}} and office furniture. Comes in two parts: a resin and an acid catalyst. The {{first is a}} blend of an amino resin and an alkyd. The acid catalyst is added right before application in a set ratio determined by the manufacturer. Most produce minimal yellowing. There are, however, two downsides to this finish. The first is that as the finish cures, it gives off formaldehyde, which is toxic and carcinogenic. The second is that the finish can crack or craze if too many coats are applied.|$|R
50|$|To produce prints, {{the plate}} is {{dampened}} with a glycerine/water mixture which is slightly acidic, then blotted before inking with collotype ink using a leather or velvet roller. A <b>hard</b> <b>finished</b> paper such as Bristol is then put {{on top of}} the plate and covered with a tympan before being printed typically using a hand proof press. Collotypes are printed using less pressure than is used in printing intaglio or stone lithography. While it is possible to print by hand using a roller or brayer, an acceptable consistency of pressure and even distribution of ink is most effectively achieved using a press.|$|R
5000|$|Harding {{made his}} Southampton {{debut in the}} opening {{game of the season}} at left-back in a 1-1 draw against Millwall.

His second goal came on 12 December 2009 in a 3-0 win over Tranmere Rovers [...] and his third on 13 March 2010 in a 1-0 win over Leeds United.

5000|$|Powder Coating {{is a type}} of coating that {{is applied}} as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main {{difference}} between a conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a [...] "skin". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a <b>hard</b> <b>finish</b> that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminum extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts. Newer technologies allow other materials, such as MDF (medium-density fibreboard), to be powder coated using different methods.|$|R
