40|$|Recent theory {{posits that}} {{accountability}} {{in public service}} can be enhanced by the use of"exit"and a"voice"mechanisms. With <b>exit</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> users of public services can choose alternative sources of supply. <b>Exit</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are viable when there is competition. They are not viable for essential services for which government is the sole provider. Voice mechanisms are the more likely option when the service providers is a monopoly. With voice mechanisms - for example, public meetings, local representation on public committees, or collective action by user groups - the public seeks better performance from public service providers without opting for alternative sources of supply. Considerable {{research has been done}} on how and whether <b>exit</b> <b>mechanisms</b> improve organizations'performance and accountability. Little research has been dome on whether voice mechanisms make service providers more accountable. The author addresses that issue by investigating whether providers of irrigation services in Indonesia were more accountable when the public used voice mechanisms. The author asked these questions: Did the use of voice improve public accountability in irrigation services? If accountability improved, did service outcomes also improve? The author focused on how voice works and the mechanisms through which it influences accountability. The author found that water user associations did make providers of irrigation services more accountable and that crop intensity increased as a result.

However, some unpleasant properties of their implied dynamics - namely, their explosive or implosive behaviour (firm size and number collapsing to zero or increasing indefinitely) - have been given only very little attention.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the trade off between <b>investment</b> {{incentives}} and <b>exit</b> costs for the location of foreign direct investment (FDI). This issue {{does not appear to}} have been tackled in much detail in the literature. The analysis considers the effect of profit taxation (as a measure of investment incentives) and an index of hiring and firing costs (proxying exit costs) on the location of US outward FDI in 33 host countries. The results suggest that US FDI, in particular in manufacturing is negatively affected by the level of profit taxation and exit costs. Hence, if countries want to attract FDI it may not suffice that incentives are provided in order to ease the entry of multinationals. Instead, it also appears to be important that exit costs are at a level attractive to multinationals. In other words, multinationals may not check into an attractive looking Hotel California type host country if it is difficult to leave.
