The problem which arises {{is to determine}} the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> trucks and their routes for the given demand (schedule and fuel quantities). The constraint {{is that there is no}} aircraft departure delay due to the refuelling process. The optimum solution is found here using the branch-and-bound technique.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the {{scheduling}} problem arising from refuelling multiple satellites in a constellation. It {{is assumed that}} there is no fuel delivered to the constellation externally. Instead, the satellites in the constellation are assumed to be capable <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> each other. The cost of the rendezvous maneuver between two satellites conducting a fuel transfer is taken into consideration in the formulation of the problem. The goal <b>of</b> the <b>refuelling</b> problem is to equalize the fuel stored among all satellites in the constellation after a refuelling period. It is shown that the problem of equalizing the fuel among the satellites can be formulated and solved as a maximum-weight matching problem. I...|$|R

40|$|Within the Dutch {{transition}} policy framework, {{the transition}} to hydrogen-based transport {{is seen as a}} promising option towards a sustainable transport system. One aspect of such transition processes that is emphasized in transition management is learning about user behaviour and preferences. However, while earlier research on sustainable mobility acknowledges the importance <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> infrastructure, {{the question of how to}} unroll such an infrastructure and the role of user practices and user behaviour largely remains unanswered. In this paper we present an agent-based model to study the process of development from niche to market for hydrogen vehicles. We thereby focus on the role of users in this process and support our model by empirical data. Within this model the effects of different strategies for hydrogen infrastructure development on hydrogen vehicle fleet penetration are studied. More specifically, diffusion patterns for hydrogen vehicles are created through the interactions <b>of</b> consumers, <b>refuelling</b> stations and technological learning. The main result is that social network effects do influence the technological trajectory of hydrogen vehicles and thus should be taken into account by infrastructure developers and policymakers...|$|R
