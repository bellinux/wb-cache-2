50|$|By {{the early}} '60's, Trans-Lux {{began to see}} a need for greater {{investment}} in electronics as stock <b>exchanges</b> and <b>brokerage</b> firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.|$|R

40|$|This article takes a new {{perspective}} on business and politics in Ireland from the comparative literature on business financing of politics. It introduces a theoretical language based on the concepts of ideological and pragmatic donations and discrete and reciprocal exchange. It goes on to discuss {{the extent to which the}} Irish political system generates incentives for these types of behaviour. Its empirical core is a quantitative analysis of disclosed donations to TDs between 2002 and 2009, but it also exploits anecdotal and official sources. This study concludes that there has been considerable scope for the <b>exchange</b> of <b>brokerage</b> services in reciprocation for small disclosed donations. Current reform proposals will reduce but not eliminate this potential, especially if there is no enumeration of commercial payments and loans received by politicians and parties...|$|R

The second development came in 1986 when the Tokyo <b>exchange</b> permitted non-Japanese <b>brokerage</b> firms to become members for the first time. By 1988 the exchange had sixteen foreign members. The Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange had 124 member companies in 1990.

2500|$|A {{requirement}} of the New York Stock <b>Exchange</b> was that <b>brokerage</b> firms had to have offices [...] "clustered around Wall Street" [...] so clerks could deliver physical paper copies of stock certificates each week. There were some indications that midtown had been becoming the locus of financial services dealings even by 1911.

Many financial firms found that they could move to midtown Manhattan four miles away or elsewhere and still operate effectively.

Between January 1870 to September 1870, only 4 {{million shares of}} stock were <b>exchanged.</b> Dozens of <b>brokerage</b> firms went bankrupt, while those who bought paper gold from Fisk's gold room went unpaid. Farmers, who {{constituted}} 50 percent of the country's workforce, suffered the worst; wheat prices on the Chicago trade fell from $1.40 to $0.77 cents a bushel. Corn dropped from $0.95 to $0.68 cents; while other commodities such as rye, oats, and barley had similar losses. The New York Tribune reported that goods ready for export could not be shipped. American agriculture went into steep decline and would be plagued by tight money and dwindling markets for years to come.
