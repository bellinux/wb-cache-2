5000|$|In {{addition}} to threatening the King's authority, {{the existence of}} jurisdictional overlap jeopardized the uniformity of legal remedies by allowing for <b>forum-shopping.</b> For example, both the King and the Church claimed jurisdiction over disputes between executors and debtors and between creditors and executors. In the Church's eyes, {{the right of the}} executor to collect debts from a decedent's debtors and the right of creditors to enforce theirs claims against a decedent’s estate were [...] "a proper part of probate administration". Thus, while for most obligations a testator would have to sue under common law, an executor or creditor could chose between initiating a proceeding in a secular or ecclesiastical court. By issuing a writ of prohibition restraining executors or creditors from suing in an ecclesiastical court, this inequitable disparity in forum options could be resolved.|$|E

Warren disagreed with historian Charles A. Beard's economic analysis of the Constitution published in 1912, but by 1925 as a progressive Warren agreed that the court's conservative analysis was strait-jacketing Congress, a theme he elaborated in Congress, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court. Justice Louis Brandeis cited the work (revised in 1935) in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), which cut back on <b>forum-shopping</b> by wealthy litigants using the old case of Swift v. Tyson (1842). Warren also published Bankruptcy in United States History in 1935, based on lectures he had given at Northwestern University School of Law. Other schools at which the legal historian lectured included the University of Rochester, Boston University School of Law, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Virginia, the University of Chicago, and several others.|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{approach}} in Hanna v. Plumer, {{the federal court}} of a state hearing a case based on diversity jurisdiction should apply state law {{in the event of}} conflict between state and federal law if the state law deals with substantive rights of state citizens. The Supreme Court has defined substantive rights as, [...] "rights conferred by the law to be protected and enforced by the adjective law of judicial procedure." [...] An example of a substantive right would be a state law on fraud, which may vary widely in composition depending on the jurisdiction. If the state law is merely procedural, or relating merely to the form and mode of judicial operations, then the federal court does not have to apply the conflicting state law. However, the substance-procedure distinction is a generality as the Court rejected any test based upon [...] "litmus paper criterion." [...] Thus, a choice between state and federal law must be made with reference to the underlying policy of the Erie decision. The Court announced a modification of the [...] "outcome-determinative" [...] test in York, whereby the test must be applied in light of the twin aims of Erie, which are the discouragement of <b>forum-shopping</b> and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws. Under this rule, state procedural law would not supplant federal procedural law if the differences in the outcome are nonsubstantial or trivial, fail to raise Equal Protection concerns, and are unlikely to influence the choice of forum.|$|E
40|$|Procedural {{evolution}} in complex litigation {{seems to have}} left the civil jury behind. Reliance on aggregating devices, such as multidistrict litigation and class actions, as well as settlement pressure created by “bellwether” cases, has resulted in cases of national scope being tried by local juries. Local juries thus {{have the potential to}} impose their values {{on the rest of the}} country. This trend motivates parties to <b>forum-shop,</b> and some commentators suggest eliminating jury trials in complex cases altogether. Yet the jury is at the heart of our uniquely American understanding of civil justice, and the Seventh Amendment mandates its use in federal cases. This Article makes a bold proposal to align the jury assembly mechanism with the scope of the litigation: In cases of national scope, juries would be assembled from a national pool. This proposal would eliminate incentives for parties to <b>forum-shop,</b> and it would make the decisionmaking body representative of the population that will feel the effects of its decision. The Article argues that we would see greater legitimacy for decisions rendered by a national jury in national cases. Moreover, it argues that geographic diversification of the jury would enhance the quality of decisionmaking. Finally, national juries would preserve the functional and constitutional values of citizen participation in the civil justice system...|$|R
40|$|In his new book, Courting Failure: How Competition for Big Cases is Corrupting the Bankruptcy Courts, Professor Lynn LoPucki’s book {{argues that}} that current {{bankruptcy}} venue rules have spawned an improper “competition for big cases” that has “corrupted” America’s bankruptcy courts. LoPucki argues that this competition has harmed the bankruptcy {{system and the}} economy, transferring wealth from creditors and employees to incumbent management and bankruptcy professionals. He also argues that the competition that has corrupted the American bankruptcy system is being replicated internationally, resulting in a similar competition and similar harm on the global stage. This essay reviews LoPucki’s book and its central theoretical and empirical arguments. LoPucki offers powerful empirical evidence that something is amiss with much of current American bankruptcy practice. This essay will try to flesh out in more detail the model and theoretical foundations that implicit underlie LoPucki’s indictment of bankruptcy <b>forum-shopping</b> (and other forms of <b>forum-shopping</b> as well). Empirical evidence standing alone is insufficient to draw conclusions about whether <b>forum-shopping</b> is in general good or bad without a clearly-stated hypothesis to test. Instead, {{it is necessary to}} also have a theoretical model sufficient to generate testable hypotheses as a predicate both for determining whether <b>forum-shopping</b> is good or bad on net, as well as the likely effects of reform proposals. Although LoPucki identifies several problem areas in the current Chapter 11 reorganization process, it is not as clear that all of these problems can be clearly attributed to runaway <b>forum-shopping.</b> Instead, they may simply be good-faith errors or mistakes, for which continued competition may be beneficial, in that the competition may actually expedite the process of self-correction. This review essay develops a model of the institutions and incentives governing the <b>forum-shopping</b> competition described by LoPucki in an effort to determine whether the empirical observations proffered by LoPucki can be best explained as the outcome of improper <b>forum-shopping</b> competition. The essay then closes with an analysis of provisions of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, noting that many of the provisions in the legislation offer substantive responses to many of the problems identified by LoPucki...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the author tackles {{one of the}} long-standing {{theoretical}} issues of international law: fragmentation that has been caused inter alia by so-called self-contained or special legal regimes.

It seems that special legal regimes have not diligently followed {{the advice of the}} ILC for constructing their ties with the general legal order and other special regimes despite the fact that there exist instruments for solving such conflicts. The proliferation of international courts and tribunals seem to have contributed to conflicting jurisprudence and <b>forum-shopping</b> thereby causing both legal uncertainty and inequality.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of international rules, laws, and institutional forms raises important questions for regime theory. Looking at the {{theoretical and empirical}} arguments presented by all the contributors, however, {{it seems clear that}} that complexity’s effects on actor strategies—particularly powerful actors—remain open to debate. Some of the posited effects of international regime complexity have contradictory or cross-cutting effects. Further effects of regime complexity—cross-institutional strategizing, the asymmetrical distribution of legal and technical expertise, and the fragmentation of reputation—can erode the significance of institutions in complex environments. This contribution considers the effect that regime complexity has on how powerful actors approach world politics—in part by connecting the current debate with past discussions about the significance of international regimes in world politics. K aren Alter and Sophie Meunier correctly point outthat the recent {{proliferation of}} international rules,laws, and institutional forms present important ques-tions for regime theory.

40|$|Asbestos {{was once}} {{referred}} to as a “miracle mineral ” for its ability to withstand heat and it was used in thousands of products. But exposure to asbestos causes cancer and other diseases. As of the beginning of 2001, 600, 000 individuals had filed lawsuits for asbestos-related diseases against more than 6, 000 defendants. 85 firms have filed for bankruptcy due to asbestos liabilities and several insurers have failed or are in financial distress. More than $ 54 billion has been spent on the litigation – higher than any other mass tort. Estimates of the eventual cost of asbestos litigation range from $ 200 to $ 265 billion. The paper examines the history of asbestos regulation and asbestos liability and argues that it was liability rather than regulation that eventually caused producers to eliminate asbestos from most products by the late 1970 s. But despite the disappearance of asbestos products from the marketplace, asbestos litigation continued to grow.

40|$|The article {{outlines}} {{a simple}} thesis: that international investment arbitration – pursuant to regional and bilateral investment treaties – offers the clearest example of global administrative law, strictly construed, yet to have emerged. We present this thesis by explicating four key features of investment treaties: they permit investor claims {{against the state}} without exhausting local remedies; they allow claims for damages; they allow investors to directly seek enforcement of awards before domestic courts; and they facilitate <b>forum-shopping.</b> Our argument is that, owing to this unique conjunction of features, the regulatory conduct of states is, to an unusual extent, subject to control through compulsory international adjudication. Having highlighted these features, we then claim that investment arbitration is best analogized to domestic administrative law rather than to international commercial arbitration, especially since investment arbitration engages disputes arising from the exercise of public authority by the state as opposed to private acts of the state. Further, we claim that the linkages between investment arbitration and domestic legal systems are more direct and more closely integrated than other forms of international adjudication in the public sphere. For these reasons, we argue that the emerging regime of investment arbitration is {{to be understood as}} constituting an important and powerful manifestation of global administrative law...|$|E
40|$|To prevent plaintiffs from harassing the {{defendant}} or engaging in <b>forum-shopping,</b> {{the common law}} doctrine of forum non conveniens permits trial courts to dismiss a foreign plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s suit, over which it would normally have jurisdiction, if both the parties 2 ̆ 7 convenience and the ends of justice are best served by dismissal. Supreme Court precedent requires courts to weigh a number of private and public interest factors, and gives foreign plaintiffs less deference in their choice of forum than a domestic plaintiff. Applying this test in Abad v. Bayer Corporation, the Seventh Circuit upheld the dismissal of two cases involving Argentinean plaintiffs who brought product liability claims against American corporations in U. S. courts. Abad illustrates {{that the nature of}} the doctrine and the lenient standard of appellate review of forum non conveniens decisions give district courts too much discretion in determining whether dismissal is warranted. This Comment will highlight inconsistencies between the district court decisions affirmed in Abad, and it proposes that the Seventh Circuit should adjust the doctrine to ensure that district courts apply a consistent framework by (1) returning to the original conception of the doctrine set forth in Gilbert, (2) using a nation-to-nation analysis of the relative public interests, (3) adopting the Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s sliding scale approach to the less deference rule, and (4) refusing to consider parties 2 ̆ 7 willingness to make concessions...|$|E
40|$|This essay, {{written for}} a {{symposium}} on the 20 th anniversary of Philips Petroleum v. Shutts, critically examines {{the legacy of}} Shutts. The first part argues that Shutss solved the immediate problem of allowing a centralized forum to adjudicate common claims of market-based harms, despite the multistate citizenship of the affected individuals. Shutts handled this by applying a due process balancing approach {{to the question of}} personal jurisdiction and, in turn, allowing notice and the ability to opt out to suffice to establish binding personal jurisdiction over class actions. Shutts could not, however, provide a mechanism to ensure that the forum in which the case was consolidated was the most appropriate place to litigate the matter, as opposed to simply being an appropriate forum. The result was widespread <b>forum-shopping</b> in class actions. That problem has been addressed, to some extent, by the newly enacted Class Action Fairness Act. The second part of this essay addresses the problem of choice of law once a case is consolidated in a single proceeding. Shutts struck down the application of forum law to transactions that were unrelated to the Kansas site of the litigation. But Shutts left open the question of what the permissible parameters of choice of law should be. This essay concludes with an argument for why the use of a standardized body of law, such as that from the home state of the defendant, is the necessary next step for the efficient adjudication of common market-based claims...|$|E
40|$|While the European Union (EU) {{has been}} the leading {{advocate}} of incorporating competition rules into the World Trade Organization (WTO), its efforts failed in 2003 {{with the collapse of}} negotiations at the Cancun Ministerial. This paper tests the relative influence of two prominent issue linkage tactics—trade-competition and competition-Singapore Issues—employed by the EU in its failed efforts to add competition policy to the WTO negotiating agenda. Although the US did not actively oppose either linkage, it also did not offer active support. This lack of support was further diminished by <b>forum-shopping</b> opportunities {{and the fact that it}} had invested less resources and reputation in either linkage tactic. The analysis suggests that the failure to add competition policy to the WTO negotiating agenda is best explained by developing country opposition to the trade-competition linkage. Developing countries opposed this linkage because it was distant and indirectly linked to trade (ie, fuzzy), they suffered from a related information asymmetry, and they viewed competition policy as a threat to their interests. Developing countries also opposed the competition-Singapore Issues linkage because it multiplied the resource costs associated with the trade-competition linkage and was not seen as complementary to their interests. While both linkages were ‘destructive’, a counterfactual analysis suggests that developing country opposition to the trade-competition linkage was the deciding factor in the failure. Based on the findings, the paper concludes with preliminary comments on the dangers of negotiating at the fuzzy border. The study introduces original research based on a qualitative analysis of secondary and primary sources, including official government and WTO documents and speeches. ...|$|E
40|$|As when Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins {{was decided}} seventy years ago, federal courts today {{are seen as}} more {{favorable}} to corporate and business interests than many of their state-court brethren. The current situation is due {{in no small part}} to federal courts 2 ̆ 7 comparatively pro-defendant approaches to summary judgment, class certification, and other procedural issues. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, which tilts federal pleading standards in favor of defendants, will likely have similar federalism implications. This Article presents a straightforward argument that the Erie doctrine may require federal courts to follow state-law standards on summary judgment, class certification, and pleading. This argument has strong support in Supreme Court case-law and the black-letter framework for resolving Erie issues, yet it would significantly recalibrate the conventional understanding of judicial federalism in civil adjudication. Ironically, the 2005 Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) — whose expansion of federal diversity jurisdiction over high-stakes civil litigation was a major political victory for the defense side — strengthens Erie 2 ̆ 7 s preference for state law, because it confirms that procedural disparities between state and federal courts cause precisely the kind of <b>forum-shopping</b> and inequitable treatment that Erie aims to prohibit. Because Erie is likely to {{play a critical role in}} the politically-charged arena of contemporary litigation, this Article also confronts some of the broader conceptual and theoretical problems that have plagued the Erie doctrine during its first seventy years.

This Article thus provides a coherent doctrinal framework for considering the challenges Erie may face in the years to come. Reprinted by permission of the publisher...|$|E
40|$|At present, three {{international}} conventions (one {{of which has}} been modified by many signatory states to produce a fourth regime), together with certain pre-existing national regimes, provide this entitlement to limit most types of private law liability arising in the ordinary course of the shipowner’s activities. Limitation may be invoked by the shipowner in two principal ways: by way of a defence, or by commencing a limitation action, which latter normally involves constituting a limitation fund. Whether the shipowner should take the initiative and start a limitation action, or whether he or she should wait and use limitation as a defence, will depend on the choice of fora available. Significant differences among jurisdictions inevitably give rise to <b>forum-shopping.</b> In the course of this book’s practical explanation and discussion of shipowners’ rights to limit their liability, the authors consider how the conflict of laws rules of various jurisdictions might be used by parties in international commerce to raise the most advantageous defence or select the most suitable tribunal to commence a limitation action. For each potentially applicable limitation regime, the book identifies the amount to which liability is limited and the tests that apply when a claimant wishes to challenge a shipowner’s right to limit liability. Among the issues brought to the fore are the following:- - right to the lowest limit versus the strongest protection of the right to limit; - circumstances under which the ship against which the action is brought may be arrested and sold; - when the shipowner’s right to limit can be challenged and denied; - action in rem for collisions; - freezing injunctions; - direct action against an insurer. The book also discusses various specific liability regimes that address damage suffered by passengers, damage to cargo interests, oil pollution damage from tankers, damage from bunker oil from non tankers, and damage caused by hazardous and noxious cargoes. As an in-depth exploration and analysis {{of the differences between the}} various limitation regimes that provide shipowners with a global entitlement to limit liability – and the broader legal issues such limitation rights gives rise to – this book will prove invaluable to any party involved in shipping disputes. Lawyers representing either shipowners (and other parties with an interest in the ship’s operations) or claimants will clearly identify the major issues related to the selection of the appropriate forum for the limitation of liability, including procedural details...|$|E
40|$|In Flores v. Southern Peru Copper Corporation, the U. S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, re-examined its Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) {{jurisprudence}} {{and assumed}} that a private domestic company acting in its private capacity could be liable to Peruvian nationals under the ATCA {{for a wide}} range of torts under international law, including violations of rights to “life and health. ” Previous cases and other Circuits held that only a handful of egregious crimes, when committed by a private individual or corporation, can justify private liability under the ATCA. Rather than abiding by these interpretations, however, the court examined in depth the sufficiency of the Peruvians 2 ̆ 7 claims without addressing the threshold issue of private liability. Ultimately, the Flores court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Peruvians 2 ̆ 7 environmental claims, styled as claims for life and health. Nevertheless, the court raised the prospect of wide-ranging ATCA liability by suggesting that if it had found sufficient consensus in “customary international law” regarding the illegality of Southern Peru Copper Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s intra-national pollution, the claims may have been granted subject matter jurisdiction. The court came to the proper conclusion in rejecting subject matter jurisdiction. However, it wrongly applied the holding in Filartiga v. Pena-Irala-which considered only state-sponsored activity-to claims against a private corporation acting in its private capacity. Whether this misplaced reliance on Filartiga and failure to set a threshold standard for private corporate liability was intentional or mistaken, it was a grave error, putting private corporations at risk for snowballing private corporate liability under the ATCA. The Flores court should have issued a more limited holding and re-emphasized that private, non-state-sponsored actions will only engender Filartiga-style ATCA analysis in a limited set of egregious circumstances. Instead, as this note will examine, the court opened the door for endless and unpredictable liability, double recovery, and <b>forum-shopping</b> that could eventually stifle U. S. multi-national corporation (“MNC”) investment and activity abroad, hamper the competitiveness of U. S. MNCs abroad, and cost such companies millions of dollars in extensive discovery and briefing on every claim brought in the Second Circuit. The ideal solution to the problem presented by the Flores decision would be for Congress or the Supreme Court to clarify all aspects of liability under the ATCA, particularly corporate liability. While the Supreme Court recently issued its long-awaited first decision addressing the scope of the ATCA, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, it specifically left open the corporate actor question under the ATCA. To respond to this confusion, and to redress cases such as Flores, Congress and the Circuits must set a standard which makes individual corporate liability a threshold question, as in the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s panel decision in Doe v.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Cross-border {{insolvency}} law primarily {{deals with the}} situation where an insolvency procedure is initiated in one jurisdiction, {{in relation to the}} property of a debtor who is situated in another jurisdiction. ' The liquidator then has to consider which procedures to follow and which system of law would apply in the administration of the debtor's property, wherever situated, for the benefit of local and foreign creditors. To regulate cross-border insolvency procedures more effectively, South Africa has assented to the Cross-Border Insolvency Act 42 of 2000 (hereafter the CBA). This act is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency. The CBA is still not operational, mainly because of the failure of the Minister of Justice to designate certain states and will only be applicable to cross-border insolvency proceedings once a state is designated. This has the effect that the CBA will assist insolvency agents and creditors of the foreign designated states when they institute insolvency proceedings against a debtor who also has assets or a business in South Africa. The CBA does, however, not assist a South African insolvency agent or South African creditors when instituting insolvency proceedings against a debtor who also has assets or a business in a foreign country. To achieve such reciprocity the foreign state would need a similar act in which South Africa is a designated state. Company N, for example, is situated in the Netherlands, which has not incorporated the UNICTRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvencies. Company S, its creditor, is situated in South Africa. Suppose company A has movable and immovable property in South Africa and the Netherlands. If company N goes bankrupt, a number of problematic questions arise: Where should company S institute insolvency proceedings? Which system of law would apply to the insolvency proceedings and would the courts in the Netherlands recognise a South African court order for the winding-up of company N? In the absence of a binding international insolvency act that applies universally, states have to turn to their own domestic laws for guidance to regulate these proceedings. The sovereignty of states and the protection of national interests contribute to the inefficiency of these proceedings. The question of the appropriate jurisdiction is further complicated by the different insolvency approaches states follow. Some states follow the territorial approach while others follow the universal approach which leads to great conflicts in the determination of the proper forum to institute cross-border insolvency proceedings. With the universal approach two further complications arise, namely <b>forum-shopping</b> and COMI. With forum shopping creditors seek the forum that will provide the greatest advantage to their interests, while COMI (centre of main interest) as a means to determine the appropriate forum under the universal approach is very vague and increases uncertainty rather than clarity. Multinational treaties or conventions prove to be less effective in an effort to increase co-operation between states than expected. Few examples of functional multinational treaties on insolvency exist. Bilateral treaties between countries are another option and easier to negotiate, but just as few examples of functional bilateral treaties exist. The question that will henceforth be discussed in this dissertation, is whether a protocol between South Africa and foreign countries would contribute to a more workable and effective solution to jurisdiction problems in cross-border insolvency proceedings between these states? In order to address the above mentioned question, the jurisdiction problem, together with the occurrence of the territorial and universal approach in cross-border insolvencies will be discussed in chapter 2.

40|$|Commentators {{frequently}} {{claim that}} there is no single, coherent doctrine of extra-territorial personal jurisdiction, and, unfortunately, they are correct. The International Shoe case, commonly (but inaccurately) thought of as the wellspring of the modern form of the doctrine, announced a relatively straightforward, two-factor, four-permutation test that worked well for resolving most cases. In the nearly sixty-year period following Shoe, however, as the Supreme Court expanded and refined the standard, what was once straightforward and uncomplicated became serendipitous and convoluted. Two general, and generally incompatible, versions of the doctrine competed for dominance. The first, what might best be described as a totality-of-the-circumstances view, is essentially a balancing test which weighs the convenience interests of litigants against the sovereignty interests of state and federal governments to situate litigation wherever those collective interests are reasonably accommodated. The second, perhaps best described as a defendant-veto view, is a kind of single-factor test that permits defendants to escape the extra-territorial reach of a state 2 ̆ 7 s personal jurisdictional power by avoiding certain kinds of purposeful contacts with the state. There is some overlap between these two versions of the doctrine, of course, but also a considerable area of difference, and the two views dictate opposite results when the forum a defendant has studiously avoided is a (or even the most) convenient forum. In the decade immediately after Shoe, the competition between the two views remained in relative equilibrium, with neither view gaining a clear upper hand, {{but at the end of}} that period, in the bookend cases of Hanson v. Denckla and McGee v. International Life Insurance Company, the Supreme Court reached opposite results, relying on the defendant-veto view in Hanson and the totality-of-the-circumstances view in McGee, when the reverse outcomes seemed to make more sense. It was as if, after ten years of thinking about it, the Court was no clearer on what form the doctrine should take than it was when it started. The doctrine then sat nearly dormant for about twenty years, during which the Court made few systematic attempts to restate or reformulate it. It was not until the early 1980 s, in a spate of now well-known cases (Kulko, Helicol, Ireland, Keeton, Calder, Woodson, Burger King, and Asahi, among others), that the Court got back into the field, mostly to reinforce the defendant-veto view, which had been losing ground in the lower federal and state courts. In this important series of cases the Court added considerable sophistication to the doctrine, but introduced a number of confusing elements as well. The confusion was caused principally by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s unfortunate propensity to use key concepts to mean more than one thing, to change doctrinal terminology without indicating that it was doing so, to use more than one term to express the same idea, to fail to ground the doctrine adequately in the Constitution (causing many to question its legitimacy), and to mix and match substantive law and jurisdictional concerns in developing doctrinal principles, all the while professing that it was not doing any of these. Lower federal and state courts were confused by all of this, of course, and began to add layers of confusion of their own, relying sometimes on one part of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s thinking and other times on other parts. Many courts, for example, all but eliminated the category of general jurisdiction, at least as originally understood and articulated in Shoe, by making its requirements either identical to, or less demanding than, those required for the supposedly easier-to-satisfy category of specific jurisdiction. Courts also ignored the distinction between contacts and fairness considerations in the specific jurisdiction standard, and began to treat both types of factors as interchangeable and free-standing jurisdictional tests in their own right. And still other courts defined the nexus requirement of specific jurisdiction to include almost any kind of relationship between the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s forum contacts and the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim, confusing litigants and undercutting the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s veto right. These and equivalent doctrinal frolics-and-detours have caused serious problems for litigants, lawyers, and judges, of course, who want to know where suits may be brought and where they will have to defend. The problem is especially serious in periods when the Supreme Court is not taking personal jurisdiction cases, since there is little prospect of reversing erroneous lower court decisions. The lack of a clear standard also exacerbates the pressure on litigants to forum shop, and <b>forum-shopping,</b> in turn, reinforces the familiar rule-of-law criticism of American courts, that their decisions lack legitimacy because they are based more on home court prejudice than on substantive entitlement. It may be that the Supreme Court is about to get back into the personal jurisdiction business, however, in part to clear up the difficulties described above, and in part to resolve new kinds of problems raised by cases in which the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s forum contacts are made over the internet. The roughly twenty year dormancy period in which the Court, historically, has not taken personal jurisdiction cases is coming to an end, for one thing, and many of the internet-contacts cases that have now begun to proliferate present interesting questions not easily resolved by existing doctrinal formulations. Early internet (mostly commercial dealing) cases were not all that different from the telephone contacts and stream-of-commerce pollution contacts cases familiar in the Shoe era, but the newest set of cases, principally those involving libel and intellectual property claims, present questions not easily answered by earlier formulations of the standard, and they have produced a wide variety of not always consistent or satisfactory responses in the lower federal and state courts. In this article I hope to sort out some of these confusions, and offer suggestions for how the Court, using the internet cases, might get the personal jurisdictional doctrine back on track...|$|E
