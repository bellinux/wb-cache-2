40|$|To {{examine the}} {{importance}} of albumen as a protein source during embryonic development on the posthatch performance of laying hens, 3 mL of the albumen was removed. At hatch, no difference in BW could be observed. Chicks from the albumen-deprived group had a lower residual yolk weight due to higher yolk utilization. During the rearing phase (hatch to 17 wk of age), the BW of the albumen-deprived pullets was lower compared with the control and sham pullets. The feed intake of the albumen-deprived pullets was also lower than the control pullets. However, during the laying phase (18 to 55 wk of age) these hens exceeded the control and sham hens in BW, although this was not accompanied by a higher feed intake. The albumen-deprived hens exhibited a lower <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> {{as demonstrated by the}} reduced egg weight, laying rate, and egg mass and increased number of second grade eggs. In addition, the eggs laid by the albumen-deprived hens had a higher proportional yolk and lower proportional albumen weight. In conclusion, prenatal protein deprivation by albumen removal caused a long-lasting programming effect, possibly by differences in energy allocation, in favor of growth and maintenance and impairing reproductive performance.

The present study conducted to evaluate the impacts of colloidal particles (30 nm - 1 &# 181;m) and fine solids (2 &# 181;m &# 150; 60 &# 181;m) on nauplii and egg production of the copepod A. tonsa in three systems: conventional recirculating system (cRAS), membrane modified recirculating system (mRAS) and flow through aquaculture system (FTAS). The initial copepod density was 75000 ind L- 1 for investigating of growth performance and 15 ind L- 1 for testing of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> of the copepods within 4 weeks. The results in the present study showed a better water quality regarding nitrogenous waste products and colloidal particles concentration in the FTAS compared to the RAS systems (cRAS and mRAS) during the experiment. The survival rate, nauplii and egg production of the copepods in the FTAS were significantly higher than the RAS systems (p 0. 05). The high concentration of colloidal particles in the RAS systems during the experiment could be an indication for the significant difference of nauplii and egg production compared to the FTAS (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, no effects of fine solids in all systems were observed on the performance of A. tonsa in terms of survival, growth and development, as well as nauplii and egg production rate. An efficient removal of colloidal particles in the mRAS compared to the cRAS and FTAS was only observed after increasing the water exchange rate (to 8 times daily volume tank) from 8 days post hatching. </p...|$|E

No <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> model exists that includes a measure of persistency in terms of duration of time or that allows this measure of persistency to be derived from model parameters. It was necessary, therefore, to develop a new model to describe an <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curve for a flock: Please see model within the full paper, due to the limits of computer coding. and for an individual: where yt = <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> at time t, t 1 and t 2 = times at transition, r = duration of transition, yP = level of constant production, b 4 = rate of decline in production, and P = persistency of constant production.

Since the molting was negatively correlated to the 48 weeks <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (r = - 0. 896 for PA and - 0. 553 for AP), then this trait can be used as the selection criterion for <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The linear regression equation for PA of 48 weeks <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> = 80. 7 - 0. 369 molting duration, and for AP of 48 weeks <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> = 84 - 0. 299 molting duration...|$|R

40|$|Objective The Bashang Long-tail chicken (BS), an {{indigenous}} Chinese breed, is considered cold tolerant. We selected BS, the Rhode Island Red (RIR), and their reciprocal crossbreds {{for the present}} study. The objectives were: i) to validate whether BS is cold tolerant and whether <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> and cold tolerance of crossbreds could be improved; and ii) to determine the physiological characteristics that underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance in cold environments. Methods A total of 916 chickens were reared in warm and natural cold environments (daily mean ambient temperature varied from 7. 4 °C to 26. 5 °C in the warm environment and from − 17. 5 °C to 27. 0 °C in the cold environment). To investigate their adaptability to the cold environment, the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance and body weight were monitored and compared between breeds and environments. The cloacal temperature and serum biochemical parameters were monitored to reveal the physiological characteristics underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance in the cold environment. Results The warm environment experiment showed that RIR had the highest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance, and that the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance than BS. While in the cold environment RIR had the lowest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance, and the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance than BS. In the cold environment BS and reciprocal crossbreds had higher triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine levels than RIR. At 35 and 39 wk of age, when the ambient temperature was extremely low (varied from − 20 °C to 0 °C), serum glucose, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol of BS and crossbreds were higher than RIR. Conclusion Bashang Long-tail chicken has a favorable cold tolerance ability. Crossbreeding with RIR and BS is {{an effective way to}} develop cold tolerant chickens with improved <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} aimed to improve <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> by decreasing the intersequence pause days between the sequences of egg lay in girirani birds through chemical control of prolactin by using bromocriptine (an anti prolactin chemical) through feed. At 12 weeks of age, forty two girirani birds were randomly divided into control (n= 21) and treated (n= 21) groups. Birds in the treated group were fed bromocriptine through feed @ 350 µg/bird/day from 17 - 36 weeks of age and controls were fed the same ration without bromocriptine. Birds fed with bromocriptine through feed significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced the prolactin concentration compared to control birds. Estradiol and progesterone were quantified in both the groups. Treated birds showed higher (P< 0. 01) concentration of estradiol and progesterone concentration from 19 th to 72 weeks of age with intermittent fluctuations. <b>Egg</b> <b>production,</b> pause days, and hormonal parameters were correlated between the two groups. Prolactin is negatively correlated with <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (r =- 0. 89), estradiol (r =- 0. 59) and progesterone (r =- 0. 37) hormones and positively correlated with inter sequence pause days with concomitant decrease in <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Birds fed bromocriptine through feed showed significantly (P< 0. 01) less pause days and more <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The results of this study showed that, controlling the prolactin secretion by chemical means resulted in 5. 12 % increase in <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> over control birds, further such an approach is more promising, practicable, economical without any traces of chemical in meat, egg and blood to improve <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in backyard poultry farming. It is concluded that chemical control of prolactin plays a major role on pauses days, prolactin secretion and <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in native breed of birds.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{described}} and analysed changes {{in the numbers of}} large ovarian follicles (diameter 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm) and in the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol- 17 beta (E 2 beta) in relation to individual <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> figures of farmed ostriches (Struthio camelus spp.) throughout one year. Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling for plasma hormone analysis were performed in 9 hens on a monthly basis during the breeding season and in two periods of the non-breeding season. Our data demonstrated that: (1) large follicles were detected and LH concentrations were elevated already 1 month before first ovipositions of the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season took place; (2) E- 2 beta concentrations increased as soon as the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season started; (3) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations were elevated during the entire <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season; and that (4) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations decreased simultaneous with or following the last ovipositions of the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season. By comparing these parameters during the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season with their pre-and post-seasonal values, significant differences were found in the numbers of large follicles and E- 2 beta concentrations between the pre-seasonal, seasonal and post-seasonal period; while LH concentrations were significantly different between the seasonal and post-seasonal period. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that changes in numbers of large follicles and in concentrations of LH and E- 2 beta closely parallel individual <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> figures and provide some new cues that <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in ostriches is confined to a marked reproductive season. Moreover, our data provide indications that mechanism, initiating, maintaining and terminating the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season in farmed breeding ostriches are quite similar to those already known for other seasonal breeding bird species.
