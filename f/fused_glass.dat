30|$|Concentrations of 24 trace {{elements}} (Ba, Hf, Nb, Rb, Sr, Ta, Th, U, Y, Zr, and 14 {{rare earth elements}} (REEs)) were analyzed for three USGS GRMs (G- 3 granite, AGV- 2 andesite, and BHVO- 2 basalt). Each analysis for the GRM beads was performed as spot (ca. 55  μm diameter) analysis with 120 -s ablation time. The depth-to-diameter ratio of the laser spot was low (< 4) enough to prevent significant elemental fractionation. The NIST 612 glass and 29 Si were employed as the external standard and the internal standard element, respectively. When the middle half of time-integrated data was taken to minimize the fractionation effect, the low-dilution <b>fused</b> <b>glasses</b> yielded reproducible and accurate results for all analyzed elements. In the case of normal-dilution <b>fused</b> <b>glasses,</b> comparable precision and accuracy were obtained only for elements with concentrations higher than 1  μg g− 1, likely resulting from higher dilution ratios.|$|R

40|$|High second-order {{nonlinearity}} (SON) in poled silica glasses [l] is {{of great}} interest {{for the development of}} linear electro-optic modulators and frequency converters monolithically integrated into optical fibres or planar glass waveguides. However, its origin [1, 2] is not fully understood. The extrinsic effects of poling time and voltage on second-harmonic (SH) generation in thermally-poled silica glass have been studied [1, 3]. In particular the quadratic dependence of the maximum SH signal on the applied voltage indicated linear dependence of the SON on internal electric field [3]. There are several studies on intrinsic effects associated with defects [1, 41 and minority species such as OH [1, 5] and Na [1, 6] in thermal poling of silica glasses. In this work we carried out a systematic analysis of oxygen related defects and impurities (OH and Na) in commercial <b>fused</b> silica <b>glasses</b> (without relying on their catalogue data) and discuss their effects on SON. Table 1 shows the sample characterizations and the results of SH signal measurements in commercial <b>fused</b> silica <b>glasses.</b> We used three types of <b>fused</b> silica <b>glasses,</b> as in previous work [1, 4, 6]: electrically-fused quartz glass (type I), quartz <b>glass</b> <b>fused</b> in a HZ-O, flame (type II) and silica glass synthesized from SiCl, in a H,O,flame (type III).

5000|$|Today, a {{muffle furnace}} is (usually) a {{front-loading}} box-type oven or kiln for high-temperature {{applications such as}} <b>fusing</b> <b>glass,</b> creating enamel coatings, ceramics and soldering and brazing articles. They are also used in many research facilities, for example by chemists {{in order to determine}} what proportion of a sample is non-combustible and non-volatile (i.e., ash). Some digital controllers allow RS232 interface and permit the operator to program up to 126 segments, such as ramping, soaking, sintering, and more. Also, advances in materials for heating elements, such as molybdenum disilicide, can now produce working temperatures up to 1800 C, which facilitate more sophisticated metallurgical applications.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fused</b> <b>glass</b> {{techniques}} are generally {{used to create}} Art glass, glass tiles, and jewellery, notably beads. Slumping techniques allow the creation of larger, functional pieces like dishes, bowls, plates, and ashtrays. Producing functional pieces generally requires 2 or more separate firings, one to fuse the glass and a second slump it to shape.|$|E
50|$|Devitrification {{occurs in}} glass art during the firing process of <b>fused</b> <b>glass</b> whereby {{the surface of}} the glass {{develops}} a whitish scum, crazing, or wrinkles instead of a smooth glossy shine, as the molecules in the glass change their structure into that of crystalline solids. While this condition is normally undesired in glass art, it is possible to use devitrification as a deliberate artistic technique.|$|E
