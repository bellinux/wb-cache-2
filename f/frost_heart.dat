That desperate struggle seemed to be tearing her to death before his eyes, and Mr. Stone sat silent, trembling. He knew not what to do.

50|$|During {{the opening}} chapter of Utopia, the Dark Avengers are sent into San Francisco {{to quell the}} mutant riots and battle any X-Men they can find. Tension is shown to exist between the Avengers and Osborn's own Dark X-Men. When Namor and Emma Frost are {{revealed}} to be double agents on Cyclops' side and defect with Cloak and Dagger, an irate Osborn gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X-Men, Gargan included, ordering them to bring him Namor's head and Emma <b>Frost's</b> <b>heart</b> {{and to make sure}} that Cyclops sees them do it. The Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia and battle the X-Men, with Venom facing off against Colossus. Due to the sheer number of X-Men, Osborn is forced to retreat when informed that the only way to win would be to kill all the mutants on the island, an option which is not politically viable.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, however, {{she would}} have fits of boisterous hilarity, not quite natural, with a strange note half pathetic, half jeering. Her father tended to a supercilious, sneering tone. In Vina {{it came out in}} mad bursts of hilarious jeering. This made Miss Frost uneasy. She would watch the girl's strange face, that could take on a {{gargoyle}} look. She would see the eyes rolling strangely under sardonic eyelids, and then Miss Frost would feel that never, never had she known anything so utterly alien and incomprehensible and unsympathetic as her own beloved Vina. For twenty years the strong, protective governess reared and tended her lamb, her dove, only to see the lamb open a wolf's mouth, to hear the dove utter the wild cackle of a daw or a magpie, a strange sound of derision. At such times Miss <b>Frost's</b> <b>heart</b> went cold within her. She dared not realize. And she chid and checked her ward, restored her to the usual impulsive, affectionate demureness. Then she dismissed the whole matter. It was just an accidental aberration on the girl's part from her own true nature. Miss Frost taught Alvina thoroughly the qualities of her own true nature, and Alvina believed what she was taught. She remained for twenty years the demure, refined creature of her governess' desire. But there was an odd, derisive look {{at the back of her}} eyes, a look of old knowledge and deliberate derision. She herself was unconscious of it. But it was there. And this it was, perhaps, that scared away the young men.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{revealed}} that Dani Moonstar went to Vegas {{to make a}} deal with Hela, asking for a new ride home and a big sword, implying that she wishes to regain her Valkyrie powers. Emma's team successfully disables the Bio-Sentinels and takes down Trask. The Dark X-Men and watch the Omega Machine in action. Meanwhile, Madison Jeffries and Psylocke have finished the final installations to the ship. Back at Alcatraz, Hank McCoy looks even weaker. Dark Beast goes to look for more subjects, but finds that Magik and X-Force have teleported them out, as Mindee had warned him. X-Force faces off against Weapon Omega and Dark Beast. Cyclops has Nightcrawler and Pixie gather all their forces in the chapel and Magik and Pixie teleport them all away, group by group, saying it's [...] "time to go home". The Dark X-Men face off against X-Force, with Frost and Namor revealing themselves as still on the good guy's team by taking out Daken and Mimic. Cloak and Dagger flee with Namor, Frost and X-Force after Magik evacuates all the prisoners. The remaining Dark X-Men head back to talk to Osborn. The [...] "ship" [...] the X-Club has reactivated rises up {{out of the water and}} {{is revealed}} to be an island built onto Asteroid M. Several mutants gather around Cyclops as he declares, via a televised speech, that the island is outside of Osborn and H.A.M.M.E.R.'s jurisdiction. Cyclops further declares the X-Men's stand against Osborn. Osborn then gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X-Men, ordering them to bring him Namor's head and <b>Frost's</b> <b>heart</b> and that Summers see them do it.|$|R

6000|$|We {{take all}} {{things in a}} minor key as we grow older. There are few majestic {{passages}} in the later acts of life's opera. Ambition takes a less ambitious aim. Honor becomes more reasonable and conveniently adapts itself to circumstances. And love--love dies. [...] "Irreverence for the dreams of youth" [...] soon creeps like a killing <b>frost</b> upon our <b>hearts.</b> The tender shoots and the expanding flowers are nipped and withered, and of a vine that yearned to stretch its tendrils round the world there is left but a sapless stump.|$|R

40|$|Frost crack {{represents}} one of the main defects which affect European beech wood quality. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to improve the knowledge regarding both the impact of frost crack on European beech wood quality and the frost crack characteristics which affect wood quality. In order to do this, nineteen European beech trunks with frost crack have been studied. Each trunk has been cross-cut every 1 meter and the characteristics of frost crack and <b>frost</b> crack star-shaped <b>heart</b> have been measured in each cross-cut section. The defects which accompany frost crack have also been identified in each cross-cut section. Moreover, the possibility of determining these defects using the IML RESIF 500 â€“ S Resistograph has been tested. The research has emphasized the existence of statistical correlations between <b>frost</b> crack star-shaped <b>heart</b> expansion, <b>frost</b> crack rib prominence and frost crack length. These correlations are expressed by multiple linear regressions. The presence of defects which affect wood structure leading to a decrease in penetration resistance can be determined accurately with the resistograph. Decay (in frost cracks older than 8 years) and ring shake have been identified as the most frequent defects which accompany frost crack. The measurements made on the frost cracks studied have been gathered in a graph which shows frost crack impact on European beech wood quality. The results obtained lead to the improvement of the criteria of European beech wood quality assessment by expanding the already existent knowledge and by identifying new aspects which may complete standing wood quality determination and sorting methods...|$|R
50|$|Various sweets and goodies of Cookietown are {{preparing}} to crown their new Cookie Queen. A parade of potential candidates passes by, all based on various cakes and sweets. Far from the parade route, on what {{would appear to be}} {{the wrong side of the}} peppermint stick railroad tracks, a gingerbread drifter overhears an impoverished sugar cookie girl crying. Upon hearing that she can't enter the parade because she doesn't have any clothes that are nice enough to wear for it, he hurries to remedy this by concocting a dress of colored <b>frosting</b> and candy <b>hearts.</b> He covers her brown hair with golden taffy ringlets and adds a large violet bow to her dress as a finishing touch. Thus attired, she's entered as the final contestant in the parade: Miss Bonbon.|$|R
5000|$|As the X-Men and Dark X-Men {{prepared}} to face off, Emma revealed {{her role as}} a double agent, hardened through her discovery of Xavier's torture and Osborn's lack of concern for her people, defeating the Dark X-Men with Namor's assistance. It is primarily because of their growing mistrust of Osborn, with Namor's discoveries of the Sentry slaying the Atlantean terrorists but initially containing his rage [...] but later joining the Dark X-Men because of his romance with Emma Frost, who convinced him to join the Dark X-Men and psychically enters his mind, seeking to uncover the answers to some of her questions. Frost extended an invitation to Cloak and Dagger to join the true X-Men as they teleported to the newly created island base, Utopia. Both Frost and Namor's relationship with Osborn appear to be deeply strained at this point, with the former Green Goblin telling the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men to bring him Namor's head and Emma <b>Frost's</b> <b>heart</b> and that Summers sees them do it. Emma Frost and Namor both officially quit the Cabal, to be replaced with two new members, [...] "without the other remaining Cabal members having any say in the matter" [...] in Siege: The Cabal. However, an enraged and vengeful Osborn now unhesitantly strives to destroy Namor and his people as payback for his betrayal and joining the X-Men. Emma Frost promises to help him as he has helped her and her team, and the entire team of X-Men immediately work to investigate the Atlantean casualties, evacuate the survivors, and aid Namor against this mysterious new marine threat, the Marrina-Monster. Namor is forced to kill his former lover to stop her, but soon confronts Osborn over his controlling her to get revenge on Namor, vowing to kill him for his crimes. Though the actual confrontation is unseen, later Namor's name is seen crossed out on Osborn's List. Elsewhere, Namor and Reed Richards reach the tomb of Captain America, but discovers no dead body of their fallen comrade, to the shock of both men. Despite Doom's displeasure at Osborn's moving against Namor in Siege: The Cabal and his demanding Osborn stop his course of revenge (which led to the destruction of their own alliance), it is revealed that as [...] "every hero involved in the coming conflict desires vengeance on Doom for various reasons", Emma Frost and Namor, now both members in good standing of the X-Men, will also seek to make Doom pay for his treachery against them, in DoomWar, which indicates that for a variety of reasons, from Doom's capturing of the X-Man Storm to his deceptive attempt to convince Shuri that it was actually Namor who had assaulted her brother, has destroyed Doom's once-strong alliance with Namor. Furthermore, Doom has also claimed that he does not trust Namor, due to the two of them having clashed after they allied against common foes in the past, and should his alliance with Namor fail, with Namor turning on him, {{he would be willing to}} join forces with Attuma, an arch-enemy of Namor's, and one he believes could serve as a [...] "counter" [...] to Namor. At some point into the Dark Reign after the formation of the Cabal, though it is depicted that a large portion of Atlantean civilians still reside in the oceans under Namor's rule, Namor makes it clear that the Atlantean military is still residing in Latveria, when he proposes for an Atlantean mutant to move to Latveria with them, though no such military force was seen when Doom was assaulted by Morgan le Fay [...] or when the Asgardians moved into Latveria. However, Namor, after the events of Utopia, reveals to the X-Men upon Osborn's schemes causing hundreds if not thousands of his people to perish, that the Atlantean military force were far away, [...] "outside" [...] of Latveria, implying that though his alliance with Osborn has been destroyed, his alliance with Doctor Doom in some form still exists.|$|R
