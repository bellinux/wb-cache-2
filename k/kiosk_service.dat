40|$|Abstract A kiosk is a {{separate}} electronic computer terminal that allows the users to access information service. Traditional kiosks such as Automated Teller Machines (ATM) use software application with graphical user interfaces similar to normal computer system to allow users to accomplish their transaction tasks. However, this interaction mode has been proven {{to be difficult to}} use and not user-friendly for almost half of self-service users. A new type of interactive service kiosk which uses remote Video Mediated Communication (VMC) technology is to provide face-to-face talking with a customer servant to achieve the goal. Interactive VMC-based service kiosk is a tool that can be utilized in information technology field, bringing its customer convenience and close care to the virtual network. Differ from previous automated kiosk technologies which were concentrated on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), VMC-based kiosk puts emphasis on human-to-human interface technology. It’s not only providing easier user situation for personal services but also bringing benefits for service providers due to the customized service VMC-based service kiosks offered. VMC-based <b>kiosk</b> <b>service</b> utilizes cost-saving goals accomplished meanwhile gives stimulations to achieve a new scale of perspectives and possibilities in the right direction for the company. The target for the thesis is to exploit remote car rental service using VMC-based kiosk solution and analyze its attributions relate to another three service areas, banking, travelling and reception, in order to find out in what kinds of intended future services VMC technology can be beneficial. For the purpose, this case study uses qualitative approach with scenario-based prototyping and user testing. The test results were gathered in a real use environment where nine people used the prototype and were interviewed in situ. The use situations and interviews were video recorded and transcribed for qualitative content analysis. Based on testing participants’ experience and feedbacks, the three testing cases indicated that interactive kiosk services using VMC technology in general was considered positive and well accepted. This study also clearly showed that remote VMC-based <b>kiosk</b> <b>service</b> can be successfully transferred to different service areas where similar types of negotiation-based service processes are common. By VMC-based kiosks services, customers can be offered face-to-face talk as a natural communication mode which is an overwhelmed advantage over the traditional kiosk system. Participants in study testing also felt easy and convenient in VMC-based <b>kiosk</b> <b>service</b> use by these features. Meanwhile, more concerns of how to better use of VMC-based <b>kiosk</b> <b>service</b> in other perspectives are still required in the future...|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia until October 2010 {{the total}} number of petrol {{stations}} is 3182 units and 332 units are mini petrol stations. The term ‘petrol station’ used in Malaysia, which in other countries also known as petrol filling station, fueling station, garage, gasbar, gas station, petrol pump, petrol garage, petrol <b>kiosk,</b> <b>service</b> station, or servo, is a facility which sells fuel and usually lubricants for motor vehicles. The petrol filling station consists of a petrol bar with petrol outlets and typically with other associated facilities such as car washes, automotive services, convenience stores and food services. Service stations are open for long hours, keep cash on the premises and have minimal staffing at night, all of which may be contributing factors for robbery. Based on a researched its is stated that a petrol filling station ‘PFS is a hazardous facility and it needs special care in design, construction, installation and maintenance of its components so that they remain safe and secure throughout the life span of the station and do not cause explosion or other untoward incident. PFS are particularly hazardous workplaces. Hazard can be a situation, condition or environment which has a potential to cause harm, damage, human injury or ill health or combination of these. This study seeks the public perception on safety awareness of petrol station. The study involved a total of 100 respondents and among them are mostly users including OKUs, the staffs and several owners of the petrol stations. The result showed {{that the majority of the}} respondents visit petrol stations 4 times in week. Most of them used to go to the petrol station for refueling petrol, diesel, NGV or other petroleum products services. Majority of respondents agreed that the kiosk should be operating in 24 hours to ease public to use the facilities provided at petrol station and commented that the place to be added more safety features such as security guard and cctv in order to avoid robbery and snatching. The study also showed other results such as the level of knowledge of respondents about awareness of fire and explosion, accident and injury, and robbery, extortio...|$|E

The exhibition questioned issues surrounding the production, technology and marketing of commodities, but on a wider scale, how (and by whom) participation in consumer activity is structured or framed. Each artist and product designer was ‘paired’ {{in order to produce}} a new object, multiple or edition for exhibition. Via this cross-disciplinary collaboration, new working processes were to be found and explored, as well as allowing a re-appraisal of the conceptual elements of their practices. The resulting polymorphic objects (often neither product or artwork) were placed in an installation developed for the exhibition.

40|$|Self-service {{is seen as}} effective, and thus, {{pervasive}} in all walks of human life, where crowds of people independently use public or private services offered by local kiosks, the Internet, or mobile devices. There is growing interest in delivering complex information-intensive interactive <b>services</b> via <b>kiosks.</b> This complicated <b>service</b> design, along with multiple choice interfaces, has diversified customer groups and situations where people are dependent on available kiosks. This work introduces a new video-mediated communication (VMC) based kiosk system, which is a functional solution for the problem.

Eight case study examples of in store kiosks are analysed in using a framework that includes environment, task, audience, and technology.
