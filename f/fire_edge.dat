The dogs were beating about the glens and fields as usual, and had been for some time out of sight, when we heard a barking at some {{distance}} to the left. Shortly after we saw some sheep scampering on the hills, with the dogs after them. Scott applied to his lips the ivory whistle, always hanging at his button- hole, and soon called in the culprits, excepting Hamlet. Hastening up a bank which commanded a view along a fold or hollow of the hills, we beheld the sable prince of Denmark standing by the bleeding body of a sheep. The carcass was still warm, the throat bore marks of the fatal grip, and Hamlet's muzzle was stained with blood. Never was culprit more completely caught in flagrante delicto. I supposed the doom of poor Hamlet to be sealed; for no higher offence can be committed by a dog in a country abounding with sheep-walks. Scott, however, had a greater value for his dogs than for his sheep. They were his companions and friends. Hamlet, too, though an irregular, impertinent kind of youngster, was evidently a favorite. He would not for some time believe it could be he who had killed the sheep. It must have been some cur of the neighborhood, that had made off on our approach and left poor Hamlet in the lurch. Proofs, however, were too strong, and Hamlet was generally condemned. [...] "Well, well," [...] said Scott, [...] "it's partly my own fault. I have given up coursing for some time past, and the poor dog has had no chance after game to take the <b>fire</b> <b>edge</b> off of him If he was put after a hare occasionally he never would meddle with sheep." ...|$|E

A wide variety of flame or fire detectors are currently available in the market, but image based flame detection is getting of increased importance because of its easier and faster implementation and increased processing and analytical abilities. Research shows that the existing edge detection methods do not emphasize the continuity and clarity of the flame and fire images. In this proposed method, it identifies continuous and clear edges from the flame image, {{which can be used}} for various industrial and research purposes.

5000|$|The Citadel was to {{be reduced}} by a {{powerful}} siege battery constructed on a hill just to the south, Union battery number 24, intended to suppress the Confederate position by superior firepower. Union batteries were also constructed {{on the west bank}} of the Mississippi opposite Port Hudson, completely surrounding it with Union artillery batteries. Union forces also made raids on opposing trenches and batteries, to enhance their own trench lines or disable enemy batteries. Some of the 6th Michigan troops opposite the Citadel were armed with the [...]54 caliber (14 mm) breech-loading Merrill carbine, which gave them a rapid <b>fire</b> <b>edge</b> in trench raids. On June 26, a general bombardment from Union batteries and guns of the Union fleet began, disabling or suppressing what remained of the Confederate artillery. Along with the trenching operations, the Federals also constructed three mines underneath the opposing works, two of them directed against the Priest Cap, and one under the Citadel. After the mines were finished, chambers at the end of the mines would be loaded with powder, and exploded under the Confederate works, destroying them, and blowing gaps in the trench lines. At this point an infantry assault would be launched, hopefully overrunning the entire fortification.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of {{large-scale}} fires on essential pollinators, such as bees. A large wildfire occurred in the savannahs of Mburucuya National Park, Argentina, providing one year of both pre- and post-burn data. This allowed for an impact assessment of distance from <b>fire</b> <b>edge</b> using species diversity and guild characterization, based on nesting materials and body size, to examine bee community responses to fire. Our results generally agree with those of earlier smaller-scale fire impact studies upon bee communities: immediate declines in species richness and abundance but increases in diversity post-burn as well as similar responses from bee guilds based on nesting requirements. Our study suggests: (1) above-ground nesters are unable to colonize recently burned habitat as quickly as ground-nesters regardless of survival rates in situ, (2) ground-nesting bees, regardless of size, are least affected by distance from foraging or nesting resources, (3) patterns of fire impacts on bees become exacerbated near the middle of a large burn area, and (4) large-scale fires will have a greater impact upon above-ground nesters than do smaller-scale burns...|$|E

30|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} in {{the habitat}} {{is a consequence}} of fires as they burn across landscapes, resulting in patches of varied fire severity. We examined several spatial variables: patch squareness, total patch perimeter, and distance to <b>fire</b> <b>edge.</b> From the center point of each trapping area, we used GIS to determine the distance to the nearest unburned edge. To investigate how fire severity patch size diversity influences small mammal captures, we calculated total patch perimeter and patch squareness for each small mammal trapping area using FRAGSTATS (McGarigal et al. 2002) and GIS. Total patch perimeter is a measure of patch heterogeneity calculated by summing the perimeter of each fire severity patch contained within the boundaries of the trapping area. Because all of the small mammal trapping sites were equal in size, the site with the highest total patch perimeter indicates a site with more patches of differing fire severities, and therefore a site with higher burn heterogeneity. Patch squareness describes patch shape complexity and is an index that ranges from 0 (square, less edge, minimum complexity) to 1 (least squarelike, more edge, high complexity) (Frohn 1998). Unlike contagion and fractal dimension, total patch perimeter and patch squareness are optimized for use with data arranged in rasters, as with Landsat data (Frohn 1998).|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{describing}} {{the processes of}} propagation and elimination of wildfires {{on the basis of}} agent-based modeling is proposed. The main structural units of the creation of such models are the classes of active objects (agents). Agent approach, combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can effectively describe the interaction {{of a large number of}} participants in the process to combat wildfires: fire spreading, fire crews, mechanization, aerial means and other. In this paper we propose a multi-agent model to predict the spread of wildfire edge and simulate the direct method of extinguishing a ground fire with non-mechanized crews. The model consist with two classes of agents, designated A and B. The burning <b>fire</b> <b>edge</b> is represented as a chain of A-agents, each of which simulates the burning of an elementary portion of vegetation fuel. Fire front movement (moving the A-agent) described by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with using the indicatrises of normal front rate of spread (figurotris). The configuration of the front calculated on basis the algorithm of mobile grids. Agents other type, B-agents, described extinguishing process; they move to the agents of A type and act on them, reducing the combustion intensity to zero. Modeling system presented as two-level coloured nested Petri Net, which describes the agents’ interaction semantics. This model is implemented as a GIS-oriented software system that can be useful both in the fire fighting management as well as in staff training tactics to fighting wildfires.

30|$|Because we {{estimated}} the landscape-level habitat variables at different scales, we applied non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) {{to assess the}} orientation of the 10 burned sites in relation to each other in terms of the habitat variables. The NMDS uses the rank order of Sørenson distances (Sørenson 1948, Bray and Curtis 1957) to establish similarities between sites and the environmental variables measured at each site. The sites closest together in NMDS space share the most similarities in the measured environmental variables. The axes of the NMDS ordination represent gradients that are a composite function of the variables. The dissimilarity between the distribution of data points in the original data space and the reduced ordination data space is quantified as “stress,” which scales from 0 to 100; values < 15 may be interpreted as “quite satisfactory” (McCune and Grace 2002). We selected the dimensionality of the NMDS ordination using scree plots, which depict how stress decreases with increasing dimensions. We used Pearson’s coefficient of determination to quantify the proportion of variation (fit between the original data space and the distance in the ordination) represented by each composite axis. To reduce skew, we transformed the data using either arcsine-square root (proportional data; canopy closure, oak cover, shrub cover, and patch squareness) or natural logarithm (distance variables; distance to <b>fire</b> <b>edge,</b> and total fire severity patch perimeter). We did not transform the fire severity index as it was already normally distributed. To regulate differences in scale, we adjusted all values to the standard deviation of the mean for each variable. We used PC-ORD (MjM software design, [URL] to perform the NMDS according to guidelines outlined by McCune and Grace (2002).|$|E

The algorithm uses Canny’s edge detection with Gaussian filter for detecting the edges of the flame/fire. This is an improved method over all the existing ones.

Some research works shows that the existing methods do not emphasize the continuity and clarity of the flame and <b>fire</b> <b>edges.</b> The proposed method identifies the continuous and clear edges of the flame/fire and produces the alarms accordingly. This process detects outlines of an object and boundaries between objects and the background in the image.

30|$|To map the {{perimeter}} of a wildfire accurately, either the pilot of the helicopter or ground personnel must follow the burning edge exactly using a GPS. This is difficult for several reasons. For the pilot, the difficulty lies in {{the need to maintain}} a safe flying altitude and dealing with low visibility as a result of smoke, heavy vegetation cover, and shadow effects. If aerial reconnaissance is not used, ground-based mapping of the <b>fire</b> <b>edge</b> is difficult due to the challenges of following burned edges in rough terrain and the non-uniform manner in which wildfires burn across the landscape. Due to these challenges, two potential sources of mapping error arise: detection and delineation of unburned islands, and accurate delineation of fire boundaries. First, on most wildfires there are islands of unburned vegetation scattered throughout the burned area, ranging from only a few isolated trees to areas encompassing hundreds of hectares. These islands are often not mapped because of safety concerns or the sheer impracticality of delineating numerous small patches by helicopter or on the ground (see Figure 3 as an example). Additionally, there is inherent subjectivity in deciding the minimum mapping unit for delineating unburned islands of various sizes. The second general source of error concerns mapping of the fire perimeter. Delineation of the burn perimeter is highly subjective since this boundary is itself a patchy, convoluted “fuzzy edge” that is difficult to define when on the ground, let alone flying overhead in a helicopter. Safety concerns may also contribute to boundary mapping error since in extreme terrain it can be unsafe to stick to the true fire perimeter, and more prudent to include some unburned areas by taking a different access route.|$|E
40|$|Understanding post fire {{white spruce}} {{recruitment}} and natural regeneration in mixed aspen spruce {{stands in the}} boreal forests of Northeast British Columbia has proved difficult. Proximity to seed source is generally considered {{to have one of}} the greatest influences on natural regeneration of these forests following disturbance by fire. In order to increase our understanding of the dynamics of recruitment following fire, we measured white spruce regeneration within a 59 year old aspen spruce stand in Northeast BC. One meter wide linear transects, 75 m in length, were established perpendicular to the forest edge seed source: three transects were oriented to the southeast and three were oriented to the west (into prevailing wind). The number of white spruce encountered along transects were counted at one meter intervals along each transect. Remnants and co-dominant spruce trees producing seed within a tree length distance (25 m) of transects were identified to establish internal stand seed sources. No post fire internal spruce seed sources were detected near transects. White spruce regeneration declined with distance from the <b>fire</b> <b>edge</b> for both sampling orientations. Seedling recruitment was negatively correlated to the direction of the prevailing winds. This resulted in more spruce recruitment on {{the eastern edge of the}} stand than the western. However remnants of the original stand or germinant seedlings that maintained co-dominance in the regenerating stand may have contributed spruce seed resulting in internal recruitment. This would result in isolated internal patches of white spruce with densities similar to those found at the forest edge. White spruce seed sources external and internal to the regenerating spruce aspen stand contribute to observed stand dynamics and succession processes. The recruitment and regeneration of spruce in these stands determines the complex nature (species and structural), spatially and temporally, of mixed aspen white spruce stands in Northeast BC...|$|E

30|$|Remotely sensed data {{analysis}} of 53 wildfires showed that fire perimeter mapping error can be significant using field and helicopter based methods, {{and that the}} error of commission is likely the primary contributor to overall error. The error of commission increased significantly with increased terrain complexity at all spatial scales, suggesting that land managers have difficulty mapping <b>fire</b> <b>edges</b> correctly in the roughest terrain, and inadvertently overestimate the area burned. These errors are problematic for land managers and researchers who use published fire perimeters and area burned databases (including the federal historic wildland fire database) for research and information to support land management applications.

30|$|Observational studies such as {{this one}} can improve {{understanding}} of complex ecological processes relevant to large landscapes (Guthery 2008). The five questions above are addressed by contrasting the current rates of burning with contemporary estimates of historical burning, by comparing observed fires to fires randomly located on a neutral landscape, and by quantifying how often new fires breach existing <b>fire</b> <b>edges.</b> The three wilderness areas analyzed encompass an area of 49 000 km 2 in the northern Rocky Mountains. We expected differences in fire-on-fire interaction characteristics among the three wilderness areas given observed variability in topographic orientation, vegetative composition, and climatic characteristics. The wilderness areas are relatively unaffected by human influences, although fire suppression continues to be practiced in them from time to time. Given long-standing practices of allowing fire to burn for resource benefit, however, the wilderness areas provide some of the best available baselines for observing what is natural. The availability of MTBS data, documented fire history studies, and variability in physiographic characteristics were additional considerations in site selection. The MTBS data provide an unprecedented ability to assess fire history systematically across large land areas, and few studies have focused on re-burn and edge-characteristics of fire interactions. A better understanding of fire-on-fire interactions is important to land managers and scientists alike.|$|R
30|$|The {{locations}} and amounts of Total Available Edge that were encountered by subsequent fires were thus identified, resulting in polylines depicting the total Edge Encountered {{on an annual}} basis. These common boundaries were analyzed {{to determine how much}} of the previous <b>fire</b> <b>edges</b> were shared by subsequent fires (e.g., stopped the fire; Length Shared) versus how much was breached by subsequent fires (e.g., led to re-burns; Length Breached), regardless of the actual age of the perimeter. Finally, those areas in which the Edge Encountered polylines were overlapped by fire intersections (i.e., re-burned areas) were identified. These locations were attributed as Length Breached; locations at which the Edge Encountered polylines did not overlap with fire intersections represented Length Shared. Although the cumulative outer extent could span many years, with different segments of the perimeter being different ages, the different ages of the outer extent were not considered. The purpose of this exercise was to identify the locations of edges and re-burns and to quantify the Total Available Edge, the total Length Encountered, the total amount of previously created perimeter that stopped new fires, and the total amount of edge that was breached. Total length of Edge Encountered, Edge Shared, and Edge Breached were summarized for each study area by year and over the entire period.|$|R
