25|$|Electional astrology, {{also known}} as event astrology, is a branch found in most traditions of astrology in which a {{practitioner}} decides the most appropriate time for an event based on the astrological auspiciousness of that time. It is distinct from <b>horary</b> <b>astrology</b> because, while horary astrologers seek to find {{the answer to a}} question based on the time the question was asked, electional astrologers seek to find a period of time which will result in the most preferable outcome for the event being planned.|$|E

25|$|During {{the advance}} of Islamic science some of the {{practices}} of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna.

Such refutations mainly concerned 'judicial branches' (such as <b>horary</b> <b>astrology),</b> rather than the more 'natural branches' such as medical and meteorological astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.|$|E

As an example, let's say we ask a question about your husband, he'd be the 7th house since that's the house of partnerships and he's obviously your partner. What we would do is turn the chart so the 7th house now becomes the first house, kind of like your husband is the first house and the person in charge.|$|R
50|$|A planet {{can gain}} {{accidental}} dignity {{through a number}} of ways, but most often it is gained when the planet is found on an angle (Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, IC), being direct, swift in motion, free from combustion or being Cazimi, in a beneficial aspect to a fortunate planet or conjunct a fixed star of a fortunate nature. Essential and accidental dignity have particular importance in some branches of <b>astrology,</b> such as <b>horary</b> and electional <b>astrology.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lilly's most {{comprehensive}} {{book was published}} in 1647 and was entitled Christian Astrology. It is so large that it came in three separate volumes in modern times, and it remains popular even today and has never gone totally out-of-print. It {{is considered one of}} the classic texts for the study of traditional astrology from the Middle Ages, in particular <b>horary</b> <b>astrology,</b> which is mainly concerned with predicting future events or investigating unknown elements of current affairs, based on an astrological chart cast for the time a particular question is asked of the astrologer. Worked examples of horary charts are found in Volume 2 of Christian Astrology.|$|E

5|$|In India, {{there is}} a {{long-established}} and widespread belief in astrology. It is commonly used for daily life, particularly in matters concerning marriage and career, and makes extensive use of electional, <b>horary</b> and karmic <b>astrology.</b> Indian politics have also been influenced by astrology. It is still considered {{a branch of the}} Vedanga. In 2001, Indian scientists and politicians debated and critiqued a proposal to use state money to fund research into astrology, resulting in permission for Indian universities to offer courses in Vedic astrology.|$|R
50|$|A Chart Ruler {{refers to}} the astrological {{planetary}} body that rules the zoidion (zodiac sign) of the ascendant in a given horoscope. For example, if a horoscope has Cancer rising on the ascendant, the Moon is the chart ruler. In Natal astrology, astrologers consider the house and sign placement of this planet to be of special importance in the shaping of a persons identity. In Mundane, <b>Horary</b> and Electional <b>astrology</b> the ruler of the ascendant {{might not be as}} important as the ruler of the house most involved with the question asked if it is different from things related to the ascendant.|$|R

5000|$|Barclay wrote <b>Horary</b> <b>Astrology</b> Rediscovered (published in 1990), {{which is}} a {{detailed}} description of the theory, practice and history of <b>horary</b> <b>astrology.</b> The book included material from her correspondence course and in 1991 received the Professional Astrologers Inc.

50|$|<b>Horary</b> <b>astrology</b> {{has its own}} strict system. The {{position}} of and aspects to the moon are of prime importance.

Planetary aspects to the house cusps are considered more important than in other branches of astrology (although it is the planetary rulers of the houses in question that take precedence in analysis). Other key elements used in <b>horary</b> <b>astrology</b> include the lunar nodes, the planetary antiscia, the fixed stars and the Arabic parts.|$|E

50|$|Recently, in {{the late}} 20th century, some astrologers began to extend {{the use of the}} word katarche to interrogations or <b>horary</b> <b>astrology,</b> where a chart is cast for the moment that a {{question}} is posed to an astrologer. According to this modern interpretation there is a fluid connection between the notions of electional and <b>horary</b> <b>astrology.</b> This view, which is primarily advocated by Geoffrey Cornelius, is that the origins of the concept and core meaning of the term katarche lie in the ritual, sacrificial and divinitory connotations of the term, and that the later application of the term in the Hellenistic and Roman periods strictly to elections and inceptions were a result of some sort of decay in the understanding of the term.|$|E

50|$|Tajika Neelakanthi is a {{treatise}} on the predictive part of Hindu astrology written in Sanskrit Slokas by the celebrated authority on Tajika shastra, Neelakantha, son of Ananta Deva, {{on the basis}} of many earlier works of Samar Singh and others.

50|$|The {{houses in}} <b>horary</b> <b>astrology</b> charts {{mean the same}} as in the natal chart.

Again, the meaning of each house is the same whether you're doing horary, natal or electional astrology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Horary</b> <b>astrology</b> is {{a method}} by which an astrologer {{attempts}} to answer a specific question by constructing a horoscope for the exact time and place at which the question was asked.

5000|$|A unique Vedic {{system is}} {{followed}} in Muhurtha Astrology, <b>Horary</b> <b>Astrology</b> and predictive astrology, which envisages grouping of Nakshtaras (Stars) into nine sub-groups.

5000|$|Prasna Tantra is {{a famous}} work of Neelakantha on <b>Horary</b> <b>astrology.</b> Neelakantha Daivagnya, {{the author of}} Tajika Neelakanthi was the {{minister}} and court astrologer of Mughal Emperor Jalaluddin Akbar. Prasna Tantra {{is based on the}} Tajika system of prognostication. It comprises 430 slokas divided into four chapters, and is written in the usual Sanskrit Sloka - format. It is believed that this work, which is compact and comprehensive, proven and applicable to modern conditions, is the Third Tantra or division of Neelakantha’s larger work, Tajika Neelakanthi. Prasna Tantra is divided into four chapters, viz - Prasna Vichara (preliminaries), Bhava Prasna (questions bearing on different houses), Vishesha Prasna (special questions) and Prakirnakadhyaya (concluding remarks). The aspects considered by this work are those of the Tajika system, an aspect by itself has no orb but planets have orbs of operation; Yogas in this system arise on the basis of applying and separating aspects, the closer the yoga (Ithsala etc.,), the more certain will be the results. The rules and methods initiated by this text have found favour with astrologers since the time it was written and came to light around 1580 A.D. [...] Prasna Tantra by Neelakantha and Daivagya Vallabha of Varahamihira are a must to cover Prasna or <b>Horary</b> <b>astrology.</b>|$|E

Prasna Marga also uses many techniques, like Navams-Navams, Navams-Dvadasams, etc. which are not used by anyone in practice, but were used earlier.|$|E
