5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war they were in a piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness and discomfort, and their <b>encumbrance</b> to motor cars in the city centre. Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their first route.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothetical}} continuation {{and expansion}} of the Angevin Empire over several centuries {{has been the subject}} of several tales of alternate history. Historically, both English and French historians had viewed the juxtaposition of England and French lands under Angevin control as something of an aberration and an offence to national identity. To English historians the lands in France were an <b>encumbrance,</b> while French historians considered the union to be an English empire.|$|E

However, AFFCO went to court to enforce a 20-year <b>encumbrance</b> which restricts meat processing and associated activities on the site. It succeeded in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in preventing the new plant from opening, although an ANZCO subsidiary was allowed to continue using freezer and coolstore facilities there. The two companies are said to have reached an agreement. ANZCO now operates from the site, and has become one of the major employers in the township.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 {{the number}} of parishioners was about 600. The church {{property}} {{at that time was}} valued at $445,000, with $200,000 <b>encumbrance.</b> The basement of the church was used by the Slovenian Catholics, who were attended by a Franciscan from Brooklyn. The societies in the parish were: Rosary, Corpus Christi, Agony of Our Lord, Confraternity of the Sacred Heart, four sodalities of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Conference of St. Vincent de Paul Society, St. Nicholas' and St. Aloysius' societies, and the St. Nicholas' School Association. The school had an attendance of 155 boys and 210 girls, and was taught by six Sisters of St. Dominic.|$|E

25|$|To break through, {{armoured}} {{forces would}} attack an opposing defensive line frontally, supported by motorised infantry, artillery fire and aerial bombardment, {{to create a}} breach. Tanks and other motorised units could {{break out of the}} fortified zone without the <b>encumbrance</b> of slow-moving infantry moving on foot. Air forces tried to gain air superiority by attacking opposing aircraft on the ground, bombing airfields and communications and seeking tactically advantageous positions from which to destroy them in the air. Schwerpunktbildung enabled the attacker to win numerical superiority at the point of main effort, which in turn gave the attacker tactical and operational superiority, even though the attacker may be numerically and strategically inferior in general.|$|E
25|$|Recruits are to {{be taught}} the art of {{throwing}} stones both with the hand and sling. The inhabitants of the Balearic Islands {{are said to have}} been the inventors of slings, and to have managed them with surprising dexterity, owing to the manner of bringing up their children. The children were not allowed to have their food by their mothers till they had first struck it with their sling. Soldiers, notwithstanding their defensive armour, are often more annoyed by the round stones from the sling than by all the arrows of the enemy. Stones kill without mangling the body, and the contusion is mortal without loss of blood. It is universally known the ancients employed slingers in all their engagements. There is the greater reason for instructing all troops, without exception, in this exercise, as the sling cannot be reckoned any <b>encumbrance,</b> and often is of the greatest service, especially when they are obliged to engage in stony places, to defend a mountain or an eminence, or to repulse an enemy at the attack of a castle or city.|$|E

[...] The outcome of the commission, supported by Eggleston, allowed for greater involvement in regard to unemployment insurance and pensions from the federal government. During this time he liaised with notable figures including Newton Rowell, James McGregor Stewart and Henry Angus (all of whom were also members of the venture).|$|E

[...] Along with the eagle, which has the size of the half dollar, we would recommend the double eagle, which [...] of the size of our silver dollar, [...] would contain the value of twenty." [...] Others perceived a need for a large U.S. gold coin to be used in international transactions—American merchants sometimes used high-denomination Latin American gold coins for that purpose.|$|E

However, he also considered, mistakenly, that [...] "there is nothing on the West Coast worth incurring the expense of exploring." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 May 1973 {{elections}} to Dundee City Council commenced, with the Labour Party of Scotland fielding {{a total of}} nine candidates in eight of the city's 12 wards. McLean stood in the Downfield area and returned the party's best result, capturing 242 ballots and 6.1% of the vote; D. McGarry, one of two party candidates in Camperdown, produced the weakest, collecting 1.6% with 123 votes. None of the party's candidates were elected, leading to its quiet dissolution 22 days later. Such {{a decision was made}} in conjunction with the previously unaffiliated Glasgow party so that [...] "the national movement could show a united front"; commentators Andrew Murray Scott and Iain MacLeay simply surmise [...] "either group was successful". Dissolved by a motion with seven for and just one against, most of their members duly returned to the SNP, some becoming involved with the party's pirate station Radio Free Scotland. Without the <b>encumbrance</b> of the minor Dundee group, Gordon Wilson was returned as Member of Parliament for Dundee East in February's general election of the following year, concurrently serving as Depute Leader of his party. Wilson later served as Leader of the SNP from 1979 to 1990, succeeding William Wolfe.|$|E
