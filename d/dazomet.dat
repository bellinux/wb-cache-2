50|$|<b>Dazomet</b> is a {{chemical}} {{used to kill}} pests that inhibit plant growth through gaseous degradation. <b>Dazomet</b> {{is used as a}} soil sterilant on a variety of sites such as golf courses, nurseries, turf sites, and potting soils. <b>Dazomet</b> is used for soil sterilization as an alternative to methyl bromide. Although less effective it is still used to kill pests because of its comparatively lower toxicity. <b>Dazomet</b> is applied to wet soil, which causes <b>dazomet</b> itself to decompose into a gaseous form, which is what actively controls pests. The decomposition of <b>dazomet</b> releases methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) a gas toxic to pests that would prevent or kill plant growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dazomet</b> is irritating to {{the eyes}} and its {{degradation}} product, MITC, is a dermal sensitizer. <b>Dazomet</b> is very toxic to aquatic organisms, and also acutely toxic to mammals. Exposure to <b>dazomet</b> can occur through several means; interaction with unincorporated granules, inhalation of it decomposition product, MITC, and/or water runoff.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dazomet</b> is {{synthesized}} from {{carbon disulfide}} (CS2) and diluted methylamine (CH3NH2).

50|$|Since P. ramorum can {{persist for}} an {{undetermined}} {{period of time}} within the soil profile, management programs in nurseries should also deal with delineating the pathogen’s distribution in nursery soil and eliminating it from infested areas. A variety of chemical options has been tested for soil disinfestation, including such chemicals as chloropicrin, metham sodium, iodomethane, and <b>dazomet.</b> Lab tests indicated {{that all of these}} chemicals were effective when applied to infested soil in glass jars. Additionally, tests on volunteer nurseries with infested soil demonstrated that <b>dazomet</b> (trade name Basamid) fumigation followed by a 14-day tarping period successfully removed P. ramorum from the soil profile. Other soil disinfestation practices under investigation, or in which interest has been expressed, include steam sterilization, solarization, and paving of infested areas.|$|E
5000|$|Ambrose Rajamannan was the {{inventor}} of the novel process of continuously and instantaneously sterilizing soil using a water-activated fumigant. <b>Dazomet</b> is one water-activated fumigant that could be used.

5000|$|Preplant: Preplant {{herbicides}} are nonselective herbicides {{applied to}} soil before planting. Some preplant herbicides may be mechanically {{incorporated into the}} soil. The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through photodecomposition and/or volatility. The herbicides kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone. Volatile herbicides have to {{be incorporated into the}} soil before planting the pasture. Agricultural crops grown in soil treated with a preplant herbicide include tomatoes, corn, soybeans and strawberries. Soil fumigants like metam-sodium and <b>dazomet</b> are in use as preplant herbicides.|$|E
50|$|Cases of {{dermatitis}} {{caused by}} pesticide exposures, tabulated by the Division of Dermatology, Saku Central Hospital, Japan, from 1975 to 2000 are described. Dermatitis cases gradually decreased from 1975 to 2000, presumably accelerated by the phase-out of dermatitis-causing pesticides, including difolatan fungicide and salithion, an organophosphorous insecticide. Cases of chronic and solar dermatitides gradually decreased, {{which may be}} explained by reductions in the use of allergenic or photosensitive sulfur agents and organophosphates. However, the ratios of chemical burns from irritant pesticides—calcium polysulfide, <b>dazomet,</b> methyl bromide, chlorpicrin, paraqat/diquat, organophosphorus, quintozene, and glyphosate—rose in those years. Chemical burns from calcium polysulfide were responsible for most of the severe cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of soil solarization (SS), {{one of the}} most promising techniques for the control of soilborne pathogens, is seriously limited by the drawback regarding the disposal of the used plastic materials. A possible solution to this problem is the use of biodegradable plastics. The aim of this study was to make comparisons between the impact of SS performed with biodegradable materials and that of SS with plastic films and other pest management techniques (i. e. organic matter amendment, calcium cyanamide and <b>Dazomet</b> fungicide application) on crop productivity, soilborne disease incidence, weed suppression, and soil chemical (total N, NH 4 -N, nitrate, available phosphorus, organic matter, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate) and microbial (cultivable Pseudomonas, DGGE fingerprinting of bacterial 16 S- and fungal 28 S rRNA gene fragments from total soil community DNA) parameters. We carried out field experiments in two types of soil with different textures (clay and sand) artificially inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (vs. tomato) and Sclerotinia minor (vs. lettuce). The temperature of soils covered with solarizing materials was always higher than that of bare soils, but plastic cover was more effective and consistent in rising soil temperature compared to biodegradable materials. Plant growth promotion by SS was limited, especially compared to <b>Dazomet</b> and organic matter applications, and a positive effect was observed only for lettuce in the clay soil. Differently, both plastic and biodegradable solarizing materials were effective in reducing lettuce drop caused by S. minor. Weed development was significantly suppressed by <b>Dazomet</b> application and SS with plastic film, while control with biodegradable materials was limited. SS had a variable and limited effect on chemical and microbial parameters, with a general tendency to reduce richness of bacteria and fungi. <b>Dazomet</b> caused the most pronounced reduction of the microbial community diversity in both soil types and a significant stimulation of the fluorescent Pseudomonas group. Organic amendment significantly enhanced the organic matter content, the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate and the Pseudomonas population. Among all measured soil parameters, the size of the fluorescent Pseudomonas population emerged as the most important factor affecting crop productivity. The results of this experimentation show the potential of using biodegradable solarizing materials in place of plastic films, but also indicate the need for improving their properties to obtain performances comparable to those of other pest management techniques...|$|E

Depending on circumstances related to environmental conditions, supplies, available infrastructure and other factors, a number of MB alternatives are being used {{around the world to}} grow flowers including steam, solarization, biocontrol, substrates, organic amendments, crop rotation, resistant varieties, biofumigation, metam-sodium, 1, 3 -dichloropropene, <b>dazomet</b> and chloropicrin.

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing or fracking has enabled {{the recovery of}} natural gas from low permeable shale formations. In addition to water, these fracking fluids employ proppants and up to 38 different chemical additives to improve {{the efficiency of the}} process. One important class of additives used in hydraulic fracturing is biocides. When applied appropriately, they limit the growth of harmful microorganisms within the well, saving energy producers 4. 5 billion dollars each year. However, biocides or their harmful daughter products may return to the surface in produced water, which must then be appropriately stored, treated and disposed of. Little is known about the effect of mineral-fluid interactions on the fate of the biocides employed in hydraulic fracturing. In this study, we employed laboratory experiments to determine changes in the persistence and products of these biocides under controlled environments. While many minerals are present in shale formations, pyrite, FeS 2 (s) is particularly interesting because of its prevalence and reactivity. The FeII groups on the face of pyrite may be oxidized to form FeIII phases. Both of these surfaces {{have been shown to be}} reactive with organic compounds. Chlorinated compounds undergo redox reactions at the pyrite-fluid interface, and sulfur-containing compounds undergo exceptionally strong sorption to both pristine and oxidized pyrite. This mineral may significantly influence the degradation of biocides in the Marcellus Shale. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to understand the effect of pyrite on biocide reactivity in hydraulic fracturing, focusing on the influence of pyrite on specific functional groups. The first specific objective was to demonstrate the effect of pyrite and pyrite reaction products on the degradation of the bromine-containing biocide, DBNPA. On the addition of pyrite to DBNPA, degradation rates of the doubly brominated compound were found to increase significantly. DBNPA is proposed to undergo redox reactions with the pyrite surface, accepting two-electrons from pyrite, and thus becoming reduced. The primary product is the monobrominated analogue of DBNPA, 2 -monobromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide (or MBNPA). The surface area-normalized first-order initial degradation rate constant was found to be 5. 1 L. m- 2 day- 1. It was also determined that the dissolution and oxidation products of pyrite, FeII, S 2 O 32 - and SO 42 - are unlikely to contribute to the reduction of the biocide. Taken together, the results illustrate that a surface reaction with pyrite has the ability to reduce the persistence of DBNPA, and as a consequence change the distribution of its reaction products. The second objective was to quantify the influence of water chemistry and interactions with pyrite on the degradation of the sulfur-containing biocide. <b>Dazomet</b> readily hydrolyzes in water due to the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide (OH-) anions. Thus the half-life of <b>dazomet</b> during the shut-in phase of hydraulic fracturing will decrease with increasing pH: 8. 5 hours at pH 4. 1 to 3. 4 hours at pH 8. 2. <b>Dazomet</b> degradation was rapidly accelerated upon exposure to the oxidized pyrite surface, reacting five times faster than hydrolysis in the absence of pyrite at a similar pH. The products measured were identical to those identified on hydrolysis (methyl isothiocyanate and formaldehyde) and no dissolved iron was detected in solutions. This suggests that the dithiocarbamate group in <b>dazomet</b> was able to chemisorb onto the oxidized pyrite surface, shifting the electron density of the molecule which resulted in accelerated hydrolysis of the biocide. The third objective explored the reactivity of various biocide functional groups due to the addition of pyrite. Several elimination mechanisms were identified, and tied to the reactivity of the specific functional group involved. The addition of pyrite led to accelerated degradation of dibromodicyanobutane. This is because the bromine (-Br) group is easily reduced. For methylene bis(thiocyanate), hydrolysis was a noteworthy elimination mechanism since the thiocyanate (-SCN) functionality is a good leaving group. Benzisothiazolinone and methyl isothiazolinone were stable at low pH due to the stabilizing donor-acceptor interactions between the organic biocides’ carbonyl (–C=O) groups and salts in the solution. This body of work has illustrated that pristine pyrite can undergo redox reactions with brominated biocides used in hydraulic fracturing, reducing their persistence and altering the product distribution. This will change the efficacy and the risks associated with the use of these biocides in shales containing pyrite, particularly at lower pH where organic compounds are more stable to hydrolysis. However, at higher pH hydrolysis becomes more important, and additional studies will need to be conducted to investigate the pyrite contribution under these conditions. Conversely, the FeIII surface groups on oxidized pyrite can catalyze the hydrolysis of <b>dazomet</b> and may do so for other labile, sulfur-containing biocides as well. Overall, this research has shown that the physicochemical properties (such as the acid dissociation constant and the standard reduction potential) that govern the environmental reactivity of a molecule can be used to anticipate its reactivity in hydraulic fracturing...|$|E
