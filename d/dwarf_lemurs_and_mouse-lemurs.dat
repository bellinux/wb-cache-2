5000|$|Family Cheirogaleidae: <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse-lemurs</b> (34 species) ...|$|E
5|$|Family Cheirogaleidae {{consists}} of the mouse lemurs (smallest of all primates), the <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> the fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> their allies. There are 37extant species.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Allocebus). Both <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} only known to exist from one museum {{specimen}} from Ambositra, north of Fianarantsoa in east-central Madagascar. As of 2010, no {{studies in the}} wild have been conducted of the lesser iron-gray <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> <b>and</b> it is unknown whether it still survives in this region. There are no reports of it being kept in captivity.|$|R
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs,</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> fork-marked <b>lemurs),</b> but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|R
50|$|Three {{species of}} lemurs {{can be found}} in this reserve Microcebus rufus, <b>Dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus sp.) <b>and</b> Eulemur fulvus fulvus.|$|R
5|$|After the {{offspring}} are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either {{cling to the}} mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs),</b> bamboo <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> ruffed <b>lemurs.</b> In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> <b>and</b> ruffed <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Sensory specializations, {{particularly}} in the visual system, have been crucial factors {{in the evolution of}} brain and behavior in primates (Allman, 2000). The entire output of the retina is channeled through the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve connecting the eye and brain. We have mapped the density of retinal ganglion cells in flattened retinal whole mounts in the <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> Cheirogaleus medius, <b>and</b> the Philippine tarsier, Tarsius syrichta. Figure 1 illustrates these maps, which reveal that the ganglion cell density is much lower throughout the retina in <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> than in the tarsier. In Figure 2, the data for cross sections near the horizontal meridian are depicted for the <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> <b>and</b> tarsier from our data compared with similar cross sections from the galago (DeBruyn et al., 1980) <b>and</b> mouse <b>lemur</b> (Dkhissi-Benyahya et al, 2001). These data indicate that the retinal ganglion cell densities as a function of eccentricity are similar in tarsier, galago <b>and</b> mouse <b>lemur,</b> <b>and</b> that the ganglion cell densities in <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> are much lower, particularly {{near the center of the}} retina. In Figure 3, we have added comparable cross sectional data for the diurnal rhesus macaque to illustrate the enormous increase in ganglion cell density associated with higher acuity in diurna...|$|R
5000|$|The hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> {{was first}} {{placed in the}} genus Cheirogaleus (<b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs)</b> in 1875 <b>and</b> was later found to have closer affinities with Microcebus. However, its {{dentition}} and cranium structure were held sufficiently distinct to merit elevation to its own genus, Allocebus.|$|R
500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform taxa, such as cheirogaleid lemurs (particularly fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> the hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur)</b> <b>and</b> galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered [...] "primitive" [...] forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors. Also, strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized, based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapis). [...] If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on {{the shape of the}} anterior dentition, then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus Callithrix (a type of marmoset).|$|R
5000|$|The Lavasoa <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the furry-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> by its wider ears and smaller head. [...] It can {{be distinguished}} from its closest relative, Cheirogaleus sp. Ranomafana Andrambovato, by these two traits plus a shorter tail. The coloration patterns are very similar between all three species. This coloration pattern contrasts with Lavasoa <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur's</b> closest geographic neighbors, the greater <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (C. major) <b>and</b> the fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (C. medius).|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> the Lavasoa <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> is nocturnal <b>and</b> arboreal, {{living in}} the upper canopy of the forest. During the dry winter, they {{hibernate}} for several months. Little is known about their behavior because they are primarily active during the rainy season, at which time the forests become challenging for scientists to reach.|$|R
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> bamboo <b>lemurs</b> (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|R
5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) {{use their}} toothcombs {{to scoop up}} fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Allocebus), <b>and</b> galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{restricted}} to the reserve of Andohahela and the area of Sainte Luce. Further studies are required to determine the exact distribution range and especially the limits with its sister species Peyrieras' woolly lemur (A. peyrierasi). In southeastern littoral forests, sympatric lemur species of Avahi meridionalis are the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus), the greater <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus major), the fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> Cheirogaleus medius <b>and</b> the collared brown lemur (Eulemur collaris) in Sainte Luce Forest, and the southern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis) in Mandena Forest.|$|R
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss <b>and</b> conserve energy. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|R
50|$|The nocturnal lemurs that {{reside in}} the reserve include the Fat Tailed <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus medius), Mouse <b>Lemur</b> <b>and</b> Southern Woolly <b>Lemur</b> (Avahi meridionalis).|$|R
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> 9–10weeks in <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> the aye-aye usually have one offspring. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>and</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed <b>lemur</b> <b>and</b> some Eulemur.|$|R
50|$|The Forest Station {{is home to}} {{an extreme}} variety of biodiversity. There are at least seven groups of Indri indri within the reserve, {{two of which are}} habituated to people and are {{commonly}} seen by tourists. There are also mouse <b>lemurs,</b> hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> aye-aye, common brown lemurs, gray gentle <b>lemur,</b> <b>and</b> small-toothed sportive <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
500|$|Though giant mouse lemurs are {{relatively}} small cheirogaleids, they are {{more than three times}} larger than the smallest members of the family, the mouse lemurs. Their body weight averages [...] At around , their bushy and long tail is longer than their head-body length, which averages [...] Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs (with an intermembral index of 70), a trait shared with mouse lemurs. The skull {{is similar to that of}} <b>dwarf</b> <b>and</b> mouse <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> the auditory bullae are small.|$|R
500|$|As {{its name}} implies, the gray mouse lemur is a lemur, {{a type of}} primate, and belongs to the {{suborder}} Strepsirrhini and infraorder Lemuriformes. [...] Within Lemuriformes, {{it belongs to the}} family Cheirogaleidae, which contains the mouse <b>lemurs,</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> giant mouse <b>lemurs,</b> fork-marked <b>lemurs,</b> <b>and</b> hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur.</b> [...] The mouse lemur genus Microcebus includes the smallest primates in the world. [...] Phylogenetic analyses of D-loop DNA sequences of various lemur species suggest that the gray mouse lemur may be most closely related to the reddish-gray mouse lemur (M.griseorufus).|$|R
50|$|The fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus medius), {{also known}} as the lesser <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> western fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> or spiny forest <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> is endemic to Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|The greater <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus major), or the Geoffroy's <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> is a lemur that {{is widely}} {{distributed}} over {{the primary and}} secondary forests near the eastern coast of Madagascar. They are also found in northern parts of Madagascar. Greater <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> live in forests and dry scrub areas. The head and body of the greater <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> can range from 167 to 264 millimeters in length, and 164 to 600 grams. Their tails can range from 195 to 310 millimeters in length.|$|R
500|$|Like other cheirogaleids, {{the dental}} formula for giant mouse lemurs is {{on each side}} of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36teeth. Their upper teeth {{converge}} towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in mouse lemurs. The first upper premolar (P2) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P3). Unlike mouse <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> more like <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> giant mouse lemurs have a prominent anterior lower premolar (P2). Also more aligned with <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs,</b> the first two upper molars (M1–2) have a more anterior hypocone that sits opposite the metacone, compared to the mouse lemurs' more posterior hypocone, which is presumably a symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait. Also on M1 and M2, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small cuspules. In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both <b>dwarf</b> <b>and</b> mouse <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Montagne d'Ambre <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> or Andy Sabin's <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus andysabini) is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> known only from Amber Mountain National Park and the {{surrounding}} area in northern Madagascar. It was identified in 2005, but not formally described until 2015. Its conservation status has not been determined, but it is at risk from deforestation and possibly hunting from nearby human populations.|$|R
5|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri Filhol was {{the first}} to scientifically describe a species of Pachylemur; he named <b>Lemur</b> insignis <b>and</b> <b>Lemur</b> intermedius in 1895 {{on the basis of a}} few subfossil bones. Descriptions of other species now placed in Pachylemur quickly followed. In 1899, Guillaume Grandidier named a new genus and species, Palaeochirogalus jullyi, on the basis of two teeth from Antsirabe, central Madagascar, which he thought similar to <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Cheirogaleus). In 1903, Grafton Elliot Smith placed this species in the genus Lemur (as <b>Lemur</b> jullyi), <b>and</b> in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a synonym of Lemur insignis.|$|R
500|$|Early {{distribution}} of lemur species among genera differed {{in a number}} of ways from current taxonomy. For example, the fork-marked lemurs were initially placed in <b>Lemur</b> <b>and</b> then in Microcebus with the mouse lemurs before being placed in their own genus Phaner, and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major split the Cheirogaleus medius species group of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> into a separate genus Opolemur, but this was not accepted. Genus-level taxonomy was largely stabilized by Schwarz in 1931, but a number of later changes have become accepted: ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{two decades}} prior to 2013, only two <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> species were known, but in 2000 {{primatologist}} Colin Groves raised the number to seven based on morphological data acquired from museum samples. However, in 2009 and 2011, two of these new species were rejected. The Lavasoa <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> named for the Lavasoa Mountains in southern Madagascar, became the sixth known species in 2013 when it was differentiated from the furry-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (C. crossleyi) through analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear material performed {{by a team of}} German and Malagasy researchers. Furthermore, their research suggested the existence of three more new <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> species that they provisionally named Cheirogaleus sp. Ranomafana Andrambovato, Cheirogaleus sp. Bekaraoka Sambava, and Cheirogaleus sp. Ambanja, based on the regions the samples were collected. The Lavasoa <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> is most closely related to C. sp. Ranomafana/Andrambovato. The authors speculated that even greater species diversity may be found among <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> by future studies due to their large geographic range and the great genetic distance exhibited within the genus.|$|R
500|$|The hairy-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> {{was first}} {{placed in the}} genus Cheirogaleus (<b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs)</b> [...] in 1875 and was later found to have closer affinities with Microcebus. [...] However, its {{dentition}} and cranium structure were held sufficiently distinct to merit elevation to its own genus, Allocebus.|$|R
50|$|The Ankarana <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> or Sheth's <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus shethi) is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> part of the C. medius group, known only from {{northern}} Madagascar. It {{has been found in}} two reserves (Ankarana Special Reserve and Analamerana Special Reserve) as well as two protected areas (Andrafiamena-Andavakoera and Loky-Manambato). It was identified in 2014, but not formally described until 2016. Its conservation status has not been determined, but it is at risk from habitat destruction due to daily resource extraction by local human populations.|$|R
2500|$|Family Cheirogaleidae: (32 species), <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Madagascar) ...|$|R
5|$|Lemurs {{have either}} {{presently}} or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With {{the diversity of}} adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among <b>lemur</b> families <b>and</b> some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, {{three of the five}} species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, <b>and</b> giant mouse <b>lemurs</b> sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse <b>lemur</b> <b>and</b> the fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus medius), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> ruffed <b>lemurs</b> are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, <b>and</b> bamboo <b>lemurs</b> specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo <b>lemur,</b> <b>and</b> the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.|$|R
50|$|The furry-eared <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus crossleyi), or Crossley's <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur,</b> {{only found}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar, as with all other lemurs. It has a pelage {{coloration}} that is red-brown dorsally and gray ventrally. The eye-rings of this species are blackish and the ears are black inside and out.|$|R
5|$|<b>Dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|R
5000|$|Between 2000 and 2009, a {{population}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> {{was known as a}} separate species, the southern fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus adipicaudatus). It was described by taxonomist Colin Groves as having a pelage coloration that is dark dorsally and gray ventrally, with a vaguely expressed dorsal stripe running down the back, a relatively short white median facial stripe, and black eye-rings. [...] However, in 2009, Groeneveld et al. demonstrated genetically that Cheirogaleus adipicaudatus was a synonym of Cheirogaleus medius, so the southern fat-tailed <b>dwarf</b> <b>Lemur</b> is no longer recognized as a species.|$|R
