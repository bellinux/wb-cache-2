40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{automotive}} industry {{has been forced to}} reduce the harmful and pollutant emissions emitted by direct injected diesel engines. To accomplish this difficult task various solutions have been proposed. One of these proposed solutions is the usage of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> in addition to the use of liquid diesel. These <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> have more gasoline-like properties, such as high octane numbers, and are thereby are resistant against auto-ignition. Diesel on the other hand, has a high cetane number which makes it prone to auto-ignition. In this case the <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> is injected in the inlet manifold, and the diesel is direct injected in the cylinder {{at the end of the}} compression stroke. Thereby the diesel fuel spontaneously ignites and acts as an ignition source. The main goals for the use of a dual-fuel operation with diesel and <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> are the reduction of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission. Furthermore, the application of such a dual-fuel operation can offer potential economic and efficiency advantages. Depending on the <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> used these goals can be achieved. In general, dual-fuel combustion of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> and diesel decreases soot emissions compared with normal diesel combustion except for syngas. Furthermore, increasing load and/or <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> content leads to a further decrease in soot emissions. Both the application natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> offer the possibility to diminish nitrogen oxide emissions probably due to homogenous mixture compositions and/or decreased mixture temperatures. However, the using hydrogen or syngas in dual-fuel combustion tends to increase nitrogen oxide emissions; this might be due to the higher flame temperatures and combustion rates of these gasses. Furthermore, the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxides tend to increase for all evaluated <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> with dual fuel combustion mainly due to incomplete combustion of mixture trapped in crevices. Efficiencies of the different <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> are in the same order of magnitude. Some seem to lead to slight efficiency improvements (hydrogen and LPG) while others result in a slight decrease (natural gas and syngas). However, the significant price difference of natural gas and LPG compared to diesel can offer a considerable economic advantage...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} design and {{construction}} of a Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) micro combustion system. The design of the combustor requires {{a detailed analysis of}} the flame’s operational properties and stability. To this end, an analytic model was created to address these concerns. These results were used in conjunction with a detailed numerical analysis to determine the stable operating range of the combustors. The combustion of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> requires a <b>device</b> with a lower bound on the channel feature size. This lower limit for combustion corresponds to the minimum quenching distance of the specific fuel being used and usually corresponds to the upper end of silicon MEMs processing techniques and the lower end of meso-scale production processes. This millimeter size range represents the normal feature size range for the LTCC tape system. A potential material imposed restriction to using LTCC is the relatively low temperature operating range when compared to the adiabatic flame temperatures encountered in the combustion of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels.</b> To address this concern an analytic model of the heat transfer from a simple straight channel device is presented. This model allows for the analysis of the thermal loads in the substrate as well as provides insight into the effects of the channel geometry on the stability of the flame. Several experimental devices were designed and tested in accordance with the predictions of the analytic model. These devices have similar geometric configurations with different characteristic lengths to explore the feasible operating regimes of the LTCC micro combustor. This allows for the validation of the flame stability margins and heat transfer properties predicted by the analytic model. Infrared imaging allows for the mapping of the device surface temperature and provides a correlation mechanism to the analytic model. The results of the experimental testing show the same trending characteristics predicted by the analytic analysis. However, a detailed numerical analysis is needed to fully capture the quantitive power production capabilities of the device...|$|R

40|$|Petroleum {{resources}} are finite and, therefore, search for their alternative non-petroleum fuels for internal combustion engines is continuing {{all over the}} world. Moreover gases emitted by petroleum fuel driven vehicles have an adverse {{effect on the environment}} and human health. There is universal acceptance of the need to reduce such emissions. Towards this, scientists have proposed various solutions for diesel engines, one of which is the use of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> as a supplement for liquid diesel fuel. These engines, which use conventional diesel <b>fuel</b> and <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel,</b> are referred to as 'dual-fuel engines'. Natural gas and bio-derived gas appear more attractive alternative fuels for dual-fuel engines in view of their friendly environmental nature. In the gas-fumigated dual-fuel engine, the primary fuel is mixed outside the cylinder before it is inducted into the cylinder. A pilot quantity of liquid fuel is injected {{towards the end of the}} compression stroke to initiate combustion. When considering a <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> for use in existing diesel engines, a number of issues which include, the effects of engine operating and design parameters, and type of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel,</b> on the performance of the dual-fuel engines, are important. This paper reviews the research on above issues carried out by various scientists in different diesel engines. This paper touches upon performance, combustion and emission characteristics of dual-fuel engines which use natural gas, biogas, producer gas, methane, liquefied petroleum gas, propane, etc. as <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel.</b> It reveals that 'dual-fuel concept' is a promising technique for controlling both NOx and soot emissions even on existing diesel engine. But, HC, CO emissions and 'bsfc' are higher for part load gas diesel engine operations. Thermal efficiency of dual-fuel engines improve either with increased engine speed, or with advanced injection timings, or with increased amount of pilot fuel. The ignition characteristics of the <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> need more research for a long-term use in a dual-fuel engine. It is found that, the selection of engine operating and design parameters play a vital role in minimizing the performance divergences between an existing diesel engine and a 'gas diesel engine'.

40|$|Bi-fuel spark {{ignition}} engines, nowadays widely spread, are usually equipped with two independent injection systems, in order run the engine either with gasoline or with <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel,</b> {{which can be}} Natural Gas (NG) or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). These gases, besides lower cost and environmental impact, are also characterized by a higher knock resistance with respect to gasoline that allows to adopt a stoichiometric proportion with air also at full load. Gasoline, on the other hand, being injected as liquid, maintains higher volumetric efficiency and hence higher power output. As a compromise solution, it could be desired to exploit the advantages of both gasoline and gas (NG or LPG), thus performing a Double- Fuel injection: as already experimented by the authors [1, 2], the addition of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> to the gasoline/air mixture increases knocking resistance, allowing to run the engine with both “overall stoichiometric” mixture (thus lowering fuel consumption and emissions) and better spark advance (which increases engine efficiency) even at full load: the results showed high improvements in engine efficiency without noticeable power losses respect to the pure gasoline operation. Since no references {{have been found in}} literature on the Octane Number of both NG-gasoline and LPGgasoline blends, the authors decided to experimentally determine the knock resistance increase due to <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> addition to normal air-gasoline mixtures. A wide experimental campaign has been carried out in order to evaluate the correlation between the gaseous fuel-gasoline mixture composition and its overall knock resistance measured in terms of Motor Octane Number (MON).
