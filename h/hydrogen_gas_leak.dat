In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>leaking</b> into external air may spontaneously ignite.

Although the original purpose of the system was to detect leaks in the main engine {{of the space shuttle}} while on the launch pad, it also has significant commercial potential in applications for which there are no existing commercial systems. With high sensitivity, the system can detect hydrogen leaks at low concentrations in inert environments. The sensors are integrated with hardware and software to form a complete system. Several of these systems have already been purchased for use on the Ford Motor Company assembly line for natural gas vehicles. This system to detect trace hydrogen gas leaks from pressurized systems consists of a microprocessor-based control unit that operates a network of sensors. The sensors can be deployed around pipes, connectors, flanges, and tanks of pressurized systems where leaks may occur. The control unit monitors the sensors and provides the operator with a visual representation of the magnitude and locations of the leak as a function of time. The system can be customized to fit the user's needs; for example, it can monitor and display the condition of the flanges and fittings associated with the tank of a natural gas vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Optical fiber based sensors offer several {{important}} advantages over electronic sensors, including low manufacturing cost, miniature and flexible structures, immunities to electromagnetic fields, and {{the capability of}} distributive and multi-parameter sensing on a single fiber. Extreme harsh environments such as temperature > 800 °C or as low as a few Kelvin, present unique challenges and opportunities to fiber optic sensors. For example, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detection in cryogenic environment is critically important in the production and use of liquid hydrogen fuels. But the sensitivity of conventional Palladium (Pd) coated hydrogen sensors degrade rapidly when temperature decreases. Another example is the quick diminishing of conventional type-I gratings with temperature range beyond 500 °C, which prevent the FBG implementation in numerous high temperature applications. The objective of this thesis is to explore new fiber sensing technologies that have significant performance enhancements, or were previously not possible in extreme environment applications. Optically heated fiber sensors were developed for cryogenic Hydrogen gas and liquid level sensing in environments as well as room temperature gas flow sensing. Regenerated gratings were developed for high temperature pressure sensing. Novel in-fiber sensing techniques such as Rayleigh and Raman scattering were also exploited for fully distributed sensing operations. These technologies and devices offer reliable and flexible sensing solutions extreme environments in energy, transportation and telecom industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Low-cost, hydrogen-gas-leak {{detectors}} {{are needed}} for many hydrogen applications, such as hydrogen-fueled vehicles where several detectors may be required in different locations on each vehicle. A fiber-optic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detector could be inherently safer than conventional detectors, because it would remove all detector electronics from the vicinity of potential leaks. It would also provide freedom from electromagnetic interference, a serious problem in fuel-cell-powered electric vehicles. This paper describes progress {{in the design of}} a fiber-optic, surface-plasmon-resonance hydrogen detector, and efforts to make it more sensitive, selective, and durable. Chemochromic materials, such as tungsten oxide and certain Lanthanide hydrides, can reversibly react with hydrogen in air while exhibiting significant changes in their optical properties. Thin films of these materials applied to a sensor {{at the end of an}} optical fiber have been used to detect low concentrations of hydrogen gas in air. The coatings include a thin silver layer in which the surface plasmon is generated, a thin film of the chemochromic material, and a catalytic layer of palladium that facilitates the reaction with hydrogen. The film thickness is chosen to produce a guided-surface plasmon wave along the interface between the silver and the chemochromic material. A dichroic be m-splitter separates the reflected spectrum into a portion near the resonance and a portion away from the resonance, and directs these two portions to two separate photodiodes. The electronic ratio of these two signals cancels most of the fiber transmission noise and provides a stable hydrogen signal...|$|E

50|$|The Hydrogen Hybrid system {{offers the}} same level of safety as {{existing}} petrol powered engines. Alset Global emphasises that the hydrogen tank designed provides {{the same level}} of safety as a petrol-powered vehicle and that the danger level is no more than that. Indeed, ultra high-strength fibre tanks ensure the safety of the hydrogen fuel. Alset Global has proven the complete safety of its system through the safety requirements met at Nürburgring's 24-hour Race. This race is considered as one of the toughest technical challenges race cars can face in the world. In addition, hydrogen is known to be as much as four times more diffusive than natural gas. This means that if <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> is <b>leaking,</b> it will quickly go up in the atmosphere. Furthermore, when hydrogen burns, its radiant heat is just one-tenth that of a hydrocarbon fire. Finally, hydrogen burns 7% cooler than gasoline.|$|R
25|$|There {{have also}} been some {{concerns}} over possible problems related to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> leakage. Molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>leaks</b> slowly from most containment vessels. It has been hypothesized that if significant amounts of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> (H2) escape, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> may, because of ultraviolet radiation, form free radicals (H) in the stratosphere. These free radicals would {{then be able to}} act as catalysts for ozone depletion. A large enough increase in stratospheric hydrogen from leaked H2 could exacerbate the depletion process. However, the effect of these leakage problems may not be significant. The amount of hydrogen that leaks today is much lower (by a factor of 10–100) than the estimated 10–20% figure conjectured by some researchers; for example, in Germany, the leakage rate is only 0.1% (less than the natural <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> rate of 0.7%). At most, such leakage would likely be no more than 1–2% even with widespread hydrogen use, using present technology.|$|R
40|$|Following the Challenger tragedy, an {{evaluation}} of the integrated main propulsion system flight data revealed a premature decay in the hydrogen external tank ullage pressure. A reconstruction of predicted ullage pressure versus time indicated an inconsistency between predicted and measured ullage pressure starting at approximately 65. 5 seconds into the flight and reaching a maximum value between 72 and 72. 9 seconds. This discrepancy could have been caused by a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> or by a liquied hydrogen leak that occurred either in the pressurization system or in the external tank. The corresponding leak rates over the time interval from 65. 5 to 72. 9 seconds were estimated to range from 0. 28 kg/s (0. 62 lbm/s) + or - 41 percent to between 0. 43 and 0. 51 kg/s (0. 94 and 1. 12 lbs/s) + or - 1 percent for a gas leak and from 72. 9 kg/s (160. 5 lbs/s) + or - 41 percent to between 111. 6 and 133. 2 kg/s (245. 8 and 293. 3 lbs/s) + or - 1 percent for a liquid leak. No speculation is made to ascertain whether the leak is liquid or gas, as this cannot be determined from the analysis performed. Four structural failures in the hydrogen external tank were considered to explain the leak rates. A break in the 5 -cm (2 in) pressurization line, in the 13 -cm (5 in) vent line, or in the 43 -cm (17 in) feedline is not likely. A break in the 10 -cm (4 in) recirculation line with a larger structural failure occurring in the 72 to 73 -second time period, the time of the visibly identified premature pressure decay, does seem plausible and the most likely of the four modes considered. These modes are not all-inclusive and do not preclude the possibility of a leak elsewhere in the tank...|$|E
40|$|During the Space Shuttle Program, one of {{the most}} {{hazardous}} operation that occurred was the loading of liquid hydrogen (LH 2) during fueling operations of the spacecraft. Due to hydrogen's low explosive limit, any amount leaked could lead to catastrophic event. Hydrogen's chemical properties make it ideal as a rocket fuel; however, the fuel is deemed unsafe for most commercial use because of the inability to easily detect the gas leaking. The increased use of hydrogen over traditional fossil fuels would reduce greenhouse gases and America's dependency on foreign oil. Therefore a technology that would improve safety at NASA and in the commercial sector while creating a new economic sector would have a huge impact to NASA's mission. The Chemochromic Detector for sensing hydrogen gas leakage is a color-changing detector that is useful in any application where {{it is important to know}} not only the presence but also the location of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>leak.</b> This technology utilizes a chemochromicpigment and polymer matrix that can be molded or spun into rigid or pliable shapes useable in variable temperature environments including atmospheres of inert gas, hydrogen gas, or mixtures of gases. A change in color of the detector material indicates where gaseous hydrogen leaks are occurring. The irreversible sensor has a dramatic color change from beige to dark grey and remains dark grey after exposure. A reversible pigment changes from white to blue in the presence of hydrogen and reverts back to white in the presence of oxygen. Both versions of the sensor's pigments were comprised of a mixture of a metal oxide substrate and a hydro-chromic compound (i. e., the compound that changed color in the presence of hydrogen) and immediately notified the operator of the presence of low levels of hydrogen. The detector can be used in a variety of formats including paint, tape, caulking, injection molded parts, textiles and fabrics, composites, and films. This technology brings numerous benefits over the traditional hydrogen sensors: The technology has excellent temperature stability (4 K to 373 K), it can be used in cryogenic fluid applications, it is easy to apply and remove; it requires no power to operate; it has a quick response time; the leak points can be detected visually or electronically; it is nonhazardous, thus environmentally friendly; it can be reversible or irreversible; it does not require on-site monitoring; has a long shelf life; the detector is very durable; and the technology is inexpensive to manufacture...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} pertinent design {{practices of}} selecting types of monitors, monitor unit placement, setpoint selection, and maintenance considerations for <b>gas</b> monitors. While <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> monitors and enriched oxygen atmosphere monitors {{as they would}} be needed for hydrogen production experiments are {{the primary focus of}} this paper, monitors for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are also discussed. The experiences of designing, installing, and calibrating gas monitors for a laboratory where experiments in support of the DOE Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) are described along with codes, standards, and regulations for these monitors. Information from the literature about best operating practices is also presented. The NHI program has two types of activities. The first, near-term activity is laboratory and pilot-plant experimentation with different processes in the kilogram per day scale to select the most promising types of processes for future applications of hydrogen production. Prudent design calls for indoor gas monitors to sense any hydrogen leaks within these laboratory rooms. The second, longer-term activity is the prototype, or large-scale plants to produce tons of hydrogen per day. These large, outdoor production plants will require area (or “fencepost”) monitoring of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>leaks.</b> Some processes will have oxygen production with hydrogen production, and any oxygen releases are also safety concerns since oxygen gas is the strongest oxidizer. Monitoring of these gases is important for personnel safety of both indoor and outdoor experiments. There is some guidance available about proper placement of monitors. The fixed point, stationary monitor can only function if the intruding gas contacts the monitor. Therefore, monitor placement is vital to proper monitoring of the room or area. Factors in sensor location selection include: indoor or outdoor site, the location and nature of potential vapor/gas sources, chemical and physical data of the gases or vapors, liquids with volatility need sensors near the potential sources of release, nature and concentration of gas releases, natural and mechanical ventilation, detector installation locations not vulnerable to mechanical or water damage from normal operations, and locations that lend themselves to convenient maintenance and calibration. The guidance also states that sensors should be located in all areas where hazardous accumulations of gas may occur. Such areas might not be close to release points but might be areas with restricted air movement. Heavier than air gases are likely to accumulate in pits, trenches, drains, and other low areas. Lighter than air gases are more likely to accumulate in overhead spaces, above drop ceilings, etc. In general, sensors should be located close to any potential sources of major release of gas. The paper gives data on monitor sensitivity and expected lifetimes to support the monitor selection process. Proper selection of indoor and outdoor locations for monitors is described, accounting for the vapor densities of hydrogen and oxygen. The latest information on monitor alarm setpoint selection is presented. Typically, monitors require recalibration at least every six months, or more frequently for inhospitable locations, so ready access to the monitors is an important issue to consider in monitor siting. Gas monitors, depending on their type, can be susceptible to blockages of the detector element (i. e., du...|$|R

In this thesis, we demonstrate an agile multi-functional active fiber optical hydrogen sensor for all temperature operations. Fiber-optical hydrogen sensors offer a number of advantages over other hydrogen sensor including explosive proof, low-cost, multiplexing, and capability of working in hostile environments. They are very suitable for mission-critical applications such as for hydrogen sensing and leak detection in aerospace vehicles. In this thesis, we demonstrate a multi-point, one-feed through, in-fiber hydrogen sensor capable of hydrogen detection below 0. 5 % concentration with a response time of less than 10 seconds. Our solution entails use of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) coated {{with a layer of}} hydrogen-absorbing palladium which, in turn, induces strain in the FBG in the presence of hydrogen. The hydrogen-induced stress was detected by the shift of FBG wavelength. The responsivity of fiber optic hydrogen sensor was calibrated for hydrogen concentration from 0. 1 % to 10 % and temperature range from - 120 oC to 120 oC. The optimal sensitivity and response time of the sensor was found to be highly sensitivity to the temperature. The response due to the presence of hydrogen is imperceptible until the temperature reaches about - 20 oC. To develop a fiber-based hydrogen sensor for operation at all temperature, infrared power laser light carried by the same fiber containing FBG was used to induce localized heating in the palladium coating which dramatically decreases sensor response time and increases the sensor's sensitivity at low temperatures. At - 50 oC localized heating yields 57 % of sensitivity of that at room temperature. This technology promises an inexpensive fiber solution for a multi-point hydrogen detection array with only one fiber feed-through operation for all-temperature hydrogen sensing...|$|R
