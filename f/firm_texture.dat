5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E

For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> required for Amigurumi crochet.|$|E
25|$|Panela {{is another}} white fresh milk cheese with little fat or cholesterol. The origins of this cheese {{probably}} {{goes back to}} the Balkans or the Italian peninsula, but it has been significantly modified to Mexican tastes. It is made with skim milk, giving it a fairly <b>firm</b> <b>texture,</b> with a sweet/sour taste. In traditional markets, this cheese is often sold in baskets in which it has been molded, giving it the alternate name of queso de canasta. It is often served cold as part of an appetizer or snack tray. It is also found on sandwiches in most parts of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|It {{originated}} in today's Indonesia, and is especially popular {{on the island}} of Java, where it is a staple source of protein. Like tofu, tempeh is made from soybeans, but it is a whole soybean product with different nutritional characteristics and textural qualities. Tempeh's fermentation process and its retention of the whole bean give it a higher content of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins. It has a <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> and an earthy flavor, which becomes more pronounced as it ages. Because of its nutritional value, tempeh is used worldwide in vegetarian cuisine, where it is used as a meat analogue.|$|E

500|$|The {{hedgehog}} mushroom {{is considered}} to be a good edible, having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy texture. Some consider it the culinary equivalent of the chanterelle. Author Michael Kuo gives it an edibility rating of [...] "great" [...] and notes that there are no poisonous lookalikes, and that they are unlikely to be infested with maggots. Delicately brushing the cap and stipe of specimens immediately after harvest will help prevent soil from getting lodged between the teeth. Hydnum repandum mushrooms can be cooked by pickling, simmering in milk or stock, and sautéeing, which creates a [...] "tender, meaty texture and a mild flavor." [...] The mushroom tissue absorbs liquids well and assumes the flavors of added ingredients. The <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> of the cooked mushroom makes it suitable for freezing. Its natural flavor is reportedly similar to the peppery taste of watercress, or oysters. Older specimens may have a bitter taste, but boiling can remove the bitterness. Specimens found under conifers can taste [...] "unpleasantly strong". The form amarum, locally common in Slovakia, is reportedly inedible because its fruit body has a bitter taste at all developmental stages.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Engleromyces sinensis form two roughly spherical lobes that {{partially}} envelop the bamboo substrate. The official description gives dimensions of [...] by [...] and [...] in height, although specimens in markets measuring [...] in diameter have been noted. When young, {{the surface is}} buff-colored with a pinkish hue and slightly dimpled surface; the color changes to grayish-brown and the surface becomes smoother as the fungus matures. The internal flesh is buff colored, with a <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> that later becomes woody. The ostioles (minute openings through which spores are released), which are scattered about {{the surface of the}} fruit bodies, are somewhat nipple-like when young but later become sharper (punctate). Situated under a crust with a thickness of about 1mm, the perithecia are arranged in rows. They are spherical to flask shaped, with eight-spored asci. The asci are funnel or T-shaped, somewhat like a golf tee, and measure about 4 by 4µm. They have an apical apparatus (a region at the ascus tip that forms the spore-shooting mechanism) that stains blue in Melzer's reagent. The smooth, black ascospores are lined up in a single row, and feature drop-like appendages that are visible when still in the ascus. Measuring 15–19 by 11.5–12.5µm, they are broadly [...] with one or both ends shortened, and lack a germ pore.|$|E

60|$|No one {{certainly}} ever {{enjoyed the}} pleasures of composition more intensely than I. If I left the woods, the solemn music of the waving branches, and the majestic temple of nature, I sought the vast halls of the Castle, and looked over wide, fertile England, spread beneath our regal mount, and listened the while to inspiring strains of music. At such times solemn harmonies or spirit-stirring airs gave wings to my lagging thoughts, permitting them, methought, to penetrate the last veil of nature and her God, and to display the highest beauty in visible expression to the understandings of men. As the music went on, my ideas seemed to quit their mortal dwelling house; they shook their pinions and began a flight, sailing on the placid current of thought, filling the creation with new glory, and rousing sublime imagery that else had slept voiceless. Then I would hasten to my desk, weave the new-found web of mind in <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> and brilliant colours, leaving the fashioning of the material to a calmer moment.|$|E

[...] The Method of Concomitant Variations is here, for the third time, had recourse to; and, as before, from necessity, since the texture of no substance is absolutely firm or absolutely loose. Looseness of texture, therefore, or something which {{is the cause of}} that quality, is another circumstance which promotes the deposition of dew; but this third course resolves itself into the first, viz., the quality of resisting the passage of heat: for substances of loose texture [...] "are precisely those which are best adapted for clothing, or for impeding the free passage of heat from the skin into the air, so as to allow their outer surfaces to be very cold, while they remain warm within;” and this last is, therefore, an induction (from fresh instances) simply corroborative of a former induction.|$|E

The {{first and}} grandest style {{resulted}} merely from {{the application of}} the pointed arch to the frequent Romanesque window, the large semicircular arch divided by three small ones. Pointing both the superior and inferior arches, and adding to the grace of the larger one by striking another arch above it with a more removed center, and placing the voussoirs at an acute angle to the curve, we have the truly noble form of domestic Gothic, which--more or less enriched by moldings and adorned by penetration, more or less open of the space between the including and inferior arches--was immediately adopted in almost all the proudest palaces of North Italy--in the Brolettos of Como, Bergamo, Modena, and Siena---in the palace of the Scaligers at Verona--of the Gambacorti at Pisa--of Paolo Guinigi at Lucca--besides inferior buildings innumerable:--nor is there any form of civil Gothic except the Venetian, which can be for a moment compared with it in simplicity or power. The latest is that most vicious and barbarous style of which the richest types are the lateral porches and upper pinnacles of the Cathedral of Como, and the whole of the Certosa of Pavia:--characterized by the imitative sculpture of large buildings on a small scale by way of pinnacles and niches; the substitution of candelabra for columns; and the covering of the surfaces with sculpture, often of classical subject, in high relief and daring perspective, and finished with delicacy which rather would demand preservation in a cabinet, and exhibition under a lens, than admit of exposure to the weather and removal from the eye, and which, therefore, architecturally considered, is worse than valueless, telling merely as unseemly roughness and rustication. But between these two extremes are varieties nearly countless--some of them both strange and bold, owing to the brilliant color and <b>firm</b> <b>texture</b> of the accessible materials, and the desire of the builders to crowd the greatest expression of value into the smallest space.|$|E
