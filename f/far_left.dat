5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E

5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest. For his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine, Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> near Neuenbürg.|$|E
5|$|Bryennios {{arranged}} {{his army}} in the typical three divisions, each in two lines, as prescribed by the Byzantine military manuals. The right wing, under his brother John, was 5,000 strong and comprised his Frankish mercenaries, Thessalian cavalry, the Hetaireia, and the Maniakatai regiment (descendants of the veterans of George Maniakes's campaign in Sicily and Italy). His left wing, 3,000 men from Thrace and Macedonia, was placed under Katakalon Tarchaneiotes, and the centre, under Bryennios himself, comprised 3,000–4,000 men from Thessaly, Thrace and Macedonia. Again, according to standard doctrine, on his <b>far</b> <b>left,</b> about half a kilometer ("two stadia") from the main force, he had stationed an outflanking detachment (hyperkerastai) of Pechenegs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E

50|$|The group exerted an {{important}} {{influence over the}} working class of Athens, and Speras and Fanourakis participated {{in the administration of}} the Labour Centre of Athens (EKA) for a considerable period of time. They collaborated with other groups and organisations which had been formed {{in the wake of the}} <b>far</b> <b>left’s</b> expulsion from SEKE, such as the group Kommounismos (Communism) and the Anexartiti Kommounistiki Neolaia (Independent Communist Youth), both followers of the tenets of Bolshevism.|$|R
5|$|The Imperial line formed up on {{a similar}} ridge facing the French position. On the <b>far</b> <b>left,</b> facing Des Thermes, were 300 Florentine light cavalry under Rodolfo Baglioni; {{flanking}} them to the right were 6,000 Italian infantry under Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno. In the center were the 7,000 landsknechte {{under the command of}} Eriprando Madruzzo. To their right was d'Avalos himself, together with the small force of about 200 heavy cavalry under Carlo Gonzaga. The Imperial right wing was composed of around 5,000 German and Spanish infantry under Ramón de Cardona; they were flanked, on the far right, by 300 Italian light cavalry under Philip de Lannoy, Prince of Sulmona.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, {{the twelve}} Apostles and an {{assortment}} of dignitaries are positioned at either side of Michael in a Deësis. The apostles are seated in a semicircle; Peter, dressed in red, is on the <b>far</b> <b>left,</b> and Paul, dressed in green, is on the far right. The seven haloed dignitaries, dressed in contemporary clothing, are unidentified but include a king, a pope, a bishop, a monk, and three women. Rather than general representative types, they are portraits of specific unidentified individuals, according to Shirley Blum.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has a campus-wide television station, GUTV, which began broadcasting in 1999. The station hosts an annual student film festival in April for campus filmmakers. WGTB, Georgetown's radio station, is {{available as a}} webcast and on 92.3 FM in certain dormitories. The station was founded in 1946, and broadcast on 90.1 FM from 1960 to 1979, when university president Timothy S. Healy gave away the frequency and broadcast capabilities to the University of the District of Columbia because of WGTB's <b>far</b> <b>left</b> political orientation. The station now broadcasts through the Internet in its headquarters in the Leavey Center.|$|E

5|$|To {{prepare for}} the move to Triple-A, renovations {{continued}} prior to the 1985 season {{with the addition of}} 1,200box seats, which replaced some of the reserved grandstand seating, as well as more seating past the right field foul pole. A 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3.0m) high replaced the stadium's original, which was relocated to <b>far</b> <b>left</b> field to serve as an out-of-town scoreboard, providing scores for American League, National League, and American Association baseball games.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the War of the Second Coalition in 1799, when the armies of the Danube and Helvetia were formed, he was {{assigned}} to the Army of the Danube under command of Jean Baptiste Jourdan. His 10th Regiment was part of Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr's III. Division, and held the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> flank at the Battle of Ostrach, 21 March 1799, in southwestern Germany. Although he was wounded on 14 August 1799 in Switzerland, he participated in the Second Battle of Zurich in which his 10th Chasseurs à Cheval routed a division of Russians, a decisive moment in the French victory. Ordener was promoted to colonel of the regiment in 1801 and on 29 August 1803, he was promoted to general of brigade.|$|E
5|$|Christensen {{was born}} as Else Oscher in 1913 in Esbjerg, western Denmark. She became a {{professional}} handweaver and in 1933 moved to Copenhagen. There, she embraced anarcho-syndicalism {{and became a}} follower of the anarcho-syndicalist ideologue Christian Christensen. Exposed to the various competing radical groups on both the far right and <b>far</b> <b>left,</b> she came under the increasing influence of the Strasserite wing within the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark (DNSAP), a group which had embraced the Nazi ideology of Germany's Nazi Party. In 1937 she married the woodcarver and unionist Aage Alex Christensen, who had served as the top lieutenant of the DNSAP leader Cay Lembcke. The Christensens became associated with the Strasserite National Bolshevik faction of the party, but Aage {{was part of the}} faction ousted when Fritz Clausen seized control.|$|E

5|$|Coburg's Advance Guard under Archduke Charles {{was drawn}} {{up on the}} right flank, Graf Colloredo and the Duke of Württemberg {{stood in the center}} and the Count of Clerfayt with the Reserve defended the left flank. The village of Halle was at the far right of the line while Neerwinden village was in the left-center. A screen of Coalition light troops was posted in all the hamlets along the Little Gete. Dumouriez {{organized}} eight columns of attack. Valence on the right led three attack columns against Racour and Oberwinden, the Duke of Chartres directed two columns in the center via Laer and Miranda commanded three columns on the left along the main road to Halle. The French reserve formed a final column on the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> where it was to first capture Zoutleeuw (Leau) and then swing south against Halle. Lamarche's Advance Guard operated with the Right Wing.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began {{crossing}} the Drava, but {{construction of a}} bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki, the <b>far</b> <b>left</b> formation of the 4th Army. This crossing, combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line from Slovenska Bistrica to Ptuj, exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night of 10/11 April.|$|E

5|$|Six outer panels (or shutters) are hinged; when folded {{they show}} an {{exterior}} view of saints and the donors.

Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, that to his <b>far</b> <b>left</b> the entrance to Hell.

5|$|The <b>far</b> <b>left</b> wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, {{guarded the}} Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear to him that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of horse}} and foot {{soldiers}} {{immersed in a}} sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the <b>far</b> <b>left.</b> The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.|$|E
5000|$|Right {{wing and}} {{nationalist}} armed groups, like the Stahlhelm or the SA, {{as well as}} the left-wing Communist Red Front Fighters had continued to radicalize and intensify the political struggle in Germany. The Reichsbanner was initially formed in reaction to the far right's [...] "Beer Hall" [...] Putsch and <b>far</b> <b>left's</b> Hamburg rebellion, both failed coups, which had taken place at the end of 1923. On 22 February 1924 members of the SPD, the German Centre Party, the German Democratic Party and trade unionists in Magdeburg established the Reichsbanner. However the proportion of Social Democrats in the membership clearly outweighed all others, with estimates of up to 90 per cent.|$|R
