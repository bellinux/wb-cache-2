5|$|Every Christmas, Oxford Street is {{decorated}} with festive lights. The tradition of Christmas lights began in 1959, {{five years after the}} neighbouring Regent Street. There were no light displays in 1976 or 1977 due to economic recession, but the lights returned in 1978 when Oxford Street organised a laser display, and they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> every year since.|$|E
5|$|The vulcanoids, {{should they}} be found, may provide {{scientists}} with material from the first period of planet formation, as well as insights into the conditions prevalent in the early Solar System. Although every other gravitationally stable region in the Solar System {{has been found to}} contain objects, non-gravitational forces (such as the Yarkovsky effect) or the influence of a migrating planet {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's development may have depleted this area of any asteroids that may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, debtors in England were {{routinely}} imprisoned at {{the pleasure of}} their creditors. Around 10,000people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts. In the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors. According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ₤5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ₤16,442 (over ₤1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two debtors were found to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for 30years.|$|E

5|$|Feral {{horses are}} {{documented}} as {{living in the}} Pryor Mountains by the early 1700s, although they may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> since the late 1600s. By the late 1800s, thousands of feral horses inhabited the area. In the early 1900s, many of the unbranded horses were rounded up, to allow domesticated livestock to graze the range without competition, and by 1964 there were only around 200 horses left. In 1964, the BLM announced that the horses would be removed altogether, to the outrage of the public. The controversy continued until 1968, when the BLM was legally stopped from removing all of the horses, and the area declared a Wild Horse Refuge. After the 1971 signing of the WFRHBA, the BLM spent the 1980s and 1990s conducting population studies and developing management and adoption policies; during this time, numerous genetic studies were also completed.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, {{numbered}} 535 {{men on the}} eve of its {{attack against}} Hill 314, less its rear echelons. The US troops took the hill and fended off a counterattck. Many of the officers in the companies were wounded but refused evacuation and simply continued the attack. The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms, helmets, and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 North Korean dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> most of them had been wounded or were missing. After the capture of Hill 314 on September 12, the situation north of Taegu improved. On September 14 the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked and, supported by fire from Hill 314, gained part of Hill 570 from the NK 19th Regiment, 13th Division.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it might not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} held Hill 314 for {{the next}} six days and gathered up a large amount of North Korean equipment and ammunition. The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms, helmets, and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 North Korean dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> most of them had been wounded or were missing. Several war crimes committed by the North Koreans came to light during the action on Hill 314. On September 12 while the final action on the hill was taking place, troops discovered an American officer who had been bound, gasoline poured over him, and burned. Two days later members of the battalion found on the hill the bodies of four other American soldiers with their hands tied. The bodies bore evidence that the men had been bayoneted and shot while bound.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator. They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message. Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

5|$|In February 1931, de Hauteclocque {{went back}} to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he {{reported}} to Général de brigade Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a goum. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, Général de division Antoine Huré, felt that de Hauteclocque should not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to capitaine. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most {{had to wait until}} 1936. He was also made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{absence of}} {{evidence}} that it rained (i.e. water is the evidence) may be considered positive evidence {{that it did not}} rain.
