5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and <b>donepezil)</b> and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only <b>donepezil</b> is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
25|$|Aricept (<b>donepezil)</b> for Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} marketed in some {{countries}} as a combination drug with <b>donepezil</b> under the brands Namzaric, Neuroplus Dual, and Tonibral MD.|$|E
25|$|To combat this, <b>donepezil</b> {{has been}} tested in healthy elderly {{patients}} where it was shown to increase time spent in REM sleep and improve next day memory recall.|$|E
25|$|Rivastigmine, an {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitor, inhibits both butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase (unlike <b>donepezil,</b> which selectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase). It {{is thought}} to work by inhibiting these cholinesterase enzymes, which would otherwise break down the brain neurotransmitter acetylcholine.|$|E
25|$|Usage of {{rivastigmine}} {{was associated}} with a higher frequency of reports of death as an adverse event in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database compared to the other acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs <b>donepezil</b> and galantamine.|$|E
25|$|Its {{efficacy}} {{is similar}} to <b>donepezil</b> and tacrine. Doses below 6mg/d may be ineffective. The effects {{of this kind of}} drug in different kinds of dementia (including Alzheimer's dementia) are modest, and it is still unclear which AcCh(ButCh) esterase inhibitor is better in Parkinson's dementia, though rivastigmine is well-studied.|$|E
25|$|At present {{there is}} no cure. Treatments are {{supportive}} and attempt to relieve some of the motor and psychological symptoms associated with the disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as <b>donepezil,</b> may provide some benefit. Some motor problems may improve with levodopa. Antipsychotics, even for hallucinations, should generally be avoided due to side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{will depend}} on the cause of memory loss, but various drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease have been suggested in recent years. There are four drugs currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, and they all act on the cholinergic system: <b>Donepezil,</b> Galantamine, Rivastigmine, and Tacrine. Although these medications are not the cure for Alzheimer’s, symptoms may be reduced for up to eighteen months for mild or moderate dementia. These drugs do not forestall the ultimate decline to full Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceutical management, as with Parkinson's disease, {{involves}} {{striking a}} balance between treating the motor, emotive, and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms appear to respond somewhat to the medications used to treat Parkinson's disease (e.g. levodopa), while cognitive issues may improve with medications for Alzheimer's disease such as <b>donepezil.</b> Medications used {{in the treatment of}} ADHD (e.g. methylphenidate) might improve cognition or daytime sleepiness; however, medications for both Parkinson's disease and ADHD increase levels of the chemical dopamine in the brain, so increase the risk of hallucinations with those classes of pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|In healthy adults, longterm visual {{episodic memory}} can be {{enhanced}} specifically through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor <b>Donepezil,</b> whereas verbal episodic memory can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Tolcapone. Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, {{there are several other}} products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory. A recent placebo controlled study found that DHEA, which is a functional cortisol antagonist, improves episodic memory in healthy young men (Alhaj et al. 2006).|$|E
500|$|Glutamate is an {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter of {{the nervous}} system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Memantine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. Memantine {{has been shown to}} have a small benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. The combination of memantine and <b>donepezil</b> {{has been shown to be}} [...] "of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness".|$|E
2500|$|A {{preliminary}} study indicates taking <b>donepezil</b> (Aricept) {{may help prevent}} falls in people with Parkinson's. [...] <b>Donepezil</b> boosts the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and is currently an approved therapy for the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. [...] In the study, participants taking <b>donepezil</b> experienced falls half as often as those taking a placebo, and those who previously fell the most showed the most improvement.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and <b>donepezil</b> (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to <b>donepezil</b> than Alzheimer's disease. Memantine also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil, may improve daytime alertness, but as with the antiparkinsonian drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E

50|$|Most {{studies on}} <b>donepezil</b> {{are unable to}} {{conclusively}} verify the neuroenhancement capability of the drug. In such studies, it was seen participants that took <b>donepezil</b> scored higher than those that took the placebo. <b>Donepezil</b> helps individuals retain training tasks, verbal memory, and episodic memory. In sleep deprivation studies, while <b>donepezil</b> {{had no effect on}} well-rested patients, it had a positive effect on patients with 24 hours of sleep deprivation. Such patients benefited from increased memory performance and attention that would otherwise be deficit in such sleep-deprived conditions. However, this effect was only seen in individuals whose performance declined significantly due to sleep deprivation.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{drugs have}} been known to induce hypergraphia {{including}} <b>donepezil.</b> In one case study, a patient taking <b>donepezil</b> reported an elevation in mood and energy levels which led to hypergraphia and other excessive forms of speech (such as singing). Six other cases of patients taking <b>donepezil</b> and experiencing mania have been previously reported. These patients also had cases of dementia, cognitive impairment from a cerebral aneurysm, bipolar I disorder, and/or depression. Researchers are unsure why <b>donepezil</b> can induce mania and hypergraphia. It could potentially result from an increase in acetylcholine levels, which would {{have an effect on the}} other neurotransmitters in the brain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Donepezil</b> {{has also}} been studied in {{patients}} with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-Coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment reported <b>donepezil</b> was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, {{but this was not}} sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with <b>donepezil</b> throughout the study. At this time, though, <b>donepezil</b> is not indicated for prevention of dementia.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{evidence}} that <b>donepezil</b> or other similar agents alters the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. 6 to 12-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition and/or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends <b>donepezil</b> as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved <b>donepezil</b> for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
