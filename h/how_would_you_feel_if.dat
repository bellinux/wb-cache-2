40|$|I am {{driven by}} the goal of {{building}} a healthy world, where each man, woman and child {{has the opportunity to}} reach their full potential. A key part of this involves creating a world where poverty is neither acceptable nor necessary. On the surface, eradicating poverty looks hopeless because the extent of it is steadily increasing {{in the face of all}} our efforts. However, there is one essential issue that I believe, if resolved, would reverse poverty. It is our tolerance of alienation. It is our decision that it is all right for some people to feel alienated. I will argue that our willingness to tol-erate alienation is fundamental to the continuance of poverty—and it is this that we must deal with.

Although such practices may be hard for nontraders to understand, rehypothecation is widespread in financial markets.

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{memory for}} events during anesthesia show a confusing pattern {{of positive and}} negative results. To establish whether there are any consistent patterns of findings across studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of the data from 2517 patients in 44 studies. The meta-analysis included two measures of the effects of positive suggestions on postoperative recovery: (a) the duration of postoperative hospitalization and (b) the amount of morphine administered via patient-controlled anesthesia, as well as two measures of memory for specific information presented during anesthesia: (c) direct tests and (d) indirect tests. The meta-analysis indicated that positive suggestions presented during anesthesia have little or no effect on postoperative recovery. On the other hand, the metaanalysis showed that specific information is remembered following surgery, as long as testing is not delayed longer than 36 h.

40|$|Would {{you like}} a {{stranger}} more who shifts his/her attitudes to more closely align with yours? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> he/she aligned with everyone {{as opposed to just}} you? In Experiment 1, participants discussed with a partner disagreed upon social issues and received false feedback about whether the partner engaged in attitude alignment (shifted his/her attitude toward the participant’s attitude) following discussion. Participants also received false feedback about proportion of similarity (25 %, 50 %, or 75 %) to the partner. Participants reported greater attraction toward partners who engaged in attitude alignment and who were more similar. However, similarity only predicted attraction in the absence of attitude alignment. Additionally, partner attitude alignment led to participant attitude alignment, and perceived reasoning ability marginally mediated the attitude alignment-attraction relationship. Similar to Experiment 1, participants in Experiment 2 received attitude alignment feedback, but they also received feedback about whether the partner engaged in attitude alignment with no others besides the participant (selective) or with many others besides the participant (unselective). Participants reported greater attraction toward partners who engaged in attitude alignment with them regardless of the partners’ attitude alignment with others. Perceived reasoning ability again mediated the attitude alignment-attraction relationship, and appeared to be more important in explaining this relation than cognitive evaluation or inferred attraction. Finally, participants reported greater trust and respect for partners who engaged in attitude alignment, but were no more willing to help those partners. This work extends our understanding of attitude alignment and its potential to affect interpersonal relationships, and it considers the influence of judgments about individuals outside of the dyad (i. e., alignment with others relative to alignment with the self) ...|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{yourself}} queuing for the cashier’s desk in a supermarket. Naturally, {{you have}} picked the wrong line, {{the one that}} does not seem to move at all. Soon, you get tired of waiting. Now, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> the cashier suddenly started to sing? Many of us would be surprised and, regardless of the cashier’s singing abilities, feel amused. The preceding story {{is an example of how}} a surprise can transform something very normal, and maybe even boring, into a more pleasant experience. Analogously, a surprise in a product can overcome the habituation effect that is due to the fact that people encounter many similar products everyday. Colin Martindale describes this effect as ‘the gradual loss of interest in repeated stimuli’. ¹ A surprise reaction to a product can be beneficial to both a designer and a user. The designer benefits from a surprise reaction because it can capture attention to the product, leading to increased product recall and recognition, and increased word-ofmouth. ² Or, as Jennifer Hudson puts it, the surprise element “elevates a piece beyond the banal”. ³ A surprise reaction has its origin in encountering an unexpected event. The product user benefits from the surprise, because it makes the product more interesting to interact with. In addition, it requires updating, extending or revising the knowledge the expectation was based on. This implies that a user can learn somethingnew about a product or product aspect. Designers already use various strategies to design surprises in their products. Making use of contrast, mixing design styles or functions, using new materials or new shapes, and using humor are just a few of these. The lamp ‘Porca Miseria!’ designed by Ingo Maurer that is shown in the left part of Figure 1 consists of broken pieces of expensive porcelain tableware, making it a lamp with a unique shape. The idea that another product had to be destroyed to make this lamp may inflict feelings of 3 puzzlement and amusement on someone who sees this lamp. The perfume ‘Flowerbomb’ (right part of Figure 1) designed by fashion designers Victor & Rolf is another example. The bottle is shaped like a hand grenade and it holds a sweet smelling, soft pink liquid. By combining conflicting elements in their perfume bottle, Victor & Rolf have succeeded in creating a perfume that attracts attention amidst the dozens of perfumes that line the walls of perfumeries.

40|$|<b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> your {{biological}} materials – blood, skin cells, {{or the like}} – were used to develop sperm in a lab? What if it were conducted without your knowledge or consent? Most Americans likely are unaware that their {{biological materials}} have been stored and been made available for research. Federal regulations permit existing specimens {{to be used in}} research without consent of the individuals who provided the materials. Such materials are an important resource for biomedical research and have been responsible for many scientific advances. However, some may object to at least some uses of their biological materials. Most recently, the case of Catalona v. Washington University drew attention to some of the legal and ethical issues that arise in research involving stored biological materials. The case arose from a dispute between, Dr. Catalona, an internationally known prostate cancer researcher and his former academic institution regarding who should have control of the biological materials collected over decades and stored for use in research. Several research participants who donated their biological materials and wished their materials to go to Dr. Catalona, rather than staying at Washington University joined the lawsuit, asserting that they should have a right to control how their biological materials were used. As has been the case in other cases, the Catalona court showed little sympathy to the research participants’ claims, particularly when those interests may impede medical research that may benefit society. Consistent with the federal regulations regarding such research, the Catalona court saw little harm in using the research participants’ stored biological materials in research, even though, in this instance, the research participants were objecting to the continued use, at least at Washington University. The underlying assumptions of the federal regulations are that there are few risks and that most people would agree to such participation. However, those assumptions may no longer be valid in an era of whole genome sequencing and large DNA databases, especially as genomic research is increasingly being done on sensitive issues such as IQ, ancestry, and personality traits. Moreover, those assumptions are not reasonable in the face of objections. In this article, I argue {{that it is time to}} reconsider our regulatory approach to research involving stored biological materials to better reflect the risks presented by such research and the concerns that some people have about use of their materials. In the first section, I analyze the court cases that address research with stored biological materials to identify how courts’ have characterized research participants’ interests in their materials. In the second section, I analyze how the federal regulations governing human subjects research protect those interests, and the limitations of those protections. In the third section, I present empirical data from a national survey of IRB Chairs that demonstrates that IRB Chairs often are reluctant to apply the approaches available under the federal regulations to allow research on stored materials without consent when the proposed use is different from the purpose for which the materials were originally collected and empirical data regarding investigator practices in such research. I also evaluate empirical data from the literature concerning participant preferences regarding consent and control over their donated biological materials. The combination of these data suggests a preference for recognizing donor choice over the materials that is not fully represented in the court opinions and in the federal regulations. In the final section, I make recommendations for changing the federal regulations and guidance to take into account the changing scientific landscape, risks to participants, and preferences expressed in practices, without unnecessarily impeding research involving stored biological materials...|$|E
