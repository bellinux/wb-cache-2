25|$|A {{good example}} of its {{replacement}} was the refitting of the Doolittle Raiders with a simple <b>iron</b> <b>sight.</b> Designed by Capt. C. Ross Greening, the sight was mounted to the existing pilot direction indicator, allowing the bombardier to make corrections remotely, like the bombsights of an earlier era.|$|E
25|$|The firearm uses a fixed, {{polygonal}} {{rifled barrel}} (hexagonal with a 250mm twist rate) and a fixed notched <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced {{through the use}} of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{reflector}} sight {{originated in}} 1900 with Irish optical designer and telescope maker Howard Grubb in patent No.12108. Grubb conceived of his [...] "Gun Sight for large and small Ordnance" [...] as a better alternative to the difficult to use <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> while avoiding the telescopic sight's limited field of view, greater apparent target speed, parallax errors, and the danger of keeping the eye against an eye stop. In the 1901 the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society he described his invention as: ...|$|E

50|$|For {{precision}} {{applications such}} as hunting or sniping, the <b>iron</b> <b>sights</b> are usually replaced by a telescopic <b>sight.</b> <b>Iron</b> <b>sights</b> may still be fitted alongside other sighting devices (or {{in the case of}} some models of optics, incorporated integrally) for back-up usage.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> {{line was}} {{redesigned}} and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for [...] {{with an additional}} ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for [...] in [...] increments. This sight line like other aperture sight lines proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel rear sight elements sight lines offered by Mauser, previous Lee–Enfields or the Buffington battle sight of the 1903 Springfield.|$|E
2500|$|The No. 5 <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> {{line was}} similar to the No. 4 marks and {{featured}} a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for [...] with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for [...] in [...] increments. The No. 5 Mk I was popular with soldiers owing to its light weight, portability and shorter length than a standard Lee–Enfield rifle. The No. 5 was first issued to the British 1st Airborne Division and used during their liberation of Denmark and Norway in 1945. BSA-Shirley, Birmingham produced 81329 rifles and ROF Fazakerley, Liverpool 169807 rifles.|$|E

50|$|While <b>iron</b> <b>sights</b> are {{basically}} very simple, that simplicity also {{leads to a}} staggering variety of different implementations.

50|$|The {{complementing}} rear sight element {{may be an}} open type <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> or an aperture sight as used in ghost {{rings and}} target aperture sights such as a target shooting diopter sight.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} open <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> aiming elements {{consisted of}} relatively coarse rugged aiming elements making the sightline suitable for rough handling and low light usage, but less suitable for aiming at small point targets. The tracks {{of the rear}} sight obstructed the view to the sides during aiming. The sights were designed with distant area fire targets like charging horseman units in mind, so the standard <b>iron</b> <b>sight</b> line could be calibrated for very long ranges. Military doctrine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries considered firing at distant area targets, where an officer would call out the range and the soldiers shot in volley, normal.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic sights {{provide some}} {{tactical}} disadvantages. Snipers rely on stealth and concealment {{to get close}} to their target. A telescopic sight can hinder this because sunlight may reflect from the lens and a sniper raising his head to use a telescopic sight might reveal his position. The famous Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä preferred to use <b>iron</b> <b>sights</b> rather than telescopic sights to present less of a target. Harsh climate can also cause problems for telescopic sights as they are less rugged than <b>iron</b> <b>sights.</b> Many Finnish snipers in WWII used <b>iron</b> <b>sights</b> heavily because telescopic sights did not cope with very cold Finnish winters.|$|R
5000|$|The Semi Auto Standard {{division}} {{is limited to}} <b>iron</b> <b>sights</b> only, bipods are not allowed and muzzle brakes have to be within the maximum dimensions of 30x90 mm (approx. 1x3.5 inches). A long sight radius is desirable as it helps even target and sight focus, and thus <b>iron</b> <b>sighted</b> rifles often have longer barrels with the front sight attached {{to the end of}} it. Many Standard top competitors use the longer 50 cm (20") barrel over the 46 cm (18") to achieve longer <b>sight</b> radius. Any <b>iron</b> <b>sights</b> can be used, and both [...] "globe" [...] and [...] "post" [...] front sights are popular.|$|R
