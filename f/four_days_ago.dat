The scouts brought back fearful news that the 17th JÃ¤gers relocated to Skvira, a full day's march west of Bila Tserkva.

[...] "I started recording <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. [...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. We would just hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done {{a lot of things in}} my career, had a lot of fun, but we had more fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything. [...] this kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off.

2500|$|In the {{following}} days, while at {{work with the}} other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago.</b> Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E

The album was recorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis in August 2007, with Steve Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, and Steve Potts (a.k.a. The MGs), with Lester Snell on keyboards. Cropper also co-produced the album with Sebastian, which was recorded on analogue tape live in the studio. Sebastian wrote about his time in Memphis {{in a series of}} blogs for Australian newspapers, [...] "I started recording <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> with the band members from Booker T and the MGs.

[...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "This kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. [...] he just took us by storm." [...] Shortly after Sebastian's return to Australia it was announced that The MGs would tour Australia with him in early 2008. The Memphis Album debuted at number three in November 2007, and was the seventh highest selling Australian artist album of the year. The critically acclaimed album reached double platinum certification in 2008. The Memphis Flyer, a weekly alternative newspaper serving the Memphis area wrote a series of articles about Sebastian recording with The MGs. AllMemphisMusic, which specialises in playing music originating from Memphis, began playing The Memphis Album songs in late December 2007. They also had two special programs featuring songs from the album and interviews with some of the people involved in recording it.|$|E
