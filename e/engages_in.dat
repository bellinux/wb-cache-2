A qualitative approach through interviews was used and a total of eight teachers were interviewed. The result showed that there were several motives to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> outdoor education.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport have different drinking outcome expectancies and normative beliefs than {{students who are}} not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. A cross-sectional survey of university students in England in 2008 – 2009 was undertaken. A questionnaire battery, including the Drinking Expectancies Questionnaire (DEQ) and a measure of normative beliefs, was completed by 770 students from seven universities across England. Responses from 638 students who were not abstaining from alcohol were analyzed. Students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport have significantly higher drinking expectancies of assertion compared with students not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. Moreover, students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport consistently report higher personal alcohol consumption and higher perceptions of consumption in those around them than students not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. Both assertion and the perception that students around them drink heavily provide only a partial explanation for why students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport drink more than those not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. Further research is required to identify the reasons for heavy drinking among students involved in university sport in England...|$|R
