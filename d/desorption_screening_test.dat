A total of 563 S. aureus isolates were tested. Two hundred ninety-six of the isolates were methicillin-susceptible isolates from cultures of blood from consecutive patients. Also, 267 methicillin-resistant isolates that comprised 248 different phage types were tested. Methicillin resistance {{was defined as the}} presence of the mecA gene. Of the 267 mecA gene-positive isolates, 263 were positive by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (sensitivity, 98. 5 %), and all the mecA-gene negative strains were negative by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (specificity, 100 %).

40|$|Summary. The {{accuracy}} (sensitivity and specificity) {{of a new}} <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> can {{be compared}} with that of a standard test by applying both tests to a group of subjects in which disease status can be determined by a gold standard (GS) test. However, it is not always feasible to administer a GS test to all study subjects. For example, a study is planned to determine whether a new <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> for cervical cancer (“ThinPrep”) is better than the standard test (“Pap”), and in this setting it is not feasible (or ethical) to determine disease status by biopsy in order to identify women with and without disease for participation in a study. When determination of disease status is not possible for all study subjects, the relative accuracy of two <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> can still be estimated by using a paired screen-positive (PSP) design in which all subjects receive both <b>screening</b> <b>tests,</b> but only have the GS test if one of the <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> is positive. Unfortunately in the cervical cancer example, the PSP design is also infeasible because it is not technically possible to administer both the ThinPrep and Pap at the same time. In this article, we describe a randomized paired screen-positive (RPSP) design in which subjects are randomized to receive one of the two <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> initially, and only receive the other <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> and GS if the first <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> is positive. We derive maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals for the relative accuracy of the two <b>screening</b> <b>tests,</b> and assess the small sample behavior of these estimators using simulation studies.

The goal of our review is to inform research on the design and promotion of public health programs to increase cancer screening. MethodsUsing the PubMed and EconLit databases, we identified studies published in English from January 1990 through July 2013 that measured preferences for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> attributes using conjoint analysis or a discrete-choice experiment. We extracted data on study characteristics and results. We categorized studies by whether attributes evaluated included <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> health care delivery characteristics, or both. ResultsTwenty-two studies met the search criteria. Colorectal cancer was the most commonly studied cancer of the 3. Fifteen studies examined only <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> attributes (efficacy, process, test characteristics, and cost). Two studies included only health care delivery attributes (information provided, staff characteristics, waiting time, and distance to facility). Five studies examined both <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> and health care delivery attributes.

40|$|SEVERAL issues {{pertinent}} to the validation of <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> and to the evaluation of screening programmes have evolved, largely in the epidemiological and general medical literature (Vecchio, 1966; Holland, 1974; Henderson, 1976). For this reason, laboratory scientists interested {{in the development and}} validation of carcinogen <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> may not be fully aware of some useful concepts. The paper reviews several such concepts and their relationships. These relationships explain, for example, why the "predictive value", although frequently used as an index of the utility of a <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> is not well suited for that purpose. A carcinogen <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> is usually evaluated by applying it to a group of substances, each of which is considered to be, or not to be, a carcinogen according to some selected criteria (i. e. animal or human carcinogenesis).
