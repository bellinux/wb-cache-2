500|$|In {{conveying}} his {{impressions of}} Falstaff, Hazlitt first emphasises the sheer physical bulk that we remember him by: [...] "We are as {{well acquainted with}} his person as his mind, and his jokes come upon us with double force and relish from the quantity of flesh through which they make their way, as <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fat sides with laughter [...]|$|E
500|$|During {{spawning}} season, the fins and {{underside of}} male bowfin often {{change in color}} to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. [...] The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie {{side by side in}} the nest. [...] She deposits her eggs while <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.|$|E
2500|$|Joel Coen {{seems to}} agree. In an {{interview}} with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that [...] "overall [...] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' <b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'" [...] In addition, Ethan Coen states that [...] "we're not conscious of it, [...] {{to the extent that}} we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [...] it is by accident." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2013, at the hospital, Maxine tells Cameron she's glad Abigail has {{someone to}} lean on with {{everything}} she's going through right now. He admits they're just friends and looks deflated. Maxine's sorry she assumed. He leaves. She can tell he's got it bad for Abby. In the square Gabi walks by, she drops her books and Cameron sees. He helps pick them up. Nick walks over, picks up Gabi's bag {{and hands it to}} Cameron saying [...] "You missed one." [...] It's awkward. He leaves and goes back to the hospital and texts Chad. They need to talk. Maxine tells Cam to find Gabi in the waiting room. She has questions about her brother's therapy. Cameron heads over and overhears Abigail tell Gabi she and Chad 'did it'. <b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head and looks upset. Cameron decides to pay Chad a visit and asks how could he lie to Abby and set her up? Chad notices his computer is open to the treatment search and feigns a headache. He closes the laptop as Cam gets him water. Chad apologizes that he had to lose in this situation. Cameron's worried about Abigail's vulnerability. Chad says Abby wanted it and gives him a reason to live. Cameron won't say how he found out but agrees to stay out of it. Chad realizes Cameron loves her. Cameron only says Abby's his friend and he cares for them both before going back to the hospital where he bumps into Abby and they share an awkward moment.|$|E

6000|$|CUTHBERTSON (impatiently). Ibsen, man: Ibsen. (He {{goes out}} by the {{staircase}} door followed by Sylvia, who kisses her hand to the bust as she passes.

6000|$|... (There is a salt {{smile on}} his face as <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head to her. He lets the cloak slip to the ground.
