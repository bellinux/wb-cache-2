5|$|Grünschloß speculates the UFO-contact {{narratives}} may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the group's {{development of}} space opera, specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description {{of life in}} Xenu's time to statements by George Adamski, a UFO contactee of the 1950s.

5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> respiration {{as it does in}} birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of {{sections of the}} rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses {{that could have been}} one of the factors causing the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Human beings <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{the ecology}} of Presque Isle {{since at least the}} Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates {{that they may have}} started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures are likely to <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, {{there is no evidence}} for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1995, Ike and Clara Altgens {{were found}} dead in {{separate}} rooms in their home in Dallas. A Houston Chronicle article quoted a nephew, Dallas attorney Ron Grant, as saying his aunt Clara had been very ill with heart trouble and other health problems, {{and both of them}} had long suffered from the flu. Carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty furnace may also <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> their deaths. Altgens was survived by three nephews, and his wife by two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the {{diversification of}} skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection {{is influenced by}} many things. The parental investment may {{shed some light on}} the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E

5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E
5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought to have been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the small}} range of the bluebuck {{at the time of}} European {{settlement}} of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 years ago, but the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E
