500|$|The company traces {{its history}} to a <b>groundwood</b> pulp <b>mill</b> {{established}} in 1865. Car tyre production began in 1932 by Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd). A three-company merger formed the Nokia Corporation in 1967; Nokian Tyres Limited {{was established in}} 1988 as a joint venture company split from the conglomerate as Nokia Corporation started focusing entirely on the mobile communications business. Nokian is [...] "Nokia" [...] in the genitive, thus Nokian renkaat meaning [...] "Tyres of Nokia". The European subsidiary of Japanese tyre company Bridgestone is currently the largest minority shareholder.|$|R
50|$|Another {{operation}} {{that is no}} longer performed relates to storing groundwood. In 1934, a large concrete pad was constructed for storing “lapped groundwood pulp. Because of the water-driven <b>groundwood</b> <b>mill,</b> at time of high water availability, excess groundwood was manufactured for use when the water flow was low. Separation of frozen laps was difficult during cold Minnesota winters. When separation was not possible with crowbars, dynamite was used. The lapped groundwood pulp was then brought into the mill and placed into beaters for repulping and use.|$|E
50|$|After Törngren {{had decided}} to start {{business}} with Wasastjerna, he had sold the lot at Tammerkoski. His wife's younger brother Fredrik Idestam had built there a <b>groundwood</b> <b>mill,</b> which he later moved to Nokia. In 1877 Törngren founded company Tampereen Asfaltti- ja Kattohuopatehdas Oy ("Tampere Asphalt- and Roof Membrane Works") that bought the old factory and converted it for asphalt membrane production. Due to new fire protection regulations, the material had high demand and it was applied on roofs in urban areas and railway stations. Törngren grew the business aggressively, and once again fell into financial troubles. He sold the business and moved to Pirkkala, where he developed grain drying concepts, which were granted a patent.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{prominent}} development stage of Kondopoga Pulp & Paper Mill took place {{according to two}} CC CPSU and USSR Council of Ministers’ resolutions (1960 and 1976). Four paper machines with total capacity of 305,600 tpy of newsprint were commissioned 1960 through 1965 including: 1960 — PM 6 with 37,000 tpy of newsprint; 1961 — PM5 with 52,000 tpy of newsprint; 1963 — PM 4 with 108,000 tpy of newsprint. It became USSR’s first wide high speed machine. PM 4 was equipped with the latest state-of-the-art machinery at that time. October 1965 — PM7 with 108.000 tpy came on stream. The machine had been the industry’s leader in newsprint production for many years. A new <b>groundwood</b> <b>mill</b> was built in those years featuring 202B Europe grinders and related cleaner equipment.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} fouling of {{conventional}} filter fabrics and membranes was studied. In {{the beginning of}} the thesis fouling and how it can be measured and predicted is reviewed. Information on different methods on how fouling canbe decreased or cleaned away is also given. The experimental part is divided into two sections; fabric filtration and membrane filtration. Fouling of the filter fabrics was studied with silica or cupper slurries and fouling of the membranes was studied with pulp and paper mill waters. The fouled filter materials were characterised according to many different methods. The most useful way to observe fouling is to measure the changes in the permeate flux. Fouling can also be seen visually e. g. with scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, also the reason for the fouling in question might be found. Different filtration characteristics affect fouling e. g. as the filtration pressure was increased it did not have much influence on the permeate flux, but the pressure caused the membrane to get fouled faster. Also, an increase of shear rate on the membrane surface decreased fouling. Different pretreatment methods for the effluent were tested in membrane filtration to decrease fouling. The tested methods; biological treatment, ozonation, enzymatic treatment and flocculation, did not have a clear influence on the fouling of the membrane, but e. g. a biological treatment combined with ultrafiltration made the tested <b>groundwood</b> <b>mill</b> circulation water purer than ultrafiltration alone...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) {{is widely}} applied in {{different}} separation {{processes in the}} pulp and paper industry. The growing need to protect the environment, a lack of pure water and an interest in producing high-value chemicals from compounds present in process waters will probably {{lead to an increase}} in the use of UF in the pulp and paper industry. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of a UF process depends on the applied membrane. The membrane should have a high and stable filtration capacity, a particular selectivity and a long operational lifetime. To meet these requirements a membrane should have a low fouling tendency. In addition, it should withstand the prevailing operational and chemical conditions. This thesis evaluates the performance and applicability of the regenerated cellulose (RC) membranes 00030 T and C 2 in the treatment of pulp and paper mill process waters based on the requirements above. The results demonstrated that both the tested RC membranes fulfilled well the requirement of high filtration capacity. In addition, in the filtration of a paper mill clear filtrate (CF) the RC membranes were not as greatly affected by variations in the CF quality as a polysulphone membrane. Furthermore, due to their extreme hydrophilicity and weak charge the fouling tendency of the membranes can be expected to be low in pulp and paper mill filtration applications. It is, however, known that fouling cannot be totally avoided even when the membrane is chosen very carefully. This study indicated that carbohydrates influenced negatively on permeability and caused fouling in the filtration of <b>groundwood</b> <b>mill</b> circulation water. Thus, a pre-treatment effectively reducing the amount of carbohydrates might help to maintain a stable capacity. However, the results of the thesis also showed that the removal of some of the possible foulants might just increase the harmful effect of others. Multivariate examination was useful in the understanding of the complicated factors causing the unstable capacity. The thesis also revealed that the 00030 T and C 2 membranes can be used at high pressure (max. tested pressure 12 bar). The C 2 membrane, having a sponge-like substructure, was more pressure resistant, and its performance was more stable at high pressure compared to the UCO 30 T membrane containing macrovoids in its substructure. Both tested membranes can, according to the results, also be used at temperatures as high as 70 °C in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. However, the use at extreme conditions might cause faster ageing of the membranes compared to ageing in neutral conditions. The thesis proved that both the tested RC membranes are very suitable for pulp and paper mill applications and that the membranes can be utilised in processes operating in challenging conditions. Thus, they could be used in more demanding applications than supposed earlier...|$|E
40|$|Industries, such as {{the pulp}} and paper industry, {{generate}} high-temperature process waters and wastewaters. Biological treatment at high temperatures may be an attractive option {{for the treatment of}} hot or concentrated wastewaters. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the feasibility of thermophilic aerobic wastewater treatment in laboratory experiments, in which thermophilic processes were compared with mesophilic processes. A combined thermophilic-mesophilic treatment was used to improve thermophilic effluent quality. Also the performance of a pilot thermophilic aerobic suspended carrier biofilm process (SCBP) treating <b>groundwood</b> <b>mill</b> circulation water (GWM) was studied on mill premises. Thermophilic and mesophilic activated sludge processes (ASPs) were compared under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) 18 - 8 h and volumetric loading rates (VLRs) 2. 5 - 6 kg CODfilt m- 3 d- 1. In thermophilic ASPs total COD (CODtot) and GFA-filtered COD (CODfilt) removals were lower (65 - 75 %) than in the mesophilic (85 - 90 %). Both ASPs gave similar CODsol (0. 45 ?m-filtrated COD) removals (90 %), whereas effluents from the thermophilic ASPs had notably higher CODcol (calculated COD between 0. 45 - 1. 6 ?m) values (460 ? 170 mg l- 1) than mesophilic effluents (6 ? 5 mg l- 1). The increased CODcol was due to the high density of dispersed particles, which were unable to aggregate and settle under thermophilic conditions. These bacteria were mostly non-viable gram-positive, whereas small (< 1 ?m) thermophilic gram-negative bacteria were dominant in the settled flocs. Combined thermophilic-mesophilic treatment had CODfilt removals of 80 - 85 % with HRTs from 36 to 18 h. Thermophilic treatment removed CODsol (90 %), whereas mesophilic post-treatment removed free bacteria from the thermophilic effluent, measured as 90 - 100 % CODcol removals. Between HRTs of 12 - 18 h the thermophilic ASP and SCBP removed 60 ? 13 % and 62 ? 7 % of CODfilt, respectively, whereas with HRT of 7 - 8 h the removals were 48 ? 1 % and 69 ? 4 %. A two-stage thermophilic SCBP produced 49 - 77 % dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removals at VLRs of 3 - 14 kg CODfilt m- 3 d- 1 and HRTs of 2 - 8 h, whereas the single reactor produced 40 - 67 % DOC removals at VLRs of 7 - 28 kg CODfilt m- 3 d- 1 and HRTs of 1 - 4 h. The two-stage thermophilic process was particularly resistant to process upsets. In conclusion, thermophilic aerobic wastewater treatment proved operable under varying parameters and yielded CODsol removals comparable to those obtained from mesophilic treatment. Increased temperature reduced CODtot and CODfilt removals. Tuottavassa teollisuudessa, esimerkiksi paperin ja massan valmistuksessa, muodostuvat kuumat prosessi- ja jätevedet tyypillisesti viilennetään ennen niiden biologista käsittelyä. Juhani Suvilammen väitöstutkimus osoittaa, että jätevesiä voidaan käsitellä myös korkeissa lämpötiloissa, mistä on monia etuja. Tutkimuksen tuloksia voidaan hyödyntää kuumien jätevesien biologisessa aerobisessa käsittelyssä ja erityisesti metsäteollisuuden vesikiertoja suljettaessa. Tutkittu prosessi on aikaisempaa yksinkertaisempi, koska lämmönvaihtimien tarve pienenee. Käsittely on siten kustannustehokkaampi ja toiminnaltaan varmempi. Lämpötilan noustessa reaktionopeudet kasvavat, joten prosessi voidaan toteuttaa myös pienemmässä reaktorissa. Pienemmät reaktorit puolestaan merkitsevät alhaisempia investointeja. Prosessi tuottaa myös vähemmän lietettä, mikä lisää sen kustannustehokkuutta. Kuumien jätevesien käsittelyä on kuitenkin täydennettävä hienoaineksen poistamisella, jotta saavutettaisiin sama laatu kuin alhaisemmissa lämpötiloissa...|$|E

40|$|Wastewaters of {{the wood}} {{processing}} into groundwood are characterized by increased concentrations of organic contaminants (oils, resin acid, lignin (polymeric phenols), lignin salts (sulphonates, phenoxides), tannins, triglycerides, waxes, free long-chained fatty acids and other). Organic compounds which appear as colour come from extracted lignin, tannins and resin acids. Wood processing effluents are often resistant to degradation using biological methods, and are not removed effectively by conventional physicochemical treatment methods, such as coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and ozonation. For processing of those effluents it is often necessary to link different methods of purification, {{and one of the}} alternative methods is sorption. In this work the removal of organic pollutants was tested from effluent of the production of mechanically <b>milled</b> <b>groundwood</b> by using sorption to clinoptilolite tuff and to samples of tuff which were modified using the solutions of cationic surfactant- hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) of different concentrations. The sorption processes of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were researched on the clinoptilolite tuff from Turkey (Aegean Region Turkey, Bigadic), which contains more than 70 % of clinoptilolite, and in smaller mass fraction quartz and opal-CT are present. The tested effluent has the following characteristics: chemical oxygen demand (COD) : 13200 mg dm- 3, total organic carbon (TOC) : 3010 mg dm - 3, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) : 470 mg dm- 3, colour: 681 Pt Co, turbidity: 799 NTU, pH 4. 8. All testing was done without the adjustment of pH. The conventional process of pre-processing of effluent by coagulation with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O) was tested and the application ofHDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff with the intention of further decrease in organic burden of wastewater. In the Fig. 1 A the results of the HDTMA uptake onto clinoptilolite tuff are shown, and in Fig. 1 B the pertaining zeta potentials of the samples are shown. HDTMA cations were essentially quantitatively taken up by the clinoptilolite tuff up to loading level of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 -(Fig. 1 A). The results of the zeta potential measurements show that the negative surface charge changed to positive after modification with surfactant solutions (Fig. 1 B). HDTMA cations form a stable organophilic coating on the clinoptilolite surface, and above surfactant loading level of 0. 110 mmol g - 1 (isoelectric point), a second layer of HDTMA+ cations reverses the surface charge into positive. The optimal mass concentration of coagulant AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O for the tested wastewater is γ = 0. 8 g dm - 1 (Figs. 2 A and 2 B). Zeta potential of the solution above sediment received by coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration γ= 0. 8 g dm - 3 is ζ= - 3. 92 mV. The efficiency of removing the turbidity (Table 1) and COD is η = 67 % (from 799 to 263 NTU) and 54 % (from 13 200 to 6 040 mg dm - 3). The efficiency of removing solved organic carbon and colour is significantlylesser: 22. 7 % (from 3010 to 2322 mg dm- 3) and η = 33. 0 % (from 681 to 457 Pt Co). By processing the solutions received after coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration of 0. 8 g dm - 3, with natural tuff and organo-zeolites whose loading are: 0. 074; 0. 123; 0. 164 and 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, TOC was decreased from γ= 2322 mg dm- 3 to the following: γ= 2042, 1976, 1945, 1907 and 1821 mg dm - 3 and was sorbed: q = 28. 0; 34. 6; 37. 7; 41. 5; and 50. 1 mg g - 1 TOC (Fig. 3 A). Using the sample of organo-zeolite with loading of 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, the efficiency of removing the organic carbon was improved from η= 22. 7 % to 40. 0 %. The efficiency of discolouring the tested solutions also increases with the change of the surface charge of organo-zeolites from negative to positive(Fig. 3 B). The efficiency of removing the colour by using the natural tuff was improved from η= 33. 0 % to η = 40. 0 %, and by using the organo-zeolite with loading of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA to η= 76. 3 %. In order for the biodegradation of the processes effluents to be tested, the rations of BOD 5 /COD are predetermined (Figs. 4 A and 4 B). According to literature data, the good value of biodegradation is the ratio of BOD 5 /COD higher than 0. 5. The tested effluent was characterized as having particularly poor biodegradation. After processing the effluent with coagulation and organo-zeolite (0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA), the biodegradation has not shown significant improvement. It could be concluded that HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff can be used for discolouring and purification of the examined wastewater in one part of wastewater treatment which combines and some other physicochemical and/or biological purification methods...|$|R
