In his book Emotion and Reason: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Decision Making, Alain Berthoz aims to answer these questions and to shed light on the neural underpinnings of the highly familiar, yet so puzzling, phenomenon of making decisions. In 295 pages, he gives a comprehensive and entertaining overview of the neuroscience of choice behaviour. The focus of the later chapters is preluded by the first section of the book, entitled ‘Is decision making rational or irrational?’. In this section, Berthoz gives a brief account of the current controversy of whether decision making is just about computing gains, losses, and probabilities, or whether it is more than that. Decision making is of course more than that as emotional, social, and other factors frequently bias a person's judgment to deviate from the path of rationality, hence the book's title...|$|R

We want to {{quantify}} reciprocity between individuals in weighted networks, {{and we want to}} discover whether it depends on their topological features (like degree, or number of common neighbors). Here we answer these questions, by studying the call- and SMS records of millions of mobile phone users from a large city, with more than 0. 5 billion phone calls and 60 million SMSs, exchanged over a period of six months. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose a novel distribution, the Triple Power Law (3 PL), that fits the reciprocity behavior of all 3 datasets we study, with a better fit than older competitors, (2) 3 PL is parsimonious; it has only three parameters and thus avoids over-fitting, (3) 3 PL can spot anomalies, and we report the most surprising ones, in our real networks, (4) We observe that the degree of reciprocity between users is correlated with their local topological features; reciprocity is higher among mutual users with larger local network overlap and greater degree similarity. ...|$|R
