5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and <b>environmental</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plant ecology is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to <b>environmental</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
40|$|Predicting how {{biodiversity}} will {{be affected}} and will respond to human-induced <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> {{is one of the}} most critical challenges facing ecologists today. Here, we put current <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> and their effects on biodiversity in a macroevolutionary perspective. We build on research in palaeontology and recent developments in phylogenetic approaches to ask how macroevolution can help us understand how <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> have affected biodiversity in the past, and how they will affect biodiversity in the future. More and more paleontological and phylogenetic data are accumulated, and we argue that much of the potential these data have for understanding <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> remains to be explored...|$|R

5|$|Postglacial <b>environmental</b> <b>change</b> {{throughout}} eastern Beringia {{brought about}} wholesale changes in vegetation, the regional extinction {{of much of}} the megafauna, and the entrance of Homo sapiens. The large Late Pleistocene carnivores that were more carnivorous than their competitors faced greater vulnerability to extinction. The Beringian cave lion, saber-toothed cat, and short-faced bear went extinct {{at the same time as}} their large megafaunal prey. The omnivorous coyote, American black bear, brown bear, puma and bobcat survived. Both the Beringian wolf and the dire wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive. One extinction theory holds that the Beringian wolf was outcompeted and replaced by the ancestor of the modern gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The {{ancestors of}} the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, {{as is the case}} for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced hyena. As {{there is no evidence of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>change</b> being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.|$|E

25|$|Microfossils, {{particularly}} from deep-sea sediments, also provide {{some of the}} most important records of global <b>environmental</b> <b>change</b> on long, medium or short timescales. Across vast areas of the ocean floor, the shells of planktonic micro-organisms sinking from surface waters provide the dominant source of sediment, and they continuously accumulate (typically at rates of 20–50million per million years). Study of changes in assemblages of microfossils and changes in their shell chemistry (e.g., oxygen isotope composition) are fundamental to research on climate change in the geological past.|$|E
40|$|This letter {{reviews the}} {{scientific}} literature on whether and how <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> affect the risk of violent conflict. The available evidence from qualitative case studies indicates that environ mental stress can contribute to violent conflict in some specific cases. Results from quantitative large-N studies, however, strongly suggest {{that we should be}} careful in drawing general conclusions. Those large-N studies that we regard as the most sophisticated ones obtain results that are not robust to alternative model specifications and, thus, have been debated. This suggests that <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> may, under specific circumstances, increase the risk of violent conflict, but not necessarily in a systematic way and unconditionally. Hence there is, to date, no scientific consensus on the impact of <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> on violent conflict. This letter also highlights the most important challenges for further research on the subject. One of the key issues is that the effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> on violent conflict are likely to be contingent on a set of economic and political conditions that determine adaptation capacity. In the authors' view, the most important indirect effects are likely to lead from <b>environmental</b> <b>changes</b> via economic performance and migration to violent conflict. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
