In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and convulsion in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat <b>haemorrhoids.</b> Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E

It may be specially mentioned that Professor Haque is the pioneer in colorectal Surgery in Bangladesh and the Subcontinent. He successfully initiated various modern surgeries of colon and rectum. Such as double stapling of rectum cancer, Longo operation for <b>Haemorrhoid</b> and successful operation of fistula after having frequent unsuccessful operations. Professor Haque popularised the idea of treating 70-80% of <b>Haemorrhoid</b> patients with the non-operation procedure such as Rubber Ring Ligation. He has taken the initiative to observe [...] "World Piles & Colorectal Cancer Day" [...] on 20 November in Bangladesh and internationally to increase public awareness.

25|$|Walter Whitehead, , (12 October 1840– 19August 1913) was {{a surgeon}} at various {{hospitals}} in Manchester, England, {{and held the}} chair of Clinical Surgery at the Victoria University of Manchester. He {{was president of the}} British Medical Association in 1902. He once claimed that knowledge of anatomy was an impediment to being a good surgeon but was himself a bold, innovative practitioner of international repute. His procedure for excision of the tongue using scissors and his formulation of a related ointment became a standard treatment, as did a procedure he developed for the treatment of <b>haemorrhoids.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patel's {{position}} {{at the highest level}} in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Mumbai, he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. In addition to collecting funds and selecting candidates, he also determined the Congress stance on issues and opponents. Not contesting a seat for himself, Patel nevertheless guided Congressmen elected in the provinces and at the national level. In 1935 Patel underwent surgery for <b>haemorrhoids,</b> yet continued to direct efforts against plague in Bardoli and again when a drought struck Gujarat in 1939. Patel guided the Congress ministries that had won power across India with the aim of preserving party disciplinePatel feared that the British would take advantage of opportunities to create conflict among elected Congressmen, and he did not want the party to be distracted from the goal of complete independence. Patel clashed with Nehru, opposing declarations of the adoption of socialism at the 1936 Congress session, which he believed was a diversion from the main goal of achieving independence. In 1938 Patel organised rank and file opposition to the attempts of then-Congress president Subhas Chandra Bose to move away from Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance. Patel saw Bose as wanting more power over the party. He led senior Congress leaders in a protest that resulted in Bose's resignation. But criticism arose from Bose's supporters, socialists, and other Congressmen that Patel himself was acting in an authoritarian manner in his defence of Gandhi's authority.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 review {{found the}} data {{too weak to}} support use of Chinese herbal {{medicine}} (CHM) for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A 2013 review found the research on the benefit and safety of CHM for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is of poor quality and cannot be relied upon to support their use. A 2013 Cochrane review found inconclusive evidence that CHM reduces the severity of eczema. The traditional medicine ginger, which has shown anti-inflammatory properties in laboratory experiments, {{has been used to}} treat rheumatism, headache and digestive and respiratory issues, though there is no firm evidence supporting these uses. A 2012 Cochrane review found no difference in decreased mortality when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2012 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of TCM for people with adhesive small bowel obstruction. A 2011 review found low quality evidence that suggests CHM improves the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome. A 2010 review found TCM seems to be effective for the treatment of fibromyalgia but the findings were of insufficient methodological rigor. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of TCM for the treatment of epilepsy. A 2008 Cochrane review found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving painful menstruation, but the trials assessed were of such low methodological quality that no conclusion could be drawn about the remedies' suitability as a recommendable treatment option. Turmeric has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various conditions. This includes jaundice and hepatic disorders, rheumatism, anorexia, diabetic wounds, and menstrual complications. Most of its effects have been attributed to curcumin. Research that curcumin shows strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have instigated mechanism of action studies on the possibility for cancer and inflammatory diseases prevention and treatment. It also exhibits immunomodulatory effects. A 2005 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for the use of CHM in HIV-infected people and people with AIDS. A 2010 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of Traditional Chinese Herbal Products (THCP) in the treatment of angina. A 2010 Cochrane review found no evidence supporting the use of TCHM for stopping bleeding from <b>haemorrhoids.</b> There was some weak evidence of pain relief.|$|E

500|$|On 18 February 1889, Bernhard Mahler died; {{this was}} {{followed}} {{later in the year}} by the deaths both of Mahler's sister Leopoldine (27 September) and his mother (11 October). From October 1889 Mahler took charge of his four younger brothers and sisters (Alois, Otto, Justine, and Emma). They were installed in a rented flat in Vienna. Mahler himself suffered poor health, with attacks of <b>haemorrhoids</b> and migraine and a recurrent septic throat. Shortly after these family and health setbacks the premiere of the First Symphony, in Budapest on 20 November 1889, was a disappointment. The critic August Beer's lengthy newspaper review indicates that enthusiasm after the early movements degenerated into [...] "audible opposition" [...] after the Finale. Mahler was particularly distressed by the negative comments from his Vienna Conservatory contemporary, Viktor von Herzfeld, who had remarked that Mahler, like many conductors before him, had proved not to be a composer.|$|E

2500|$|Whitehead was {{particularly}} noted for {{the invention of}} two surgical procedures, both of which bear his name. The first related to the surgical removal of <b>haemorrhoids</b> and was described in the BMJ in 1882, with a further study of 300 patients being published in 1887. The technique is rarely used now because it usually left a deformity, which also bore his name, but this is because those performing the operation misunderstood his description of it. The second procedure, which {{was a form of}} glossectomy and earned him international repute, is also not much used today. It concerned removal of carcinoma from the mobile tongue and was described by him in an 1891 paper titled A Hundred Cases Of Entire Excision Of The Tongue. There is a story that this latter procedure was devised when he was irritable due to a hangover and declined the choice of surgical instruments offered to him with the words [...] "for God's sake give me a pair of scissors". Twenty of the patients described in the 1891 paper died post-operatively; he said that he believed all 300 patients documented his 1887 paper had been [...] "completely and permanently cured".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding Traditional Chinese herbal therapy, only few trials {{exist that}} are {{considered}} to be of adequate methodology by modern western medical researchers, and its effectiveness therefore is considered poorly documented. [...] A 2016 Cochrane review found [...] "insufficient evidence that Chinese Herbal Medicines were any more or less effective than placebo or Hormonal Therapy" [...] for the relief of menopause related symptoms. A 2012 Cochrane review found no difference in decreased mortality when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2010 Cochrane review found there is not enough robust evidence to support the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine herbs to stop the bleeding from <b>haemorrhoids.</b> [...] A 2008 Cochrane review found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving painful menstruation, compared to conventional medicine such as NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill, but the findings are of low methodological quality. A 2012 Cochrane review found weak evidence suggesting that some Chinese medicinal herbs have a similar effect at preventing and treating influenza when compared to antiviral medication. Due to the poor quality of these medical studies, it is concluded that there is not enough evidence to support or dismiss the use of Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of influenza. There is a need for larger and higher quality randomized clinical trials to determine how effective Chinese herbal medicine is for treating people with influenza.

40|$|Epidemiological {{features}} of proctological disease {{are not well}} known because available studies have provided variable conclusions. Risk factors fre-quently mentioned include heredity, high socio-economic level, obesity, smoking, a diet rich in fats, alcohol, spices and pepper as well low fluid intake have all been implicated. While treating patients with various ano-rectal pa-thologies, apart from definitive treatment, various ad-ditional or supportive therapies are being advised both by the family physicians and surgeons. These include local applications, sitz baths, modification in the diet and life style. But are these supportive therapies really beneficial or they are just empirical? This paper elaborates the various supportive therapies advocated in the common anal disorders like hemor-rhoids, anal fissure and fistula and summarizes the ad-vantages and pitfalls of these treatment additives.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a multimodal analgesic approach for ligation excision haemorrhoidectomy was evaluated in a prospective series of 62 patients. Opioid was given as intravenous fentanyl intra-operatively, {{as part of}} a standardised general anaesthetic technique, followed by post-operative parenteral fentanyl or oral oxycodone as required. Pre-emptive local anaesthesia was provided via ischiorectal fossae and <b>haemorrhoid</b> pedicle infiltration. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin was administered rectally at the end of surgery and regularly orally for 5 post-operative days. A wide range of pain scores was recorded post-operatively but all mean scores were between 2 and 3. Pain was highest {{at the time of the}} first bowel action but this was successfully managed in the patient's home. Patient satisfaction with their pain management was achieved in 95 % of patients. We conclude that the multimodal analgesia technique combined with pre-operative patient education leads to successful pain control following haemorrhoidectomy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{international}} {{working party}} {{with experience in}} the performance of an alternative <b>haemorrhoid</b> operation through the use of the circular stapler was convened for the purpose of developing a consensus as to the criteria for undertaking this procedure. The agenda consisted of first, naming the operation; second, the indications and contra-indications for its performance; and third, the preferred surgical technique. Among the recommendations for individuals who plan to embark on this surgery are that experience with anorectal surgery and an understanding of anorectal anatomy are requisites; experience with circular stapling devices is essential; and the surgeon must attend a formal course which should include lectures, videos, the application of the instrument in models, and observation of the operation as performed by a surgeon recognized by his or her peers—leading ultimately to undertaking the procedure while being observed by an experienced surgeon. Following satisfactory completion of the above, independent responsibility should be determined by an individual's department of surgery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBoscia albitrunca is a {{medicinal}} plant {{widely used in}} the management of eye related ailments and <b>haemorrhoid</b> diseases. Repeated column fractionation of the n-butanol fraction of a 20 % aqueous methanol leaf extract of B. albitrunca on silica gel and Sephadex LH- 20 columns afforded a phenolic compound identified as martynoside. Structure elucidation of the isolated compound was carried out using spectroscopic techniques. The extracts and isolated compound were evaluated for antimicrobial activities using the micro dilution technique. All the extracts and compound were active against the tested Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for extracts ranged from 390. 0 to 6250 μg/mL and martynoside isolated from the butanol fraction was the most active with the lowest MIC values of 7. 81 and 31. 2 μg/mL against B. subtilis and K. pneumoniae respectively. The activity demonstrated by the extracts and martynoside obtained from B. albitrunca against tested bacteria and fungi suggests that they could be helpful {{in the management of}} eye infections...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. In {{the last}} years many mini-invasive {{approaches}} were developed {{in order to reduce}} postoperative pain and complication after <b>haemorrhoid</b> surgery: one of these alternatives is represented by Hemorpex System, a relatively young technique that combines transanal dearterialization with mucopexy through a dedicated proctoscope. Case Presentation. A 78 -year-old male patient was admitted to the Emergency Department for acute urinary retention and elevated temperature. Hemorpex procedure was performed 4 years before. Clinical, endoscopic, and radiological findings demonstrated the presence of multiple diverticula-like structures fulfilled by purulent fluid and a deep alteration of the normal anatomy of the rectum. He was treated following the standard protocol of acute diverticulitis and full recovery from symptoms was achieved. Discussion. Hemorpex System is a young technique, and nowadays-available studies lack long-term follow-up data. Anatomical changes induced by the procedure are consistent and definitive. Our patient luckily demonstrated a prompt response to conservative treatment, but it {{must be taken into account}} that, in case of medical treatment failure, surgical approach would be necessary and the actual patient anatomical changes could lead the surgeon to unavoidable threatening maneuvers...|$|R
