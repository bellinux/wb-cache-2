500|$|More than 40 {{years after}} the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said [...] "They'd {{decided to do it}} a week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was {{chairman}} of the umpires selection committee." [...] Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler—the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen—instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled [...] Rowan's words at the pre-match function: [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> interesting game".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{members of}} the Australian media alleged a {{conspiracy}} against Meckiff, using words such as [...] "the whole affair smacks of a set-up", [...] "obvious fall-guy", and [...] "sacrificial goat". Several called for Bradman and his colleagues to resign. Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot. Gibbs later claimed that the selection of an extra bowler for the match hinted at fears that Meckiff {{would not be able}} to bowl. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose."

During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He would later say of himself as being [...] "dead for five years", and spent {{the first half of}} the decade [...] "trying to regain an interest in living." [...] Parks later stated, [...] "When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A staff at Warner Bros., a man came into my office and he had a snake and his name was Alice. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business." [...] Speaking about his department during this time, Parks stated, [...] "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> promising market for the artist. Warners soon tired of what I thought was a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in England, Kitty Hart-Moxon became {{interested}} in educating people about the Holocaust by telling her life story to the public. [...] This began with her first book I Am Alive (1961) (see References); this is an account of her life from the day in 1939 when, while away on holiday with her mother, they received a telegram from her father insisting they return at once, through the {{events that led to}} her incarceration in Auschwitz in 1942, to her liberation from Auschwitz on 13 April 1945. [...] Then, in 1978, Yorkshire Television (YTV) producer Peter Morley's team learned about Hart-Moxon while doing background research on a project about women who risked their lives to save others during the Nazi era, and convinced him to meet her. She didn't fit the parameters they'd set for Women of Courage, but after two visits, Morley was so impressed with Hart-Moxon, he submitted a proposal to YTV to accompany her to Auschwitz for her first visit in 33 years and film it, provided she brought along her eldest son, then a young doctor, for emotional support. In his memoirs, Morley wrote, [...] "This, no doubt, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> raw film... I felt this to be a unique opportunity to add fresh insight to the infamy of Auschwitz as had been portrayed in both fictional and non-fictional films and television programmes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, Sharon {{went to the}} Abbott cabin to {{have time}} for herself after the {{breakdown}} of her marriage to Jack. Nick showed up because Noah was ice-skating and fell, suffering hypothermia. After becoming trapped in the cabin during a blizzard, Nick found a letter Sharon wrote to him (but didn't intend to show him) which professed her undying love for him. He confronted her and they made love. Prior to this, Brad {{had come to the}} cabin to profess his love for Sharon. On his way out, he ended up dying by saving Noah from the ice. Discussing the plot, Case said that Sharon wants Nick [...] "more than anyone" [...] but would only have him under [...] "certain terms" [...] which includes him leaving Phyllis. Additionally, she said that she wouldn't want Nick and Sharon reunite if there wasn't any conflict. That April, they were at the cabin again searching for Noah and ended up making love, resulting in Sharon becoming pregnant. During an interview with The Daily News Case said that Nick constantly changing his mind whether to be with Sharon or Phyllis [...] "throws everything into a spin" [...] and causes Sharon to make her decisions [...] "all over again because she has new information". Also weighing in on the reunion, Morrow told TV Guide: [...] "The fans have wanted {{this for a long time}} [...] it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> messy journey getting these two back together as a solid couple, but I am sure it will happen." [...] Sharon briefly lied about the baby's paternity because of Summer becoming ill, and stated that Jack was the father. The truth came out, but Faith [...] "died" [...] at birth, Nick and Sharon grieved the loss of their child.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m {{proud of the fact that}} she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
