40|$|Many {{transportation}} agencies maintain grade as {{an attribute}} in roadway inventory databases; however, {{the information is}} often in an aggregated format. Cross slope is rarely included in large roadway inventories. Accurate methods available to collect <b>grade</b> <b>and</b> cross slope include global positioning systems, traditional surveying, and mobile mapping systems. However, most agencies {{do not have the}} resources to utilize these methods to collect <b>grade</b> <b>and</b> cross slope on a large scale.

5|$|While at {{high school}} in Fayetteville, Skip played for the school's {{football}} team at the quarterback position, bringing moderate success to the program. As a high school junior, he visited Notre Dame and met with head football coach Gerry Faust and head basketball coach Digger Phelps. In his final year of high school, Skip was denied admission to Notre Dame due to average <b>grades</b> <b>and</b> his failure to learn a foreign language. Coaches Faust and Phelps encouraged Skip to enroll at nearby Holy Cross College, located adjacent to the university in Notre Dame, Indiana. After two years of study at Holy Cross, Skip had improved his <b>grades</b> <b>and</b> transferred to Notre Dame. After his first year, Skip {{decided he wanted to}} speak with Coach Faust about walking on to the football team during his senior year. The discussions were cut short, however, as after the 1985 season, Coach Faust resigned. Replacing Faust was Skip's father, Lou, who eagerly accepted his son as a walk-on. Skip began spring practice before the 1986 season as a quarterback, but quickly changed to flanker due to his lack of throwing ability. As a flanker, he earned 54yards on three receptions at the Blue-Gold intra-squad game in the spring of 1986. During the fall of 1986, Skip played in all 11 games on special teams.
