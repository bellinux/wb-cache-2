25|$|Another {{contentious}} issue connected to cryptography in the United States is {{the influence of}} the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy. The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography. DES was designed to be resistant to <b>differential</b> <b>cryptanalysis,</b> a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s. According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered <b>differential</b> <b>cryptanalysis,</b> but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.|$|E
25|$|While DES was {{designed}} with resistance to <b>differential</b> <b>cryptanalysis</b> in mind, other contemporary ciphers {{proved to be}} vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the FEAL block cipher. The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight chosen plaintexts, and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack. In contrast, the scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order 247 chosen plaintexts.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the cryptographic role of random functions used in Generalized Feistel Ciphers in achieving provable security against <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis.</b> The provable security against <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis</b> of block ciphers {{can be estimated}} from the maximum probabilities of differential and linear hull. In case of DES-like block ciphers, these probabilities {{are known to be}} smaller than twice the square of the maximum differential and linear hull probabilities of one-round. Even though differential characteristic and linear approximation probabilities decrease as the serial round iteration number increases, known upper-bounds of probabilities of differential and linear hull are constant and not less than the square or twice the square of the maximum of the probabilities of one-round. It seems an unproven conjecture that increasing the serial iteration number would fail to achieve stronger provable security against <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis.</b> T [...] ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>{{cryptanalysis}}</b> is {{a general}} form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it {{is the study of}} how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} basic form of key {{recovery}} through <b>differential</b> <b>cryptanalysis,</b> an attacker requests the ciphertexts for {{a large number of}} plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least r − 1 rounds, where r is the total number of rounds. The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible, assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible round key. When one round key has been deemed a potential round key considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct round key.|$|E
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>cryptanalysis</b> {{is usually}} a chosen {{plaintext}} attack, meaning that the attacker {{must be able to}} obtain ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of their choosing. There are, however, extensions that would allow a known plaintext or even a ciphertext-only attack. The basic method uses pairs of plaintext related by a constant difference; difference can be defined in several ways, but the eXclusive OR (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a differential. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials (ΔX, ΔY), where ΔY = S(X ⊕ ΔX) ⊕ S(X) (and ⊕ denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box S. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent; in this way, the cipher can be distinguished from random. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than exhaustive search.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} that evaluates provable security against <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis</b> for Feistel ciphers with invertible substitution-diffusion (SD) -based round functions. This algorithm computes an {{upper bound on}} the maximum expected differential or linear probability (MEDP or MELP) {{based on the number}} of rounds. We then apply our algorithm to Camellia (minus FL/FL − 1). Previously, the best upper bounds for Camellia were 2 − 12 (both MEDP and MELP) for 3 + rounds. Our algorithm improves these bounds to 1. 065 × 2 − 28 (MEDP) and 1. 161 × 2 − 27 (MELP) for 6 + rounds. This is a first step toward establishing the provable security of Camellia and related ciphers against <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceDesign of SP {{networks}} {{in which the}} non-linear layer is applied to {{only a part of}} the state in each round was suggested by Gérard et al. at CHES 2013. Besides performance advantage on certain platforms, such a design allows for more efficient masking techniques that can mitigate side-channel attacks with a small performance overhead. In this paper we present generic techniques for <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis</b> of SP networks with partial non-linear layers, including an automated characteristic search tool and dedicated key-recovery algorithms. Our techniques can be used both for cryptanalysis of such schemes and for proving their security with respect to basic <b>differential</b> and linear <b>cryptanalysis,</b> succeeding where previous automated analysis tools seem to fail. We first apply our techniques to the block cipher Zorro (designed by Gérard et al. following their methodology), obtaining practical attacks on the cipher which where fully simulated on a single desktop PC in a few days.
