25|$|Between the Garonne and Loire rivers {{there are}} known to have been at least seventy-seven churches whose naves were covered by a line of domes. <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> in the Périgord region. Most date to the twelfth century and sixty of them survive today. That the domes in this area were {{arranged}} in linear series has suggested the contemporary architecture of Cyprus as the inspiration, which was located on a pilgrimage route to the Holy Land. Cyprus had developed its own style of domed basilica during its period of neutrality between Byzantine and Arab rulers, using three domes of roughly equal size in a line over the nave and very little lighting. There are indications of a connection between Aquitaine and Cyprus just after the First Crusade.|$|E

25|$|Atli is {{a legendary}} version of Attila the Hun {{and the name}} Budli comes from Bleda who was the {{historical}} Attila's elder brother. The name Sörli is given to a brother of Atli only in this text. But in the eddic poem Atlamál hin grœnlenzku (stanza 50), Atli declares {{that he was one}} of four living brothers when his father Budli died and that <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> now dead, slain by his wife Gudrún. In the German Nibelungenlied Attila is called Etzel and said to be son of Botelung, obviously Budlung interpreted as a name. In this account Etzel has a younger brother named Bloedelin who was slain by Dancwart, Hagen's brother. Blowdelin is probably another memory of the historical Bleda. The eddic poem Oddrúnargrátr tells of Atli's sister Oddrún and her forbidden love affair with Gunnar, which was, according to this poem, one of the motivations for Atli's later treachery. Oddrún is also mentioned in Sigurðarkviða hin skamma (stanza 57), in the prose introduction to Dráp Niflunga, and in the Völsunga saga.|$|E

2500|$|Fantasyland is {{the area}} of Disneyland of which Walt Disney said, [...] Fantasyland was {{originally}} styled in a medieval European fairground fashion, but its 1983 refurbishment {{turned it into a}} Bavarian village.

Fantasyland has the most fiber optics in the park; more than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> in Peter Pan's Flight. Sleeping Beauty's Castle features a walk-through story telling of Briar Rose's adventure as Sleeping Beauty.

[...] Time also interviewed a former deputy chief of Nicaraguan military counterintelligence, who stated that he had fled Nicaragua after being ordered to kill 800 Miskito prisoners and {{make it look like}} they had died in combat. Another article described Sandinista neighbourhood [...] "Defense Committees", modeled on similar Cuban Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which according to critics were used to unleash mobs on anyone who was labeled a counterrevolutionary. Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper, La Prensa, was subject to strict censorship. The newspaper's editors were forbidden to print anything negative about the Sandinistas either at home or abroad.|$|E
2500|$|Mad Men {{featured}} {{a significant number}} of products and brands that existed both in the 1960s and at the time of airing, many of them shown as advertising clients, including Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Heineken, Volkswagen, Cadillac, Playtex, Chanel, Spam, Utz potato chips, Maidenform, Gillette, American Airlines and Clearasil. This led to widespread speculation that many or all of the products and brands on the show are the result of paid product placement. In fact, nearly all real products featured were included solely for purposes of realism, with no product placement deals behind them. Showrunner Matthew Weiner said in an interview: [...] "There is very little , and it is an illusion that is propagated by the network to try and get more business. It never works out... Literally I've named four [...] in four seasons and there have probably been a hundred products on the show. <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> made up, no one's paying to be on the show." [...] According to Weiner, the companies that did pay for product placement are Jack Daniel's, Heineken, Unilever and Hilton, though the last was only a payment of gratitude after a storyline involving Hilton had already aired.|$|E
