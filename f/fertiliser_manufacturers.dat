40|$|During the {{processing}} of fish, it is generally only the fillets that are retained while {{the bulk of the}} product is discarded (about two thirds of the whole weight is comprised of guts and frames). Across the seafood industry in southeastern Australia alone, there is an estimate that well over 20, 000 t of fish pro duct waste is produced each year. In some instances this fish waste may be taken from {{the processing}} site to be rendered, but usually it is dumped to landfill at a cost to the processor of up to $ 150 /t. This practice is coming under increased scrutiny due to environmental issues and is becoming an increasing cost burden for the whole industry. Hydrolysed fish waste can be composted with rock phosphate to form an organic/biological solid-phosphate fertiliser. To enable this, relationships need to be formed between seafood industry and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> The seafood industry can process the fish offal through a cost effective hydrolysis system into a stable liquid fish concentrate. This can then be efficiently transported to <b>fertiliser</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> who then can blend this stable liquid fish concentrate with rock phosphate. The mixture can then be inoculated with bacteria and fungi using advanced composting technology. This technology has shown that temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is {{primarily}} on nitrogen removal and secondarily on heavy metal accumulation in unsaturated and saturated vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) treating inorganic industrial wastewater. This thesis is divided into an experimental component and a case study component. Three research themes are presented {{within the scope of}} this thesis. The first theme involves the study of nitrification and denitrification and the characterisation of the respective bacterial communities in unsaturated and semi-saturated VFCWs. The identification of functional bacteria with the aid of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular techniques and the effect of salinity (NaCl) on these bacterial groups is also contained within this theme. The second theme is the use of low cost carbon sources to improve denitrification and nitrogen removal in saturated VFCWs. The third theme of this study is the performance of large scale VFCWs operating at CSBP Ltd, a chemical and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>manufacturer</b> based in Kwinana, Western Australia. The performance of the systems is assessed in regards to nitrogen and heavy metal removal. This theme also covers design and operational recommendations for improved nitrogen removal. Laboratory scale VFCWs planted with Schoenoplectus validus were used {{to assess the impact of}} increasing salinity (up to 40 gNaCl/L) on nitrification and on ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research examining the soil content of total and available phosphorus (PE-R), taking into consideration the activity of alkaline and acid phosphatases. For this study, three soil profiles were sampled in Arenosols at a distance of 0. 8, 2. 0 and 2. 5 km from a nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> Anwil S. A. A control profile was taken from the Tuchola Forest. The soils’ reaction ranged from acidic to very acidic. The humus content in the surface horizons of the sampled profiles was average (1. 26 – 2. 61 %). The lowest PE-R content was found in the profile taken closest (0. 8 km – profile I) to the factory. The distribution index (DI) calculated for available phosphorus pointed towards moderate accumulation, whilst at the same time, the availability index (IM) confirmed low availability, especially in profile I. The activity of alkaline and acid phosphatases, which are the enzymes responsible for phosphorus transformation in the soil, varied depending on the distance from the nitrogen works. The inhibition of alkaline phosphomonoesterases and the stimulation of acid esterases, which were both connected to the examined soil reaction, were observed. The activity of phosphatases, as well as total and available phosphorus content, decreased steeply along the soil profiles. Furthermore, a significant correlation between organic carbon and the activity of alkaline and acid phosphatases (r = 0. 94, p < 0. 05 and r = 0. 67, p < 0. 05, respectively), as well as between the content of PE-R and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (r = 0. 67, p < 0. 05) were recorded. The results suggest the need for further research and monitoring of the Arenosols in the forest affected by the nitrogen works...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen removal {{performance}} and the ammonia-oxidising bacterial (AOB) community were assessed in the batch loaded 1. 3 ha saturated surface vertical flow wetland at CSBP Ltd, a <b>fertiliser</b> and chemical <b>manufacturer</b> located in Kwinana, Western Australia. From September 2008 to October 2009 water quality was monitored and sediment samples collected for bacterial analyses. During the period of study the wetland received an average inflow of 1109 m 3 /day with NH 3 -N = 40 mg/L and NO 3 -N= 23 mg/L. Effluent NH 3 -N and NO 3 -N were on average 31 mg/L and 25 mg/L respectively. The overall NH 3 -N removal rate for the period was 1. 2 g/m 2 /d indicating the nitrifying capacity of the wetland. The structure of the AOB community was analysed using group specific primers for the ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) by terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP) and by clone libraries to identify key members. The majority of sequences obtained were most similar to Nitrosomonas sp. while Nitrosospira sp. was less frequent.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of a hybrid Free Water surface/Vertical flow (FVS/VF) wetland in removing nitrogen from wastewater generated in a <b>fertiliser</b> and chemical <b>manufacturer</b> in Perth, Western Australia during a 14 month period. The constructed wetland currently in use at the fertiliser plant is 12, 825 m (135 x 95 m), planted with Schoenoplectus validus, has a vertical flow design and has been operated FWS/ VF conjugated system with a hydraulic load = 3. 3 cm/d and a retention time of 18 days. Average load removal rates are: 26 % for NH 4 -N, 52 % for N 03 -N and 32 % for TN. Parallel to that, an experiment with wetland mesocosms as conducted, this experiment compared the efficiency of a FWS/ VP wetland (simulation of the industry’s wetland) and an alternative hybrid VP/Horizontal F 1 o (VF/HF) in removing nitrogen from the industry’s wastewater. Systems were planted with Schoenoplectus validus. The performance in nitrogen removal for the FWS/VP mesocosm was superior to the actual wetland’s performance. The best nitrogen removal rate was achieved by the VF/HF system, with the first VF stage alone removing 82. 9 % of ammonia in 2. 88 days while the FWS/ VF moved 8. 2 % of the ammonia in 10. 8 days...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{copper and}} zinc {{distribution in the}} surface layer of sediment and rhizome tissue within the saturated surface vertical flow constructed wetland of CSBP Ltd, a <b>fertiliser</b> and chemical <b>manufacturer</b> located in Western Australia. Sediment and Schoenoplectus validus rhizome samples were collected at various distances from the inlet pipe while water samples are routinely collected. Water samples were analysed for nutrients and metals, sediments were analysed for total and bioavailable metals and rhizomes were analysed for total metals only. Mean influent copper and zinc concentrations were 0. 19 mg/L and 0. 24 mg/L respectively. The distribution of bioavailable Cu and Zn in the top sediment layer follows a horizontal profile. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the bioavailable fraction of these metals in sediments near the inlet pipe (30. 2 mg/kg Cu and 60. 4 mg/kg Zn) is significantly higher than in sediments at the farthest location (10. 3 mg/kg Cu and 26. 1 mg/kg Zn). The average total Cu concentration in the sediment at the 2 m location has reached the 65 mg/kg trigger value suggested by the Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines (ANZEEC 2000). Cu and Zn concentrations in the rhizome of S. validus do not vary significantly among different locations. Whether Cu and Zn concentrations at the CSBP wetland may reach toxic levels to plants and bacteria is still unknown and further research is required to address this issue. The surface component of the wetland favours sedimentation and binding of metals to the organic matter {{on the top of}} the sediment, furthermore, the sediment which tends to be anoxic with reducing conditions acts as a sink for metals...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} in nitrogen removal from wastewater generated at CSBP Ltd <b>fertiliser</b> and chemical <b>manufacturer</b> by two hybrid constructed wetland mesocosms was compared. The mesocosms {{were set up}} {{in order to help}} clarify the reasons why the two year old constructed wetland located at the industrial facility, a 1. 2 ha free water surface/vertical flow conjugated system, has performed under the 50 % removal expectation (16 % for NH 4 +-N, 39 % for NO 3 [...] N and 20 % for total nitrogen). It is believed that the short retention time and insufficient oxygen transfer may be limiting nitrification. A free water surface/vertical flow wetland, simulating the design and operation mode of the industry’s wetland, and a vertical/horizontal flow, an alternative system, were tested. All systems were set in duplicates and planted with Schoenoplectus validus. On average, removals of NH 4 +-N, NO 3 [...] N and total nitrogen (TN) for the free water surface/vertical flow mesocosm were 79 %, 78 % and 79 % respectively, hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 10. 4 days. The vertical/horizontal flow system performed better for ammonium removal (97 %) but it failed to remove nitrate properly (- 10 %), TN removal was 66 %, HRT = 8. 5 days. The vertical flow stage of the vertical/horizontal flow mesocosm alone removed 95 % of the NH 4 +-N and almost doubled the concentration of nitrate in its outflow in 2. 4 days, indicating the nitrification capacity of vertical flow systems. The experimental free water surface/vertical flow system which simulates the CSBP wetland outperformed the full scale one and this may be attributed to the lower hydraulic loading rate received by the mesocosm...|$|R
