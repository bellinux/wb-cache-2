5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs out of the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E

25|$|In January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives {{exposed a}} plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made. Later in March 2000, she {{received}} a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and in the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> {{was found to be}} lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience. In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper. All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.|$|E
40|$|Prevention {{measures}} to reduce deaths and injuries due to domestic fires {{have included the}} provision of self-closing <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> within dwellings. Such an approach however, is reliant on a behavioural response {{on behalf of the}} occupier(s). This research examined occupier behaviour in relation to self-closing <b>fire</b> <b>doors.</b> Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals inhabiting a new home. In all of the properties with self-closing <b>fire</b> <b>doors,</b> the occupants reported interfering with the self-closing mechanism of the doors. A quantitative survey was subsequently undertaken to obtain frequency data. In the majority of dwellings with <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> occupiers reported propping these open in some way, or removing the self-closing mechanism from the door. The accounts suggest that, for <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> to be an effective safety measure within dwellings, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on encouraging occupiers to adopt safe practices in relation to <b>fire</b> <b>doors.</b> Alternatively, other measures will need to be found to address the fire risk...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> have {{apparently}} very large gaps {{at the foot}} of them, an inch or two even, allowing air movement, such as in dormitory facilities. This can lead the occupants of a building to question their status as 'real' <b>fire</b> <b>doors.</b> NFPA 80 allows a maximum door undercut of 3/4 inch however <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> are tested with smaller clearances in accordance with NFPA 252. Corridors have a fire rating of one hour or less, and the <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> in them are required by code to have a fire rating of 1/2 or 1/3 hour, the intent of which is mainly to restrict smoke travel.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the ship also created a number of problems. Although the ship had <b>fire</b> <b>doors,</b> there existed a wood-lined, six-inch opening between the wooden ceilings and the steel bulkheads. This provided the fire with a flammable pathway that bypassed the <b>fire</b> <b>doors,</b> enabling it to spread.|$|R
500|$|Chudleigh's {{town hall}} was {{completed}} in 1895, and opened during a public event on 11 April that year. It was funded by public subscription and built local builder Davis Brothers on donated land. It was built as a [...] weather board building set on stone foundations, with a corrugated iron roof. There was a near tragedy in the hall in late 1922 when a generator caught fire while the hall was being used by 300 people. The inwards opening doors and lack of a <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> were cited as significant problems. Chudleigh had a post office from 1865. Around 1899 it was {{moved to a new}} building though it has since been closed and the building sold as a private home. Chudleigh had a registered maternity hospital in the early 20th century. For some time the town had an Australian rules football club. It closed in the 1930s, reformed in 1939, then finally closed in the 1980s. Telegraph communication followed construction of the railway line in the late 19th century. The first telephones were installed in Chudleigh homes in the 1930s, and mains electricity in the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Before Touraj Moghaddam founded Roksan, he {{had become}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the state of}} the audio arts when he heard his little television set reproduce Thelonious Monk in a more musically satisfying way than his high-end Linn/Naim tri-amped audio system. Through experimentation, he deduced that the existing turntable design failed because the cartridge was not being held still wherever the groove went. He believed that the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant. His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the speed-controlling system. Needing a top plinth roughly an inch (25mm) thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800kg/m3, Moghaddam found suitable material in a <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> with which he built a prototype. His friend Tufan Hashemi – then an investment analyst – heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one. They agreed to team up to start production; Roksan Audio was formed. The Xerxes, introduced in 1985, secured the advocacy of Roger Macer, a successful independent hi-fi retailer in London who sold the then market leader, the Linn Sondek. Hashemi credits Macer with urging him to start satisfying the demand of [...] "dozens or more a week" [...] from his customers. The product, named after the Persian king Xerxes I, was launched at a hi-fi show in 1985 where the Roksan Darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled.|$|E
2500|$|Expanded {{graphite}} {{is made by}} immersing natural {{flake graphite}} in a bath of chromic acid, then concentrated sulfuric acid, which forces the crystal lattice planes apart, thus expanding the graphite. The expanded graphite {{can be used to}} make graphite foil or used directly as [...] "hot top" [...] compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss, or as firestops fitted around a <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe (during a fire, the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread), or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use. After being made into graphite foil, the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the {{observatory}} {{was started by}} Rotch in 1884 using his own private funds, and designed by architects Rotch & Tilden. [...] The original structure consisted of a two-story circular tower and an adjoining housing unit which contained two bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen. [...] In 1889, a two-story east wing was added to provide additional working space for research, domestic chores, and the library. [...] In 1902, a two-story west wing containing a new library was added to provide additional work space. [...] A steel <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> and brick wall connect the library to the earlier masonry structure. [...] A timbrel vault (18 by 35ft) of cohesive tiles spans the library. [...] The timbrel vault tile roof {{is believed to have}} been installed by the Guastavino Company using an extremely tenacious mortar developed by Rafael Guastavino, the founder of the firm.|$|E
2500|$|Leo Sayer (born Gerard Hugh Sayer, 21 May 1948) is a singer, who {{had success}} in the 1970s with hits such as [...] "When I Need You", [...] "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", [...] "Moonlighting" [...] and [...] "Thunder in My Heart". Leo found it {{difficult}} to sleep on his first night in the house as he was forced to share a bed with Donny who was naked, a prospect that Leo found uncomfortable. Leo was a servant during the Master and Servant task. He reverted to mime communication and decided to take a vow of silence, much to the confusion and annoyance of other housemates. He escaped from the house by breaking open a <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> with a broom after hitting a two-way mirror on Day 10, when Big Brother refused to provide him with clean underwear. It was revealed later that he already overlooked clean underwear in his suitcase. He was up for eviction at the time and, though he did not know it, leading the poll.|$|E
