The enhancement in light extraction efficiency is attributed to the decrease in the Fresnel reflection and increase in effective photon escape cone due to graded refractive index and curvature formed between microsphere and free space. The maximum enhancement of light extraction efficiency of InGaN quantum well LEDs was achieved by employing the refractive <b>index</b> <b>matched</b> anatase-TiO mi-crosphere arrays.

The sample is placed on a glass or quartz slide, which is affixed to the prism with an <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> gel. The sample then becomes the surface at which TIR occurs. The probe consists of the sharpened tip of an optical fiber attached to a piezoelectric transducer to control fine motion of the probe tip during scanning. The end of the optical fiber is coupled to a photomultiplier tube, which acts as the detector. The probe tip and piezoelectric transducer are housed within a scanner cartridge mounted above the sample. The position of this assembly is manually adjusted to bring the probe tip within tunnelling distance of the evanescent field.As photons tunnel from the evanescent field into the probe tip, they are conducted along the optical fiber to the photomultiplier tube, where they are converted into an electrical signal. The amplitude of the electrical output of the photomultiplier tube is directly proportional {{to the number of}} photons collected by the probe, thus allowing measurement of the degree of interaction of the probe with the evanescent field at the sample surface. Since this field exponentially decays with increasing distance from the surface, the degree of intensity of the field corresponds to the height of the probe from the sample surface. The electrical signals are sent to a computer where the topography of the surface is mapped based on the corresponding changes in the detected evanescent field intensity.|$|E

50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without <b>index</b> <b>matching.</b> This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E
