40|$|Abstract Background The {{prediction}} of <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> from molecular networks {{is a way}} to test the understanding of essentiality in the context of what is known about the network. However, the current knowledge on molecular network structures is incomplete yet, and consequently the strategies aimed to predict <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> are prone to uncertain predictions. We propose that simultaneously evaluating different network structures and different algorithms representing gene essentiality (centrality measures) may identify <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> in networks in a reliable fashion. Results By simultaneously analyzing 16 different centrality measures on 18 different reconstructed metabolic networks for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that no single centrality measure identifies <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> from these networks in a statistically significant way; however, the combination of at least 2 centrality measures achieves a reliable {{prediction of}} most but not all of the <b>essential</b> <b>genes.</b> No improvement is achieved in the prediction of <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> when 3 or 4 centrality measures were combined. Conclusion The method reported here describes a reliable procedure to predict <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> from molecular networks. Our results show that <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> may be predicted only by combining centrality measures, revealing the complex nature of the function of <b>essential</b> <b>genes.</b> </p...|$|R

This study identified approximately 250 candidate <b>essential</b> <b>genes.</b> As more genomes became available the number of predicted <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> kept shrinking because more genomes shared fewer and fewer genes.

In this study, we wanted to explore the reasons behind such differences in gene essentiality by cross-species comparison of human and mouse. Moreover, we examined <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> that are duplicated in humans are functionally more redundant than that in mouse. The proportion of paralog pseudogenization of <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> is higher in mouse than that of humans.

5000|$|Post-translational {{acetylation}} of the histone H4 N-terminal tail in chromatin {{has been}} associated with severalnuclear processes including transcription. Purification and characterization of a native multi-subunit complex (NuA4) from yeast that acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 have been reported. NuA4 has an apparent molecular mass of 1.3 MDa. All four conserved lysines of histone H4 can be acetylated by NuA4. The catalytic subunit of the complex has been identified as the product of ESA1, an <b>essential</b> <b>gene</b> required for cell cycle progression in yeast. Antibodies against Esa1p specifically immunoprecipitate NuA4 activity whereas the complex purified from a temperature-sensitive esa1 mutant loses its acetyltransferase activity at the restrictive temperature. Additionally, another subunit of the complex has been identified as the product of TRA1, an ATM-related <b>essential</b> <b>gene</b> homologous to human TRRAP, an essential cofactor for c-Myc- and E2F-mediated oncogenic transformation. Finally, the ability of NuA4 to stimulate GAL4-VP16-driven transcription from chromatin templates in vitro is also lost in the temperature-sensitive esa1 mutant. The function of the essential Esa1 protein as the HAT subunit of NuA4 and the presence of Tra1p, a putative [...] activator-interacting subunit, supports an essential link between nuclear H4 acetylation, transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control.|$|E

A gene in the sex-determining region of the short arm of the Y, now referred to as SRY, has been found to direct production of a protein, testis determining factor, which binds to DNA, inducing differentiation of cells derived from the genital ridges into testes.

40|$|<b>Essential</b> <b>genes</b> {{code for}} {{fundamental}} cellular functions {{required for the}} viability of an organism. For this reason, <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> are often highly conserved across organisms.

50|$|If screens for {{essential}} {{genes are}} repeated in independent laboratories, they often result in different gene lists. For instance, screens in E. coli have yielded from ~300 to ~600 essential genes (see Table 1). Such differences {{are even more}} pronounced when different bacterial strains are used (see Figure 2). A common {{explanation is that the}} experimental conditions are different or that the nature of the mutation may be different (e.g. a complete gene deletion vs. a transposon mutant). Transposon screens in particular are hard to reproduce, given that a transposon can insert at many positions within a gene. Insertions towards the 3' end of an <b>essential</b> <b>gene</b> may not have a lethal phenotype (or no phenotype at all) and thus may not be recognized as such.

5000|$|Conserved gene clusters, such as Hox and {{the human}} β-globin gene cluster, may be formed {{as a result of}} the process of gene {{duplication}} and divergence. A gene is duplicated during cell division, so that its descendants have two end-to-end copies of the gene where it had one copy, initially coding for the same protein or otherwise having the same function. In the course of subsequent evolution, they diverge, so that the products they code for have different but related functions, with the genes still being adjacent on the chromosome. Ohno theorized that the origin of new genes during evolution was dependent on gene duplication. If only a single copy of a gene existed in the genome of a species, the proteins transcribed from this gene would be essential to their survival. Because there was only a single copy of the gene, they could not undergo mutations which would potentially result in new genes; however, gene duplication allows essential genes to undergo mutations in the duplicated copy, which would ultimately give rise to new genes over the course of evolution. [...] Mutations in the duplicated copy were tolerated because the original copy contained genetic information for the essential gene's function. Species who have gene clusters have a selective evolutionary advantage because natural selection must keep the genes together. [...] Over a short span of time, the new genetic information exhibited by the duplicated copy of the <b>essential</b> <b>gene</b> would not serve a practical advantage; however, over a long, evolutionary time period, the genetic information in the duplicated copy may undergo additional and drastic mutations in which the proteins of the duplicated gene served a different role than those of the original <b>essential</b> <b>gene.</b> Over the long, evolutionary time period, the two similar genes would diverge so the proteins of each gene were unique in their functions. Hox gene clusters, ranging in various sizes, are found among several phyla.|$|E
5000|$|Generating {{data for}} the E-MAP depends upon the {{creation}} of thousands of double mutant strains; a study of 483 alleles, for example, resulted in an E-MAP with ~100,000 distinct double mutant pairs. The generation of libraries of <b>essential</b> <b>gene</b> mutants presents significant difficulties however, as these mutations have a lethal phenotype. Thus, E-MAP studies rely upon strains with intermediate expression levels of these genes. The decreased abundance by messenger RNA perturbation (DAmP) strategy is particularly common for the high-throughput generation of mutants necessary {{for this kind of}} analysis and allows for the partial disruption of essential genes without loss of viability. [...] DAmP relies upon the destabilization of mRNA transcripts by integrating an antibiotic selectable marker into the 3’UTR, downstream of the stop codon (figure 2). mRNA’s with 3’ extended transcripts are rapidly targeted for degradation and the result is a downregulation of the gene of interest while it remains under the control of its native promoter. In the case of non-essential genes, deletion strains may be used. Tagging at the deletion sites with molecular barcodes, unique 20-bp sequences, allows for the identification and study of relative fitness levels in each mutant strain.|$|E

We present here a different approach, one that relies exclusively on sequence features of a gene to estimate essentiality and offers a promising way to identify <b>essential</b> <b>genes</b> in unstudied or uncultured organisms.
