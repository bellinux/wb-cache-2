5000|$|<b>Fiber</b> <b>spinning</b> {{method is}} not {{commonly}} used to produce meat analogs due to its complexity, and it also negates {{one of the key}} advantages of meat analogs. This method of production increases the cost of production, which eliminates the advantage of creating an inexpensive meat/protein substitute. The <b>fiber</b> <b>spinning</b> techniques were adopted from the spun fiber method used to create synthetic fibers in the textile industry. In general, fibers are made through creating filaments out of the protein used as the starting material. The process begins through the dispersion of proteins into a dispersing medium such as an alkaline aqueous solution. This dispersion is then fed through a spinneret, a device used to extrude a polymer solution to form fibers, and deposited into an acidic salt solution with a pH range of 5.6 to 6.4 for coagulation. The filaments after exiting the small die of the spinneret would have a diameter of around [...]003 inches. These filaments are then stretched and elongated until the average thickness is around 20 microns.|$|E

50|$|Meat analog {{products}} are currently made by two basic processes, through either thermoplastic extrusion or <b>fiber</b> <b>spinning.</b> Thermoplastic extrusion involves {{the adaptation of}} production processes that are more commonly associated with the making of ready-to-eat cereal products. Extruders are simple in nature and {{are considered to be}} a cost effective method of accommodating large scale productions. It also provides the conditions that are crucial to the formation of the desirable fibers. The wet mix is mixed in a heated vessel at a temperature lower than the coagulation temperature of the proteins. The elevated temperature assists in lowering the viscosity of the dough and allows for a more homogenized mixing process. Special caution must be taken as to not over mix the dough as it has been known to substantially decrease the amount of fibers formed.|$|E
50|$|These {{properties}} {{are a result}} of the interplay of non-Newtonian properties (viscoelasticity, shear-thinning) with gravitational, viscous, and inertial effects in the jets. Free surface continuous jets of viscoelastic fluids are relevant in many engineering applications involving blood, paints, adhesives or foodstuff and industrial processes like <b>fiber</b> <b>spinning,</b> bottle-filling, oil drilling etc. In many of these processes, an understanding of the instabilities a jet undergoes due to changes in fluid parameters like Reynolds number or Deborah number is essential from process engineering point of view. With the advent of microfluidics, an understanding of the jetting properties of non-Newtonian fluids becomes essential from micro- to macro length scales, and from low to high Reynolds numbers7-9. Like other fluids, When considering viscoelastic flows, the velocity, pressure and stress must satisfy the mass and momentum equation, supplemented with a constitutive equation involving the velocity and stress.|$|E
50|$|Preparing {{the fiber}} was an {{extensive}} process that involved cleaning and teasing the <b>fiber,</b> <b>spinning</b> the yarn and plying it, dyeing the coloured yarns, and lastly weaving.

Using the spindle the two strands of yarn are twisted round each other into a single thread. Goat hair was always spun “s” meaning that the whorl would be turned counterclockwise in spinning.

In the recent study, Li and coworkers using elastomeric separator and almost achieved a fully stretchable supercapacitor based on buckled single-walled carbon nanotube macrofilms. The electrospun polyurethane was used and provided sound mechanical stretchability and the whole cell achieve excellent charge-discharge cycling stability. CNTs have an aligned nanotube structure and a negative surface charge. Therefore, they have similar structures to direct dyes, so the exhaustion method is applied for coating and absorbing CNTs on the fiber surface for preparing multifunctional fabric including antibacterial, electric conductive, flame retardant and electromagnetic absorbance properties.|$|E

In this process a highly viscous fluid is withdrawn from a reservoir and stretched to form a long fiber. The equations modeling <b>fiber</b> <b>spinning</b> are essentially based on cross-sectional averaging of the axisymmetric Stokes equations with free boundary. They form a coupled system consisting of a nonlinear mass transport equation and a nonlinear momentum conservation equation for dominant viscous forces in one space dimension. Our analytical approach is based on a representation result of the fiber cross-sectional area in terms of a suitably chosen Lagrangian variable. This representation shows that viscous fibers do not break in finite time and that solutions retain their smoothness.

40|$|Flow instabilities of {{wet-spun}} fibers in {{the form}} of draw resonance can result in radius fluctuations which impose limitations on either fiber quality or production rate. Also, at high winding velocities, if the fluid strength is sufficiently high, a filament can be pulled out of the die. The force balance between the integrated normal stress that occurs during flow in the upstream region and the spinning force determines the position of the detachment point when the filament detaches from the spinneret wall. Filament pull-out complicates the stability analysis {{in the sense that the}} upstream boundary conditions now depend on the position in the spinneret. In addition, the filament length varies in time. In this work we extend the stability analysis on <b>fiber</b> <b>spinning</b> of a single isothermal filament by including the upstream pull-out condition in a one-dimensional fiber spin model using the eXtended Pom-Pom (XPP) constitutive model. Using a spectral method, our analysis incorporates the detachment point which position is allowed to vary according to the prescribed slope of the upstream integrated normal stress. Changing the slope S for a certain DR (draw ratio) and De (Deborah) number, the growth rate for each S value can be determined. We compare the stability regions of our fiber spin model with pull-out, using different S values, to <b>fiber</b> <b>spinning</b> without pull-out. For low De values a finite value of S is destabilizing the flow whereas for higher De values there is a range of S values that stabilizes the flow.
