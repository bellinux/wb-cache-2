40|$|Differentiation of Blattella asahinai Mizukubo, Blattella vaga Hebard, and Blattella germanica (L.) was {{investigated}} using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). DNA fragments corresponding to mitochondrial CO 1,CO 1 /TL 2 (small and large fragments), and ITS 2 regions were amplified using PCR. The universal primers used for amplifying mitochondrial CO 1 and CO 1 /TL 2 (small and large fragments) were CO 1 -J- 1718 /CO 1 - N- 2191, CO 1 -J- 2441 /TL 2 -N- 3014, and CO 1 -J- 1751 /TL 2 -N- 3014. Amplification was observed with all primer combinations, but diagnostic patterns were found only with AluI digested amplicons of CO 1 and CO 1 /TL 2 (large fragments) regions. Both inter/intraspecific polymorphism was observed for the 517 bp CO 1 region between German (A, B) and Asian (A, B, C) cockroach populations. Polymorphic form B of the Asian cockroach (374 and 179 bp fragments) was {{nearly identical to}} the <b>field</b> <b>cockroach</b> (370 and 178 bp fragments). The CO 1 amplicon (517 bp) differentiated German and field cockroaches but not Asian and field cockroaches. The CO 1 /TL 2 amplicons (1275 bp) digested with AluI clearly differentiated all three species. The Asian cockroach had a distinct 540 bp fragment, whereas the <b>field</b> <b>cockroach</b> had a 403 bp fragment and the German cockroach lacked both fragments. Intraspecific polymorphs for CO 1 /TL 2 amplicons (1275 bp) were observed with the German cockroach only. Portions of the CO 1 and TL 2 genes were sequenced, revealing 76 % identity among German, Asian, and field cockroaches. Sequence data also revealed that German and Asian cockroaches were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the <b>field</b> <b>cockroach...</b>|$|E
40|$|Static {{electric}} {{fields are}} {{found throughout the}} environment and there is growing interest in how electric fields influence insect behaviour. Here we have analysed the locomotory behaviour of cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) in response to static electric fields at levels equal to and above {{those found in the}} natural environment. Walking behaviour (including velocity, distance moved,turn angle and time spent walking) were analysed as cockroaches approached an electric field boundary in an open arena, and also when continuously exposed to an electric field. On approaching an electric field boundary, the greater the electric field strength the more likely a cockroach would be to turn away from, or be repulsed by, the electric <b>field.</b> <b>Cockroaches</b> completely exposed to electric fields showed significant changes in locomotion by covering less distance, walking slowly and turning more often. This study highlights the importance of electric fields on the normal locomotory behaviour of insects...|$|R

As {{a member of}} the <b>Cockroaches,</b> <b>Field</b> was recorded on their four studio albums, The Cockroaches (1987), Fingertips (1988), Positive (1991) and St. Patrick's Day 10am (1994), before they disbanded in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{twenty years}} after the last {{recording}} of The <b>Cockroaches,</b> <b>Field</b> and his brother John recorded an album, entitled 1964 because its cover featured {{a picture of the}} brothers taken that year. [...] Their sister Maria co-wrote a track on the album, and some Cockroaches songs were re-recorded as country songs, including their hits [...] "Some Kind of Girl", [...] "Rely on Me", and [...] "Permanently Single". The album was dedicated to the Fields' parents and to Paul's oldest daughter, and reflected the previous 20 years of their lives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The antennal {{grooming}} {{behavior in}} Blartellrr germanica (L.), involves the coordinated {{use of the}} foreleg tibia and tarsus, and the mouthparts. The foreleg opposite the antenna is used to bend the flagellum to the mouthparts, after which it is pulled through the labium and maxillum by the resilience of the bend in the flagellum. Antennal grooming behavior is a sequence of five distinct events which define a grooming episode. Under normal conditions each antenna is groomed in 3 - 6 sec, and both antennae {{may or may not}} be groomed in successive episodes. When exposed to unfamiliar environments laboratory (VPI) and <b>field</b> (RHA) strain <b>cockroaches</b> display a distinct sequence of movement and antennal grooming rates (groomingslmin) during the initial 5 min. Antennal grooming in both strains increases from the resting rate (0. 23 = VPl, 0. 95 = RHA) to the investigative rate (1. 10 and 1. 80 grooming per min, respectively) after 3 min exposure, but shortly returns to the resting rate. Response to a chemical and nonchemical stimulus rapidly increases the antennal grooming from the resting rate to the irritation rate, at which time the antennae collapse to the substrate...|$|R
40|$|The German {{cockroach}} is {{an important}} household insect pest worldwide and acts as a mechanical vector and reservoir for pathogenic agents. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the basic laboratory toxicity of Blattella germanica to spinosad. The M, T, A 22, AZAR 4, BOOSTAN 7 and ABAN 21 strains were collected from field populations of six infested kitchen student dormitories and the SAMAN strain was collected from a residential area after insecticide spraying control failure in Tehran, Iran. Technical grade spinosad was delivered in 0. 5 L acetone to the first abdominal sternum of briefly CO 2 -anesthetize adult male cockroaches by topical application bioassay. Treated males monitored for mortality. Mortality data from the replicates was assessed by probit analysis. The average LD 50 of susceptible strain was 494. 3, 148. 8 and 55. 1 ng per insect after 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The LD 50 of spinosad decreased with time in the field population strains. All German cockroach strains showed a similar susceptibility or lower tolerance (1. 6 -folds) for spinosad compared with the susceptible laboratory strain and the steep slopes of dose-response curves indicated that the field population of these German cockroach strains was homogenous in response to spinosad. These results indicated that the spinosad was relatively slow-acting in topical application bioassay, with LD 50 values decreasing until 72 h and becoming stable thereafter. The effectiveness of spinosad against susceptible and the <b>field</b> population German <b>cockroach</b> strains in laboratory condition showed that spinosad probably could be useful for the control of the German cockroach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] German {{cockroach}} (Blattelh germmica) {{control treatment}} history {{has rarely been}} accompanied by resistance monitoring in the <b>field.</b> Consequently, while <b>cockroach</b> "resistance", receives much publicity, {{it is a fact}} that, to date, only a handful of complaints that are due to pyrethroid resistance, have been received. As a result, few sites have been studied for long since any form of management was initiated, so the virtues of theoretically sound resistance management strategies remain unproven, in practice. Where resistance is suspected, or reported, {{the first step is to}} confirm the diagnosis. A series of questionnaires and flow charts have been prepared to address the possibility of operational factors, such as poor application, being responsible for control failure. Test kits are then used to quantify the resistance. If confirmed as product failure, the best "fire-fighting " advice is to switch to an alternative class of active ingredient (AI). Monitoring any changes in the susceptibility profile of B. germanica, in the field, is an essential component of any resistance management strategy. Test kits can provide a measure of phenotypic, physiological tolerance, however the mechanisms that underly resistance, and the possible influence of cockroach behaviour upon the likelihood, frequency and duration of contact with control agents are also extremely important, although they may be more difficult to quantify. At present, the jury has insufficient data to decide in favour of either rotation or mixture, the two most popular approaches to resistance management, as the "best strategy " for cockroach control. Instead, the Pest control operator (PCO) is best served by having a range of modes of action (chemical, physical and biological) and presentations (eg. residuals, baits) of control agents at his disposal. The key to success lies in implementing preemptive management strategies, instead of waiting until control failure occurs. It is necessary to provide the customer with the combination of a varied range of products with technical assistance and advice for their use. This advice extends to non-chemical measures such as general hygiene and the use of monitoring traps to help target treatments in space and time...|$|R
