40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{that use of}} personal electric appliances {{may be associated with}} increased risk of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in adults was tested using interview data from a previously completed case-control study of 114 cases and 133 controls conducted between 1981 and 1984. Cases were obtained from a population-based cancer registry in western Washington state, and controls were obtained from the same area by random digit dialing. Of 32 electrical home appliances for which data on use were available for adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cases and controls, three motor-driven personal appliances (<b>electric</b> razors, <b>hair</b> <b>dryers,</b> and massage units) were selected a priori because their use represents exposure to higher peak magnetic fields than that from most other home appliances. When compared on an "ever used" versus "never used " basis, use of {{one or more of these}} appliances was not associated with increased risk of leukemia in the population studied (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 71, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 41 - 1. 24). When the appliances were considered individually, massage units were more likely to have been used by cases than by controls (OR = 3. 00, 95 % Cl 1. 43 - 6. 32), while <b>hair</b> <b>dryers</b> were more likely to have been used b...|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, Justin O. Schmidt, a {{researcher}} from Arizona, developed a hymenopteran sting pain scale, {{now known as}} the Schmidt sting pain index. In this index, a 0 is given to a sting from an insect that cannot break through human skin, a 2 is given for intermediate pain, and a 4 is given for intense pain. The scale rates stings from 78 different species in 42 different genera. Spider wasps of the genus Pepsis, also known as tarantula hawks, have a sting rating of 4. The sting is described as [...] "blinding, fierce, and shockingly <b>electric.</b> A running <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> has been dropped into your bubble bath." [...] Only the sting of the Bullet Ant, Paraponera clavata, is ranked higher, with a 4+ rating.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Hair</b> <b>dryers</b> are {{commonly}} used and can cause hair damage such as roughness, dryness and loss of hair color. It {{is important to understand}} the best way to dry hair without causing damage. Objective: The study assessed changes in the ultra-structure, morphology, moisture content, and color of hair after repeated shampooing and drying with a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> at a range of temperatures. Methods: A standardized drying time was used to completely dry each hair tress, and each tress was treated a total of 30 times. Air flow was set on the <b>hair</b> <b>dryer.</b> The tresses were divided into the following five test groups: (a) no treatment, (b) drying without using a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> (room temperature, 20 o C), (c) drying with a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> for 60 seconds at a distance of 15 cm (47 o C), (d) drying with a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> for 30 seconds at a distance of 10 cm (61 o C), (e) drying with a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> for 15 seconds at a distance of 5 cm (95 o C). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and lipid TEM were performed. Water content was analyzed by a halogen moisture analyzer and hair color was measured with a spectrophotometer. Results: Hair surfaces tended to become more damaged as the temperature increased. No cortex damage was ever noted, suggesting that the surface of hair might play a role as a barrier to prevent cortex damage. Cell membrane comple...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network {{has been}} widely applied in broad fields in line with current {{emerging}} trends, such as automatic control, automated meter reading, power management, etc. Having this system in place provides convenience, increases efficiency and result in well-managed system. The aim of this project {{is to develop a}} smart power management system using wireless sensor network. The system is developed by using an unlicensed radio frequency (RF) band where communication takes place between the main controller unit and sensor nodes on the basis of current consumption at every node. Each sensor node will sense current consumption of a dedicated device assigned to it. Data acquisition from the main controller is flexible to operate in round robin or interrupt service routine (ISR) manner. Power consumed by each device which is proportionate to the value measured by the sensor node will be calculated at the main controller and stored in a database within the main controller itself. As many sensor nodes can be placed as possible within the distance range of the main controller (40 meters indoor and 120 meters outdoor line-of-sight). Throughout this project, hardware and software development were done concurrently in order to optimize the time consumption. Validation and verification process includes calibration of current sensor used and experimenting current measurement of several electrical appliances, such as 240 V – 12 V transformer, <b>electric</b> kettle and <b>hair</b> <b>dryer.</b> Measured device activity can be controlled by placing an electromechanical switch to switch the power ON or OFF...|$|R

50|$|Around 1915, <b>hair</b> <b>dryers</b> {{began to}} go on the market in {{handheld}} form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand, and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately 2 lb, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of overheating and electrocution. <b>Hair</b> <b>dryers</b> were only capable of using 100 watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry <b>hair</b> (the average <b>dryer</b> today can use up to 2000 watts of heat).|$|R
