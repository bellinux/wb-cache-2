500|$|During {{his time}} in Congress, Gore was {{considered}} a [...] "moderate" [...] (he once referred to himself as a [...] "raging moderate") opposing federal funding of abortion, voting {{in favor of a}} bill which supported a moment in silence in schools, and voting against a ban on interstate sales of guns. In 1981, Gore was quoted as saying with regard to homosexuality, [...] "I think it is wrong", and [...] "I don't pretend to understand it, but it is not just another normal optional life style." [...] In his 1984 Senate race, <b>Gore</b> <b>said</b> when discussing homosexuality, [...] "I do not believe it is simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm." [...] He also said that he would not take campaign funds from gay rights groups. Although he maintained a position against homosexuality and gay marriage in the 1980s, <b>Gore</b> <b>said</b> in 2008 that he thinks [...] "gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women...to join together in marriage." [...] His position as a moderate (and on policies related to that label) shifted later in life after he became Vice President and ran for president in 2000.|$|E

He had earlier {{admitted}} that [...] "it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets {{across the world}} {{is one of the}} issues connected to this global crisis – {{not only because of the}} [...] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process" [...] and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, <b>Gore</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it was like. ... I felt better, so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some Republicans criticized Al Gore for organising {{the event}} and said he did so to promote himself for a 2008 U.S. Presidential {{election}} bid, although <b>Gore</b> has <b>said</b> repeatedly he is [...] "not planning to be a candidate again for office"and {{has said that he}} [...] "had fallen out of love with politics."Gore did not declare himself as a candidate for any of the 2008 presidential primaries.|$|R

500|$|In contrast, groups {{opposed to}} {{abortion}} saw [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] as a positive, pro-life song. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, {{the president of}} the California chapter of Feminists for Life (FFL) in the US, said that [...] "abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative." [...] Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single [...] "Dress You Up", and had led a campaign against explicit content in music, commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, <b>Gore</b> <b>said</b> [...] "the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E
500|$|Members of {{opposition}} parties {{have criticized the}} government's abandonment of the Kyoto goals, while David Suzuki described the proposal as a [...] "sham" [...] with [...] "weak targets". Former US vice president Al <b>Gore</b> <b>said</b> Baird's plan was a [...] "complete and total fraud" [...] that was [...] "designed to mislead the Canadian people". Baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing Gore's environmental record, noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during Gore's tenure in office and that the Kyoto Treaty was never submitted to the US Senate for ratification. Liberal Party MP Pablo Rodriguez introduced to the House of Commons a private {{bill that would have}} forced Canada to comply with the Kyoto Treaty in response to the government's plan. While the bill passed, Baird mentioned that, even though that the government wouldn't dismiss the idea, there were no new environmental measures planned. All three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the government's Throne Speech in the 2007 fall session.|$|E
500|$|Gore was [...] "dispirited" [...] {{after his}} return from Vietnam. NashvillePost.com noted that, [...] "his father's defeat made service in a {{conflict}} he deeply opposed even more abhorrent to Gore. His experiences in the war zone don't {{seem to have been}} deeply traumatic in themselves; although the engineers were sometimes fired upon, <b>Gore</b> has <b>said</b> he didn't see full-scale combat. Still, he felt that his participation in the war was wrong." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gore Vidal {{stated that}} his {{grandfather}} was an atheist {{and had a}} strong misanthropic streak: [...] "He was a genuine populist; {{but he did not}} like people very much.

500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, <b>Gore</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E
