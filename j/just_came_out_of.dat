500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} the film was decided late in the script's development. O'Bannon had quickly dropped the film's {{original}} title, Star Beast, but {{could not think of}} a name to replace it. [...] "I was running through titles, and they all stank", O'Bannon said in an interview, [...] "when suddenly, that word alien <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the typewriter at me. Alien. It's a noun and it's an adjective." [...] The word alien subsequently became the {{title of the}} film and, by extension, the name of the creature itself.|$|E

2500|$|Luhrmann was {{impressed}} with the verse-speaking of his Romeo, Leonardo DiCaprio, saying [...] "the words <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his mouth as if it was the most natural language possible". Others were less kind: Daniel Rosenthal comments that [...] "DiCaprio's throwaway, sometimes inaudible delivery is, for those not inclined to swoon uncritically at his beauty, the movie's weakest link." [...] Juliet, the sixteen-year-old Claire Danes, was praised for portraying a poise and wisdom beyond her years, and as the first screen Juliet whose speech sounded spontaneous. Miriam Margolyes played the nurse for laughs as a plump Hispanic, forever crying [...] "Hooliet! Hooliet!" [...] Pete Postlethwaite, with his Celtic Cross tattoo, captures the [...] "charming ambiguity" [...] of the Friar. Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora play the Capulets as a boozy gangland patriarch and a miserable southern belle, unhappily married and frequently abusive to each other.|$|E
2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days when I write a little poem in a little book, or make a little voice memo in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E

50|$|Another actor that {{returned}} to television was Arturo Puig, who starred the success Grande, pá! in the 1990s.

50|$|DJ (Mike Lobel)He <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> film school, {{but he is}} {{not that}} smart. He's very eager to please but {{sometimes}} forgets to do his job and film the show.

For some reason, he always talks like a slacker (also known as dude slang).|$|E
5000|$|He briefly {{attended}} Vanderbilt University, but {{dropped out}} in 1971 {{to pursue his}} passions for writing, recording and performing music. “A {{lot of it was}} uncontrollable—compelled without compulsion. I didn’t seek out to do this. It <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me,” Moore explained years later. “I had this music inside of me and I wanted to be a pop star.
