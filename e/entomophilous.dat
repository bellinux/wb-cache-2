5|$|Modern insect-pollinated (<b>entomophilous)</b> {{flowers are}} conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure {{pollination}} {{and in return}} to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted. The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964, to describe the evolutionary interactions of plants and butterflies.|$|E
25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. <b>Entomophilous</b> plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of <b>entomophilous</b> plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of anemophilous (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, <b>entomophilous</b> plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|E
25|$|Anemophilous spring {{blooming}} {{plants such}} as oak, birch, hickory, pecan, and early summer grasses may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are <b>entomophilous</b> and do not cause pollen allergies.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{people often}} mistakenly blame the {{conspicuous}} goldenrod flower for allergies.

Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by ragweed, a widespread anemophilous plant.|$|E
25|$|The flowers {{often have}} five {{generally}} fused sepals and five free petals. They are generally hermaphrodite, {{and have a}} short hypanthium, usually cup shaped. There are normally ten stamens and one elongated superior ovary, with a curved style. They are usually arranged in indeterminate inflorescences. Fabaceae are typically <b>entomophilous</b> plants (i.e. they are pollinated by insects), and the flowers are usually showy to attract pollinators.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. <b>Entomophilous</b> (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{pollination}} is {{the reproductive}} strategy {{adopted by the}} grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants. Other flowering plants are mostly pollinated by insects (or birds or bats), {{which seems to be}} the primitive state, and some plants have secondarily developed wind pollination. Some plants that are wind pollinated have vestigial nectaries, and other plants like common heather that are regularly pollinated by insects, produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable. The hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it. In general, showy, colourful, fragrant flowers like sunflowers, orchids and Buddleja are insect pollinated. The only <b>entomophilous</b> plants that are not seed plants are the dung-mosses of the family Splachnaceae.|$|E
500|$|Ornithophilous flowers {{need to be}} {{conspicuous}} to birds. Birds {{have their}} greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum, so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may {{also be able to}} see ultraviolet [...] "colors". The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor <b>entomophilous</b> (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers. Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the Phaethornithinae (hermits) and the Trochilinae, has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species.|$|E

P. media illustrates transitions in point of structure, as the filaments are pink, the anthers motionless, and the pollen grains aggregated, and it is regularly visited by Bombus terrestris. On the other hand, the slender filaments, versatile anthers, powdery pollen, and elongated protogynous style are features of other species indicating anemophily; while the presence of a degraded corolla shows its ancestors to have been <b>entomophilous.</b> P. media, therefore, illustrates, not a primitive <b>entomophilous</b> condition, but a return to it; just as is the case with Sanguisorba officinalis and Salix Caprea; but these show no capacity of restoring the corolla, the attractive features having to be borne by the calyx, which is purplish in Sanguisorba, by the pink filaments of Plantago, and by the yellow anthers in the Sallow willow" [...] (p. 271).|$|E

60|$|The {{nature and}} {{relations}} of plants which are fertilised {{by the wind}} have been admirably discussed by Delpino and Hermann Muller; and I have already made some remarks {{on the structure of}} their flowers in contrast with those of <b>entomophilous</b> species. (10/42. Delpino 'Ult. Osservazioni sulla Dicogamia' part 2 fasc. 1 1870 and 'Studi sopra un Lignaggio anemofilo' etc. 1871. Hermann Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 412, 442. Both these authors remark that plants must have been anemophilous before they were <b>entomophilous.</b> Hermann Muller further discusses in a very interesting manner the steps by which <b>entomophilous</b> flowers became nectariferous and gradually acquired their present structure through successive beneficial changes.) There is good {{reason to believe that the}} first plants which appeared on this earth were cryptogamic; and judging from what now occurs, the male fertilising element must either have possessed the power of spontaneous movement through the water or over damp surfaces, or have been carried by currents of water to the female organs. That some of the most ancient plants, such as ferns, possessed true sexual organs there can hardly be a doubt; and this shows, as Hildebrand remarks, at how early a period the sexes were separated. (10/43. 'Die Geschlechter-Vertheilung' 1867 pages 84-90.) As soon as plants became phanerogamic and grew on the dry ground, if they were ever to intercross, it would be indispensable that the male fertilising element should be transported by some means through the air; and the wind is the simplest means of transport. There must also have been a period when winged insects did not exist, and plants would not then have been rendered <b>entomophilous.</b> Even at a somewhat later period the more specialised orders of the Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, which are now chiefly concerned with the transport of pollen, did not exist. Therefore the earliest terrestrial plants known to us, namely, the Coniferae and Cycadiae, no doubt were anemophilous, like the existing species of these same groups. A vestige of this early state of things is likewise shown by some other groups of plants which are anemophilous, as these on the whole stand lower in the scale than <b>entomophilous</b> species.|$|E
6000|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{quantity and}} lightness of the pollen of anemophilous plants {{are no doubt}} both necessary, as their pollen has generally to be carried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers; for, as we shall soon see, most anemophilous plants have their sexes separated. The fertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being of large size or plumose; {{and in the case}} of the Coniferae, by the naked ovules secreting a drop of fluid, as shown by Delpino. Although the number of anemophilous species is small, as the author just quoted remarks, the number of individuals is large in comparison with that of <b>entomophilous</b> species. This holds good especially in cold and temperate regions, where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate, and where consequently <b>entomophilous</b> plants are less favourably situated. We see this in our forests of Coniferae and other trees, such as oaks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc.; and in the Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, which clothe our meadows and swamps; all these trees and plants being fertilised by the wind. As a large quantity of pollen is wasted by anemophilous plants, it is surprising that so many vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals should still exist in any part of the world; for if they had been rendered <b>entomophilous,</b> their pollen would have been transported by the aid of the senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safety than by the wind. That such a conversion is possible can hardly be doubted, from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediate forms; and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows, as we may infer from the nature of their nearest allies.

6000|$|If my {{arguments}} {{on this point}} are sound, they will dispose also of Mr. Grant Allen's view of the direct action of the colour sense on the animal integuments.[161] He argues that the colours of insects and birds reproduce generally the colours of the flowers they frequent or the fruits they eat, and he adduces numerous cases in which flower-haunting insects and fruit-eating birds are gaily coloured. This he supposes {{to be due to}} the colour-taste, developed by the constant presence of bright flowers and fruits, being applied to the selection of each variation towards brilliancy in their mates; thus in time producing the gorgeous and varied hues they now possess. Mr. Allen maintains that [...] "insects are bright where bright flowers exist in numbers, and dull where flowers are rare or inconspicuous;" [...] and he urges that [...] "we can hardly explain this wide coincidence otherwise than by supposing that a taste for colour is produced through the constant search for food among <b>entomophilous</b> blossoms, and that this taste has reacted upon its possessors through the action of unconscious sexual selection." ...|$|E
6000|$|There is {{no great}} {{difficulty}} in understanding how an anemophilous plant {{might have been}} rendered <b>entomophilous.</b> Pollen is a nutritious substance, and would soon have been discovered and devoured by insects; and if any adhered to their bodies {{it would have been}} carried from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower, or from one flower to another. One of the chief characteristics of the pollen of anemophilous plants is its incoherence; but pollen in this state can adhere to the hairy bodies of insects, as we see with some Leguminosae, Ericaceae, and Melastomaceae. We have, however, better evidence of the possibility of a transition of the above kind in certain plants being now fertilised partly by the wind and partly by insects. The common rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) is so far in an intermediate condition, that I have seen many Diptera sucking the flowers, with much pollen adhering to their bodies; and yet the pollen is so incoherent, that clouds of it are emitted if the plant be gently shaken on a sunny day, some of which could hardly fail to fall on the large stigmas of the neighbouring flowers. According to Delpino and Hermann Muller, some species of Plantago are in a similar intermediate condition. (10/44. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) ...|$|E
60|$|Dioecious plants, however fertilised, {{have a great}} {{advantage}} over other plants in their cross-fertilisation being assured. But this advantage is gained {{in the case of}} anemophilous species {{at the expense of the}} production of an enormous superfluity of pollen, with some risk to them and to <b>entomophilous</b> species of their fertilisation occasionally failing. Half the individuals, moreover, namely, the males, produce no seed, and this might possibly be a disadvantage. Delpino remarks that dioecious plants cannot spread so easily as monoecious and hermaphrodite species, for a single individual which happened to reach some new site could not propagate its kind; but it may be doubted whether this is a serious evil. Monoecious plants can hardly fail to be to a large extent dioecious in function, owing to the lightness of their pollen and to the wind blowing laterally, with the great additional advantage of occasionally or often producing some self-fertilised seeds. When they are also dichogamous, they are necessarily dioecious in function. Lastly, hermaphrodite plants can generally produce at least some self-fertilised seeds, and they are at the same time capable, through the various means specified in this chapter, of cross-fertilisation. When their structure absolutely prevents self-fertilisation, they are in the same relative position to one another as monoecious and dioecious plants, with what may be an advantage, namely, that every flower is capable of yielding seeds.|$|E
60|$|Finally, we {{have seen}} {{reason to believe that}} the higher plants are descended from {{extremely}} low forms which conjugated, and that the conjugating individuals differed somewhat from one another,--the one representing the male and the other the female--so that plants were aboriginally dioecious. At a very early period such lowly organised dioecious plants probably gave rise by budding to monoecious plants with the two sexes borne by the same individual; and by a still closer union of the sexes to hermaphrodite plants, which are now much the commonest form. (10/63. There is a considerable amount of evidence that all the higher animals are the descendants of hermaphrodites; and it is a curious problem whether such hermaphroditism may not have been the result of the conjugation of two slightly different individuals, which represented the two incipient sexes. On this view, the higher animals may now owe their bilateral structure, with all their organs double at an early embryonic period, to the fusion or conjugation of two primordial individuals.) As soon as plants became affixed to the ground, their pollen must have been carried by some means from flower to flower, at first almost certainly by the wind, then by pollen-devouring, and afterwards by nectar-seeking insects. During subsequent ages some few <b>entomophilous</b> plants have been again rendered anemophilous, and some hermaphrodite plants have had their sexes again separated; and we can vaguely see the advantages of such recurrent changes under certain conditions.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems at}} first sight a still more {{surprising}} fact that plants, after having been once rendered <b>entomophilous,</b> should ever again have become anemophilous; but this has occasionally though rarely occurred, for instance, with the common Poterium sanguisorba, as may be inferred from its belonging to the Rosaceae. Such cases are, however, intelligible, as almost all plants require to be occasionally intercrossed; and if any entomiphilous species ceased to be visited by insects, it would probably perish unless it were rendered anemophilous. A plant would be neglected by insects if nectar failed to be secreted, unless indeed a large supply of attractive pollen was present; and from {{what we have seen}} of the excretion of saccharine fluid from leaves and glands being largely governed in several cases by climatic influences, and from some few flowers which do not now secrete nectar still retaining coloured guiding-marks, the failure of the secretion cannot be considered as a very improbable event. The same result would follow to a certainty, if winged insects ceased to exist in any district, or became very rare. Now there is only a single plant in the great order of the Cruciferae, namely, Pringlea, which is anemophilous, and this plant is an inhabitant of Kerguelen Land, where there are hardly any winged insects, owing probably, as was suggested by me in the case of Madeira, to the risk which they run of being blown out to sea and destroyed. (10/56. The Reverend A.E. Eaton in 'Proceedings of the Royal Society' volume 23 1875 page 351.) ...|$|E
60|$|Delpino {{states that}} this plant {{presents}} in Italy three forms, which graduate from an anemophilous into an <b>entomophilous</b> condition. According to H. Muller, {{there are only}} two forms in Germany, neither of which show any special adaptation for insect fertilisation, and both appear to be hermaphrodites. (7/19. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) But I have found in two localities in England female and hermaphrodite forms existing together; and the same fact has been noticed by others. (7/20. Mr. C.W. Crocker 'The Gardener's Chronicle' 1864 page 294. Mr. W. Marshall writes to me to the same effect from Ely.) The females are less frequent than the hermaphrodites; their stamens are short, and their anthers, which are of a brighter green whilst young than those of the other form, dehisce properly, yet contain either no pollen, or a small amount of imperfect grains of variable size. All the flower-heads on a plant belong to the same form. It is well known that this species is strongly proterogynous, and I found that the protruding stigmas of both the hermaphrodite and female flowers were penetrated by pollen-tubes, whilst their own anthers were immature and had not escaped out of the bud. Plantago media does not present two forms; but it appears from Asa Gray's description, that such is the case with four of the North American species. (7/21. 'Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States' 2nd edition 1856 page 269. See also 'American Journal of Science' November 1862 page 419 and 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Science' October 14, 1862 page 53.) The corolla does not properly expand in the short- stamened form of these plants.|$|E
60|$|As two {{objects in}} most respects opposed, namely, {{cross-fertilisation}} and self-fertilisation, have {{in many cases}} to be gained, we can understand the co-existence in so many flowers of structures which appear at first sight unnecessarily complex and of an opposed nature. We can thus understand the great contrast in structure between cleistogene flowers, which are adapted exclusively for self-fertilisation, and ordinary flowers on the same plant, which are adapted so as to allow of at least occasional cross-fertilisation. (10/21. Fritz Muller has discovered in the animal kingdom 'Jenaische Zeitschr.' B. 4 page 451, a case curiously analogous {{to that of the}} plants which bear cleistogene and perfect flowers. He finds in the nests of termites in Brazil, males and females with imperfect wings, which do not leave the nests and propagate the species in a cleistogene manner, but only if a fully-developed queen after swarming does not enter the old nest. The fully-developed males and females are winged, and individuals from distinct nests can hardly fail often to intercross. In the act of swarming they are destroyed in almost infinite numbers by a host of enemies, so that a queen may often fail to enter an old nest; and then the imperfectly developed males and females propagate and keep up the stock.) The former are always minute, completely closed, with their petals more or less rudimentary and never brightly coloured; they never secrete nectar, never are odoriferous, have very small anthers which produce only a few grains of pollen, and their stigmas are but little developed. Bearing in mind that some flowers are cross-fertilised by the wind (called anemophilous by Delpino), and others by insects (called <b>entomophilous),</b> we can further understand, as was pointed out by me several years ago, the great contrast in appearance between these two classes of flowers. (10/22. 'Journal of the Linnean Society' volume 7 Botany 1863 page 77.) Anemophilous flowers resemble in many respects cleistogene flowers, but differ widely in not being closed, in producing an extraordinary amount of pollen which is always incoherent, and in the stigma often being largely developed or plumose. We certainly owe the beauty and odour of our flowers and the storage of a large supply of honey to the existence of insects.|$|E
