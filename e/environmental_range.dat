25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{rational}} state actors would never use biological weapons offensively. The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like smallpox or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, anthrax can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment. Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow <b>environmental</b> <b>range,</b> the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce data center cooling energy, ASHRAE Technical Committee 9. 9 {{expanded}} thermal <b>environmental</b> <b>ranges</b> for data centers and recommended using the economizer, and it has reduced data center cooling energy successfully. The main purpose {{of this research is}} to establish an energy optimization process for the air-side economizer in a modular data center with respect to various parameters (supply air conditions, server thermal characteristics, cooling system configurations, and heat exchange effectiveness), and to determine optimum supply air ranges through simulation. The cooling energy simulation is conducted for three types of air-side economizers by changing the supply air temperature (SAT) and heat exchanger effectiveness at 16 locations in South Korea based on the three thermal <b>environmental</b> <b>ranges.</b> The simulation result shows that the lowest cooling energy consumption appears when the computer room air handler (CRAH) SAT is within 18 - 23 degrees C, and at higher SAT conditions, the cooling energy consumption increases, since chiller energy reduction is offset by the increase in CRAH fan energy.

40|$|The path {{of species}} {{diversification}} is commonly observed by inspecting the fossil record. Yet, how species diversity changes at geological timescales relate to lower-level processes remains poorly understood. Here we use mathematical models of spatially structured populations {{to show that}} natural selection and gradual environmental change give rise to discontinuous phenotype changes that can be connected to speciation and extinction at the macroevolutionary level. In our model, new phenotypes arise {{in the middle of}} the environmental gradient, while newly appearing environments are filled by existing phenotypes shifting their adaptive optima. Slow environmental change leads to loss of phenotypes {{in the middle of the}} extant <b>environmental</b> <b>range,</b> whereas fast change causes extinction at one extreme of the <b>environmental</b> <b>range.</b> We compared our model predictions against a well-known yet partially unexplained pattern of intense hoofed mammal diversification associated with grassland expansion during the Late Miocene. We additionally used the model outcomes to cast new insight into Cope’s law of the unspecialized. Our general finding is that the rate of environmental change determines where generation and loss of diversity occur in the phenotypic and physical spaces. © 2015 by The University of Chicago...|$|E
40|$|Ecologists {{have long}} speculated that species with wider <b>environmental</b> <b>ranges</b> would have broader ranges in phe notype; however, most tests of this {{hypothesis}} have involved {{small numbers of}} species and/or closely related taxa. We related phenotypic variation in twelve salt marsh plant species from six families to variation in four environmental variables using multiple regression. Within species, plant phenotype was predictably related to environmental variation. Salinity {{was the most common}} predictor of plant traits, followed by organic content, water content and elevation. Across species, regressions of single plant trait CVs on range (2 x SD) of single environmental variables were not significant and did not support the hypothesis that species occupying broad <b>environmental</b> <b>ranges</b> would have broad ranges in phenotypes. However, regression of a composite phenotypic PCA 1 on a composite environmental PCA 1 showed a marginally significant (P = 0. 054) linear relationship for 10 species. Considering the different patterns of response across species, the lack of a relationship between vari ation in single phenotypic traits and single environmental variables is likely because the distantly-related taxa employed fundamentally different morphological and physiological strategies to respond to environmental stress gradients. The significant relationship between composite environmental and phenotypic variables reflects the complex nature of species phenotypic response to multivariate environmental gradients. Specifically, in this sys tem, species increase variation in the number of leaves, but decrease variation in leaf size in response to an increase in range of salinity and decrease in range of water and organic content...|$|R

40|$|Polylepis is a genus {{restricted}} to the Andean Mountain Range, naturally occurring above the upper continuous forest limit. The purpose of this work was to integrate and compare functional characteristics in terms of water and carbon relations and low temperature resistance mechanisms in different Polylepis species along a latitudinal gradient. The studied species were P. sericea in Venezuela, P. tarapacana in Bolivia and P. australis in Argentina. Seasonal measurements of leaf water and osmotic potentials, stomatal conductance, CO 2 assimilation and respiration rates, and injury and freezing temperatures were compared. There is a gradient, in terms of functional attributes, along the <b>environmental</b> <b>range.</b> P. tarapacana is the most tolerant species to water stress, while P. sericea avoids the less harsh conditions of its habitat through osmotic adjustments and cell wall elasticity changes. Mean CO 2 assimilation rates were higher in P. australis (9 μmol·m‑ 2 ·s‑ 1) campared to P. sericea (5 μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1) and P. tarapacana (3 ·μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1). Mean night leaf respiration rates were similar for all species (1 - 2 ·μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1). In terms of low temperature resistance, P. sericea shows daily osmotic adjustments and a moderate supercooling capacity (- 9 ºC). The other two species rely on freezing tolerance {{in order to survive}} the more extreme low temperature conditions.
