5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other <b>domestic</b> <b>activities</b> may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Though Henry IV gave Thomas Percy {{influence}} in south Wales, {{relations between the}} two deteriorated due partly to delays in payment. Thomas’ nephew, Henry Percy, rose in armed rebellion in July 1403 and Thomas joined him. The rebellion culminated in the battle of Shrewsbury in which Thomas Percy was captured. Two days later, on 23 July, he was beheaded and his property– including Wressle Castle– was subsequently confiscated by the crown. Between 1403 and 1471 ownership of the castle swapped between the crown and those the reigning monarch chose to grant it to, though only for short periods. In 1471, Wressle Castle was given to Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, returning it to the Percy family. His son, Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, undertook an extensive programme of refurbishment at Wressle Castle, refurbishing the interior and updating the gardens. At the time {{he was one of the}} richest men in England. The Northumberland Household Book was compiled around this time and details day-to-day <b>domestic</b> <b>activities</b> at the castles of Wressle and Leconfield, and is used by historians to study the late medieval household.|$|E

500|$|An {{expansion}} of the terminal was approved in 1989 and completed in 1991 when a second pier was added by Ansett to the south for use by smaller regional airline Kendell.

It {{was intended to be}} used by the [...] "New" [...] Ansett, under ownership of Tesna; however, following the Tesna group's withdrawal of the purchase of Ansett in 2002, the terminal was sold back to Melbourne Airport by Ansett's administrators. As a result, Melbourne Airport undertook a major renovation and facelift of the terminal, following which Virgin Australia (then Virgin Blue) moved in from what was then called Domestic Express (now Terminal 4), and has since begun operating The Lounge in the terminal, using the former Ansett Australia Golden Wing Lounge area.

500|$|The new {{state-owned}} banks {{took over}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>activities</b> and have been recapitalised by government with a capital ratio of 16% of all assets. The Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) has acted to [...] "ring-fence" [...] the Icelandic operations of Landsbanki and Glitnir, stating its aim of [...] "continued banking operations for Icelandic families and businesses". NBI (originally known as Nýi Landsbanki) was set up on 9 October with 200 billion krónur in equity and 2,300 billion krónur of assets. Nýi Glitnir was set up on 15 October with 110 billion krónur in equity and 1,200 billion krónur of assets. Nýja Kaupþing was set up on 22 October with 75 billion krónur in equity and 700 billion krónur of assets. The equity in all three new banks was supplied by the Icelandic government, and amounted to 30% of Iceland's GDP. The new banks {{will also have to}} reimburse their predecessors for the net value of the transferred assets, as determined by [...] "recognised appraisers".

500|$|Because of women's {{expanded}} {{roles in}} the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and <b>domestic</b> <b>activities,</b> many women today face the [...] "double burden" [...] of home and work responsibilities. Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, {{even when they are}} working full-time jobs. This breeds anger and frustration, as women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers. There have been said to be more reasons, other than gender roles, as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women. Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's. Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not. Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities. In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and {{women between the ages of}} 25-54, women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women. As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift. The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.|$|E
40|$|Starting from a {{theoretical}} model with importable, traded and nontraded goods, we identify {{a long run}} relationship among Greek imports, <b>domestic</b> <b>activity</b> and relative prices. The model supports weak exogeneity of relative prices which means that Greek importers take the price of imports as given. The greater than one income elasticity, which persists even when cyclical demand effects are netted out, means that Greece faces an external constraint on growth as verified by the negative effect of the disequilibrium error {{in the short run}} output equation. The findings of this paper suggest that the price of domestic tradeables and nontradeables are significant determinants of the long run and short run import demand, while instability in domestic inflation is found to have a strong short run depressing effect on <b>domestic</b> <b>activity.</b> ...|$|R

[...] Jones resigned his position in the Methodist church, but continued to undertake work here and there as his health permitted. [...] By 1850, his doctor had ordered him to completely stop travelling and performing his clerical duties, but Jones ignored his advice. [...] In 1851, Jones {{moved to a new}} estate near Echo Place, which he dubbed Echo Villa. [...] The estate was close to the established town of Brantford, but also allowed him to be close to New Credit. [...] Although he continued to work, his failing health kept him at home often, and he began pursuing more <b>domestic</b> <b>activities.</b> [...] Taking up woodcarving, he won £15 for his bowl and ladle at the annual provincial exhibition. [...] He began writing for the Aborigines Protection Society, acting as their Canadian correspondent for their publication The Colonial Intelligencer; or, Aborigines' Friend. In the 1850s, Peter began to devote his time and efforts more to his wife and children. [...] His son Charles attended Genesee College in Lima, New York, then studied law. [...] Jones continued travelling when his health permitted. [...] In 1851, to Lake of Two Mountains in Canada East; in 1852, through Northern Ontario; in 1853, he travelled to New York City for a missionary meeting; and in 1854, he travelled to Syracuse, New York for a Methodist convention.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sense}} used by Émile Durkheim, the Late and Terminal Archaic {{residents}} of Jiskairumoko exhibited a simple cultural pattern. [...] This {{does not imply}} the residents were simple, it indicates that components of culture (economic practices, political structures, spiritual practice) were embedded rather than strongly differentiated. [...] At Jiskairumoko, the earliest pithouse, radiocarbon dated to ca. 3200 cal BC, appears to {{have served as a}} place of ritual preparation. Evidence for this {{comes in the form of}} thermal processing of ochre for use as a mineral pigment. At Jiskairumoko, these same ochre pigments were found sprinkled at the base of graves found outside some of the other pithouses While rituals appear to have taken place within the site's oldest pithouse, regular <b>domestic</b> <b>activities</b> were also performed in this dwelling. Therefore, ritual and <b>domestic</b> <b>activities</b> were embedded spatially within the same architecture.

40|$|A dynamic {{analysis}} of the international transmission of government expenditure shocks under alternative methods of finance is presented.
