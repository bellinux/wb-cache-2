Instead, when their adaptive capacity to stress is exhausted, they reorganize in an alternative system regime once a <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold</b> has been passed (Fig.  1 b). An alternative system regime means that basic structural (e.g., species assemblages) and functional patterns and processes (e.g., production of food and fiber) are distinctly different compared to the system regime that existed prior to passing the <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold.</b> Ecologist use the term “ecological resilience,” when a system reorganizes in an alternative regime rather than bounces back after disturbances (Holling 1973).|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{nonlinear}} global stabilisation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is presented {{and used to}} eliminate transient growth in linearly stable Poiseuille flow for the case of full-field actuation and sensing. In the absence of complete velocity field sensing and full actuation the controller synthesis procedure gives a controller that minimises the the attainable perturbation energy over all disturbances and thus maximises the <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold</b> for transition to occur. The control laws are found using the theory of positive real systems, originating in the control systems community. It is found that a control law making the linearised part of the perturbed Navier-Stokes equations positive real, provides nonlinear global stability.

As expected, vertical coupons show less deposition than horizontal ones. The smallest difference between the horizontal and vertical exposures is obtained for the haze. According to the Mie theory, this parameter is essentially sensitive to the presence of fine (submicron) particles that scatter the UV and visible radiations efficiently. Because the deposition of such fine particles is driven more by diffusion than by gravitational settling [34], one does not expect them to deposit very differently on the vertical and horizontal coupons and, as a result, haze is less sensitive to the coupons orientation than the other parameters.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the physics}} of flow {{instability}} and turbulent transition in shear flows is studied by analyzing the energy variation of fluid particles under the interaction of base flow with a disturbance. It is shown {{that it is the}} transverse energy gradient that leads to the disturbance amplification while the disturbance is damped by the energy loss due to viscosity along the streamline. For the first time, a theory derived strictly from physics, is used to show that the flow instability under finite amplitude disturbance leads to turbulent transition. It is also shown that flow instability in shear flows is a nonlinear phenomenon and it has a threshold related to the disturbance amplitude. The mechanism for velocity inflection and hairpin vortex formation are explained with reference to analytical results. The inverse Reynolds number dependence of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold,</b> observed in recent experiments, is well explained. Following from this analysis, it can be demonstrated that the critical value of the so called energy gradient parameter Kmax is constant for turbulent transition in parallel flows, and this is confirmed by experiments for pipe Poiseuille flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and plane Couette flow...|$|E

40|$|To {{conserve}} tropical forests, it {{is crucial}} to characterise the <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold</b> beyond which populations of tropical trees are no longer resilient. This approach is still not widely employed, especially with respect to the effects of moderate disturbances. Compensation effects, such as positive interactions among plants, are addressed even more rarely. We attempt to identify the extents to which the distribution of the keystone palm tree Ceroxylon echinulatum is regulated by various regimes of deforestation in a threatened tropical montane cloud forest in the North-West Andes of Ecuador. The demographic structure of this palm tree was examined in three habitats: old-growth forest, forest disturbed by selective logging, and deforested pasture. Patterns were related to stand structure, microclimate, and soil composition. Seedling desiccation owing to severe aboveground water stress led to the absence of juvenile palms in pastures, and thus was predictive of a near extinction of the species in this habitat. However, shade provided by dominant bunchgrass in pastures considerably reduced above- and belowground water stress by diminishing light intensity. Selective logging resulted in a higher density of individuals in disturbed forests than in old-growth forests, but was associated with a spoiled spatial structure. Therefore, the protection of residual old-growth forests is a prerequisite for the conservation of C. echinulatum, although secondary forests might act as provisional refuges that promote its resilience. The reduction of water stress by nurse grasses in pastures represents a promising approach to promote the resilience of tropical tree species and their associated communities after deforestation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the level of}} speckle that can be tolerated in a laser cinema projector. For this purpose, we equipped a movie theatre room with a prototype laser projector. A group of 186 participants was gathered to evaluate the speckle perception of several, short movie trailers in a subjective ‘Quality of Experience’ experiment. This study is important as the introduction of lasers in projection systems has been hampered {{by the presence of}} speckle in projected images. Laser display technology is widely considered as the most promising technology for high-lumen future projection applications. These sources can combine a high lumen output with a low étendue, which leads to a high optical efficiency in the projector. Lasers also offer a long lifetime and their output power does not degrade strongly. Laser projectors can therefore potentially outperform current arc-lamp projectors in many different aspects. But the speckle pattern originating from the (partly) coherent laser beam is displeasing for a human observer and therefore it needs to be reduced to an acceptable level. We identify a speckle <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold</b> by statistically analyzing the observers’ responses for different values of the amount of speckle, which was monitored using a well-defined speckle measurement method. The analysis shows that the speckle perception of a human observer is not only dependent on the objectively measured amount of speckle, but it is also strongly influenced by the image content. We find that, for moving images, the speckle becomes disturbing if the speckle contrast becomes larger than 6. 9 % for the red, 6. 0 % for the green, and 4. 8 % for the blue primary colors of the projector, whereas for still images the speckle detection threshold is about 3 %. The speckle disturbance limit for movies thus turns out to be substantially larger than that for still images, and hence is easier to attain. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|In social-ecological systems {{disturbances}} can {{ultimately lead to}} wider systemic changes {{resulting in}} substantial reorganization of the system’s structure, function and dynamics (i.e., regime shifts). Regime shifts occur when for example a shallow lake with clear water and submerged vegetation shifts into a nutrient-enriched, turbid-water regime with frequent algal bloom outbreaks. This nutrient-enriched regime is stable, meaning that the lake will not return to a clear-water regime without substantial management. Such systemic changes of social-ecological systems can be explored through metal songs from distinct subgenres. Regime shifts per se that characterize the non-linear transitions between system regimes can be characterized with metalcore and deathcore songs. These songs symbolize the dynamism inherent in non-linear transitions {{in the form of}} “breakdowns” that introduce sudden changes in beat and rhythm patterns in a song; that is, breakdowns in metalcore and deathcore is figurative of the existence of and can inspire people about dynamic changes between alternative regimes in social-ecological systems. A further systemic aspect of social-ecological system change becomes evident when systems have shifted and locked in a new regime after a <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold</b> has been passed. Similarly to the above examples of sentiments people may experience {{in the aftermath of a}} disturbance, metal allegories based on more abrasive and harsher black metal, can be used to characterize the persistence of an undesired post-disturbance regime; for instance, when a system locks in poverty traps, which are characterized by limited access to credit and capital markets, extreme environmental degradation (which depletes agricultural production potential), corrupt governance, capital flight, poor education systems, disease ecology, lack of public health care, war and poor infrastructure (Bonds et al. 2010). To demonstrate such cases, metal can be used to increase people´s awareness that systems are often not able to rebound from disturbances, but rather become trapped in an undesirable regime for humans, and which are very difficult to escape (e.g., Cinner et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} on the Sifnos island, Greece, assesses the main factors {{controlling}} vegetation succession following crop abandonment and describes the vegetation dynamics of maquis and phrygana formations in relation to alternative theories of secondary succession. Field survey data were collected and analysed at {{community as well as}} species level. The results show that vegetation succession on abandoned crop fields is determined by the combined effects of grazing intensity, soil and geological characteristics and time. The analysis determines the quantitative grazing thresholds that modify the successional pathway. Light grazing leads to dominance by maquis vegetation while overgrazing leads to phryganic vegetation. The proposed model shows that vegetation succession following crop abandonment is a complex multi-factor process where the final or the stable stage of the process is not predefined but depends on the factors affecting succession.

40|$|Intertidal areas support {{during the}} non-breeding season many wading birds Charadrii that may often take flight in {{response}} to the presence of people or of birds of prey on their intertidal feeding and roosting grounds. Disturbance can cause birds to spend energy flying away and to lose feeding time while relocating to different feeding areas, where the increased bird densities may intensify competition from interference and, if of sufficient duration, from prey depletion. Until now, there has been no method for establishing how frequently birds can be put to flight before their fitness is reduced. We show how individual-based behavioural models can establish critical thresholds for the frequency with which wading birds can be disturbed before they die of starvation. It uses oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus in the baie de Somme, France where birds were put to flight by disturbance up to 1. 73 times/daylight hour. Modelling shows that the birds can be disturbed up to 1. 0 – 1. 5 times/h before their fitness is reduced in winters with good feeding conditions (abundant cockles Cerastoderma edule and mild weather) but only up to 0. 2 – 0. 5 times/h when feeding conditions are poor (scarce cockles and severe winter weather).

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{resilience}} is increasing in applied ecosystem research {{and has become}} a valuable concept for analyzing relationships between natural environments and various stressors, e. g., global warming or direct human impacts. This concept offers opportunities to apply management strategies to different system levels and can provide insights into future ecosystem change. Polar systems are known to be ecologically sensitive to global and local impacts. Records of changes in polar environments, used as alarm signals by governmental and non-governmental institutions, are well documented in various reports. However, it remains difficult to define specific <b>disturbance</b> <b>thresholds,</b> only few methods allow an evaluation of the actual natural state of polar systems, its degree of modification they can accommodate before trophic systems change with severe damages. Some of the main drivers of system changes have been analyzed with respect to possible effects on system changes over different time scales. This paper reviews studies of polar ecosystems and their ability to cope with changes by assessing their resilience in response to human disturbances. Furthermore, we suggest that a customized framework (drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR)) should be applied to obtain an improved understanding of the interactions between the state of, and changes in, natural systems. 生態系のレジリエンスについての理論は、応用生態系研究の分野で増えつつあり、自然環境とそれに対する様々なストレス（地球温暖化や人間活動の直接的影響など）の関係を分析するための有効な概念となった。この概念はまた、生態系変化の将来予測も可能とする。しかし、攪乱の程度に対して特定の閾値を定めることは困難であり、極域の自然環境を実際に評価できる手法はほとんどない。本論文では、極域における生態系と環境変動に対するその耐性について、人間活動による攪乱に対するレジリエンスを評価した過去の研究を取り上げ、概説する。さらに、自然環境の状態や変化に関する高度化した理解に必要な、修整されたモデル（根本的原因、負荷、状態、影響、対策(DPSIR) ）を提案する...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in community composition {{and the response}} of bacterial communities to fluctuating environmental conditions under sustained baseflows and following storms were determined for benthic bacteria colonizing the two dominant streambed habitats within the White Clay Creek. The White Clay is a temperate, 3 rd-order stream with an intact riparian deciduous forest that drains an agricultural watershed in the southeastern Pennsylvania Piedmont (USA). Bacterial colonizing rocks (epilithon) and sediments were collected from multiple riffle and runs sites, separated over a 1. 8 km reach of stream, using a nested sampling design consisting of three spatial scales: sites (separated by ≥ 50 m); groups within sites (separated by 3 ̆e 1 m but 3 ̆c 10 m); and individual cores or rocks within groups (separated by 3 ̆c 1 m). Additionally, streambed bacteria from both habitats were collected under sustained baseflow conditions during 2006 - 2007 and following storms {{during the summer and}} fall of 2005 and all four seasons during 2006 - 2007. Environmental conditions were measured at each site on each date. Distinct bacterial communities were observed between streambed habitats that correlated with stream flow velocity and stream depth. The scale of spatial variability differed between habitats with epilithic composition most variable at scales ≥ 50 m, while sediment composition varied most at scales ranging from 3 ̆e 1 m but 3 ̆c 10 m. Seasonal shifts in community composition correlated with stream temperature in both habitats, but were more pronounced for epilithic than sediment communities. Communities were altered by storm-induced increases in discharge, but began to return following a recovery period. A lower <b>disturbance</b> <b>threshold</b> was identified for sediment bacteria than epilithic bacteria. These findings contribute to observations from a broader range of environments that indicate that habitat is important in structuring bacterial communities. Habitat differences in composition, seasonality, and the response to storms suggest that habitat stability mediates the response of benthic bacteria to temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions. The development of stable communities following sufficiently long periods without storms suggests that competitive exclusion and predation pressure, which are important in structuring community assemblages of macroorganisms, also determine microbial succession. ...|$|E

We investigated {{the impacts of}} anthropogenic disturbances (i. e. clearcuts and roads) on {{the movements of the}} woodland caribou, a threatened species inhabiting the highly managed southern fringe of the boreal forest. We used GPS telemetry data from 49 females followed between 2004 and 2010 in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region (Québec, Canada). Space use was evaluated at a coarser scale using individual home-range size as a function of observed disturbance levels within home ranges. Individuals first expanded their home ranges alongside increases in disturbance levels, yet subsequently shifted their behaviour when certain <b>disturbance</b> <b>thresholds</b> were exceeded by contracting home ranges and potentially trapping individuals in sub-optimal habitats. Fine-scale movements were investigated using a use-availability design contrasting observed and random steps (i. e. straight-line segment between successive locations). Individuals, although mostly avoiding disturbances, nonetheless regularly came in close contact with them. As a consequence, females modulated their movements daily and annually, avoiding disturbances predominantly during periods of higher vulnerability (i. e. calving, early and winter) during the day, while using them in periods of higher energy requirements (i. e. spring, summer and rut) during dusk/dawn and at night. Additionally, individuals altered their behaviour depending on the context in which they were moving, either relocating or remaining in altered habitats as disturbance levels increased. Our results suggest that current disturbance levels observed in the boreal forest cause behavioural shifts that may compel females to use suboptimal habitats, likely threatening the persistence of woodland caribou populations in North-American forests...|$|R

This was prompted by a series of national audits of Australia's environmental programs that could find no evidence of public investment improving the condition of waterways, soils and native vegetation, despite major public programs investing more than 4. 2 billion in environmental repair over the last 20 years. Landscape Logic describes how this collaboration of 42 researchers and environmental managers went about the research. It describes what they found and what they learned about the challenge of attributing cause to environmental change. While public programs had been responsible for increase in vegetation extent, there was less evidence for improvement in vegetation condition and water quality. In many cases critical levels of intervention had not been reached, interventions were not sufficiently mature to have had any measurable impact, monitoring had not been designed to match the spatial and temporal scales of the interventions, and interventions lacked sufficiently clear objectives and metrics to ever be detectable.

40|$|International audienceTrees {{affected}} by mass movements record {{the evidence of}} geomorphic disturbance in their growth-ring series, and thereby provide a precise geochronological tool for the reconstruction of past process activity. At the tree scale, identification of past mass movements was typically based {{on the presence of}} growth anomalies and focused on the presence of scars, tilted or buried trunks, as well as on apex decapitation. In terms of sampling strategy, however, clear guidelines have been largely missing. Most previous work was based either on the sampling of visibly disturbed trees irrespective of their position at the study site or on the systematic sampling of trees evenly distributed along transects. Based on a dense dataset of 323 trees growing on an active landslide body, this study aims at defining guidelines for future tree-ring sampling of landslides. Using random extractions of trees and iterative mapping, we investigate subsets of the full tree-ring sample to define optimal sampling strategy, sample depth and trees for the development of frequency maps of landslide reactivations. We demonstrate that (i) the sampling of 50 - 100 trees can be sufficient to obtain satisfactory results on landslide frequency without including noise to the dendrogeomorphic record; (ii) increasing growth <b>disturbance</b> <b>thresholds</b> should be adjusted to sample size and are preferable to fixed values; (iii) an even distribution of sampled trees is crucial to increase the reliability of frequency maps, even more so if the reconstruction is based on small sample sizes; and that (iv) the selection of the most frequently disturbed trees is key to reduce uncertainties in the frequency maps. The optimization of sample sizes and the adjustment of sampling strategy will not only facilitate fieldwork and render analyses and interpretation more reliable, but will also ultimately allow reconstruction of time series of past mass movements with reasonable temporal efforts and excellent cost-benefit ratios...|$|R
40|$|Northern peatlands are the world’s most {{efficient}} terrestrial ecosystems at storing carbon. The {{effects of global}} climate change are expected to be intensified in high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere, where peatlands are a dominant landscape feature. Accordingly, there is concern that climate change will change peatlands from carbon sinks into carbon sources. In order to better understand the impacts of climate change on peatland ecosystems, the research presented in this dissertation focuses on several mesocosm experiments conducted to develop {{a better understanding of the}} interactive effects of three key climate change stressors (increased atmospheric CO 2, increased temperature, decreased water table elevation) on northern peatland vegetation structure and carbon cycling functions. Experimental findings include observations that temperatures between 4 and 8 °C above ambient conditions triggered a plant community restructuring event, supporting the expansion of graminoids at the expense of Sphagnum mosses. This change in plant community was associated with an increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and lability, characteristics that indicate enhanced carbon release and a threat to northern peatland carbon stores. These findings were extended through further analysis to determine that differences in plant community structure were mechanistically linked to changes in carbon cycling functions through the introduction of microbial priming-like effects. Specifically, rooting growth forms increased belowground DOC lability, stimulating microbial activity and increasing respired CO 2 rates — likely through the introduction of simple root exudates. These findings were then placed into the broader context of northern peatland climate change research using stable state theory as a framework to clarify the key factors that threaten peatland stability, point towards <b>disturbance</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and provide insights on the short- and long-term impacts of state shifts on northern peatland carbon uptake and storage...|$|R

Critical behaviour of the free-free model is analysed. Properties above the threshold are determined {{with use of}} perturbation analysis. One shows that the first expansion coefficient R(1) of the critical number vanishes. One determines in an approximate manner the amplitude of the <b>disturbances</b> above the <b>threshold</b> and finds that for most nematics the bifurcation is normal...|$|R

We estimate the maximal <b>threshold</b> <b>disturbance</b> up to which the two legitimate users can prove the presence of quantum correlations in their data, in the context of the four- and six-state quantum key-distribution protocols, under the assumption of coherent attacks. Moreover, we investigate the conditions under which an eavesdropper can saturate these bounds, by means of incoherent and two-qubit coherent attacks. A direct connection between entanglement distillation and classical advantage distillation is also presented. Comment: Published online in Eur. Phys. J. ...|$|R
40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) hypopnea {{syndrome}} is a disorder characterized by airway obstructions during sleep; full obstructions {{are known as}} apnea and partial obstructions are called hypopnea. Sleep in OSA patients is significantly disturbed with frequent apnea/hypopnea and arousal events. We illustrate that these events lead to functional asymmetry of the brain as manifested by the interhemispheric asynchrony (IHA) computed using EEG recorded on the scalp. In this paper, based on the higher order spectra of IHA time series, we propose a new index interhemispheric synchrony index (IHSI), for characterizing brain asynchrony in OSA. The IHSI computation {{does not depend on}} subjective criteria and can be completely automated. The proposed method was evaluated on overnight EEG data from a clinical database of 36 subjects referred to a hospital sleep laboratory. Our results indicated that the IHSI could classify the patients into OSA/non-OSA classes with an accuracy of 91 % (ρ = 0. 0001), at the respiratory <b>disturbance</b> index <b>threshold</b> of 10, suggesting that the brain asynchrony carries vital information on OSA...|$|R
40|$|A new, fully-localised, energy growth optimal {{is found}} over large {{times and in}} long pipe domains at a given mass flow rate. This optimal emerges at a <b>threshold</b> <b>disturbance</b> energy below which a {{nonlinear}} version of the known (streamwise-independent) linear optimal (Schmid & Henningson 1994) is selected, and appears to remain the optimal up until the critical energy at which transition is triggered. The form of this optimal {{is similar to that}} found in short pipes (Pringle et al. 2012) albeit now with full localisation in the streamwise direction. This fully-localised optimal perturbation represents the best approximation yet of the minimal seed (the smallest perturbation capable of triggering a turbulent episode) for `real' (laboratory) pipe flows.

30|$|Image segmentation, {{which is}} the {{extraction}} of an object from the background in an image, {{is one of the}} essential techniques in areas of image processing and computer vision [1, 2]. However, in some cases, some undesired <b>disturbances</b> in the <b>thresholding</b> segmentation process may generate a false segmentation result. Uneven lighting {{is one of the leading}} disturbance sources that can affect the segmentation result, which often is produced in the capturing of an image. The primary causes for the disturbance of uneven illumination are (a) the scene cannot be isolated from the shadows of other objects optically, (b) the light may be unstable in some cases, and (c) the object is very large, and thus it creates an uneven light distribution [3].|$|R
40|$|M (Environmental Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This {{research}} {{reports on the}} use of the resilience assessment approach to evaluate the social-ecological systems (SES) at the NWU (Vaal) for a nine month period from March 2013 to November 2013. The research aims to determine the merits of the use of a resilience assessment approach to determine the resilience of the NWU (Vaal) in respect of social-ecological systems. Objectives of the research include the identification of disturbing events to environmental resilience, to construct a conceptual social-ecological systems model of the NWU (Vaal) in order to determine thresholds relevant to resilience and to determine if the resilience assessment approach can be applied at the NWU (Vaal). Data was collected in the form of a literature review, which aided with the construction of a time line for the focal social-ecological system; document reviews, interviews with relevant role players, observation by the researcher and the use of the assessment approach to construct the social-ecological system model. The research findings include identification of possible <b>disturbances</b> and <b>thresholds</b> relevant to resilience of the social-ecological system of the NWU (Vaal). The construction of a social-ecological system model of the NWU (Vaal) aids with proposals to incorporate a stewardship approach which enhance resilience of the focal social-ecological system.

40|$|Many ‘‘natural’’ {{areas are}} exposed to {{military}} or recreational off-road vehicles. The interactive effects {{of different types of}} vehicular disturbance on vegetation have rarely been examined, and it has been proposed that some vegetation types are less susceptible to vehicular disturbance than others. At Fort Riley, Kansas, we experimentally tested how different plant community types changed after disturbance from an M 1 A 1 Abrams tank driven at different speeds and turning angles during different seasons. The greatest vegetation change was observed because of driving in the spring in wet soils and the interaction of turning while driving fast (vegetation change was measured with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). We found that less vegetation change occurred in communities with high amounts of native prairie vegetation than in communities with high amounts of introduced C 3 grasses, which is the first experimental evidence we are aware of that suggests plant communities dominated by introduced C 3 grasses changed more because of vehicular disturbance than communities dominated by native prairie grasses. We also found that vegetation changed linearly with vehicular disturbance intensity, suggesting that at least initially there was no catastrophic shift in vegetation beyond a certain <b>disturbance</b> intensity <b>threshold.</b> Overall, the intensity of vehicular disturbance appeared to play the greatest role in vegetation change, but the plant community type also played a strong role and this should be considered in land use planning. The reasons for greater vegetation change in introduced C 3 grass dominated areas deserve further study...|$|R
40|$|An archival-stratigraphic {{investigation}} of the middle Gila River provides insights into late-Holocene channel behavior and flood-plain formation. Historical records detail changes in channel patterns that correlate with changing frequency of large floods, but channel sensitivity is also affected by factors such as flood seasonality, changes in sediment load, human <b>disturbances,</b> and internal <b>thresholds.</b> Because the frequency of large floods is the dominant factor in channel changes, radiocarbon-dated flood deposits in late-Holocene alluvial terraces allow for a reconstruction of prehistoric channel behavior. A period of reduced large flood frequency and channel stability 4, 000 - 1, 000 years BP separates periods of increased large flood frequency and channel instability 5, 000 - 4, 000 and 1, 000 - 0 years BP. Transformations between braided and single channel morphologies affect the conveyance of floods and change the spatial characteristics of flood hazards. These channel dynamics are also important in analyzing changes in Hohokam-Pima irrigation technology and settlement patterns...|$|R
