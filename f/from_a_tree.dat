5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling close to the ground before disengaging. It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go out {{in search}} of Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz), {{following}} her mother Carol (Melissa McBride) weeping for her loss. Daryl tells Andrea about his childhood, and expresses {{hope that they will}} successfully locate Sophia. They stumble upon an abandoned campsite, where a person had committed suicide by hanging themselves <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> and now has become an undead walker. Daryl insists that they leave the walker alone, but Andrea firmly refuses. He asks her if she wants to continue living, to which she exclaims uncertainty. Daryl euthanizes the walker as they leave. Upon returning to the camp, Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) attempts to reconcile with Andrea by returning her handgun.|$|E

5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing loggers, telling her that another group of loggers {{disappeared}} in the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of security for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and a {{group of}} police search for Lewton's remains. Scully sees blood {{dripping}} on Mulder's face from above and, upon looking up, they see a portion of Lewton's intestine hanging <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the intestine, is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E

But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata {{tells the}} story of Manasa's marriage. Sage Jagatkāru practised severe austerities and had decided to abstain from marriage. Once he came across a group of men hanging <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> upside down. These men were his ancestors, who were doomed to misery as their {{children}} had not performed their last rites. So they advised Jagatkāru to marry and have a son who could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies. Vasuki offered his sister Manasa's hand to Jagatkāru. Manasa gave birth to a son, Astīka, who freed his ancestors. Astika also helped in saving the Nāga race from destruction when King Janamejaya decided to exterminate them by sacrificing them in his Yajna, fire offering.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created by}} Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the most recent, widely accepted one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that it was cut <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.|$|E
5|$|After {{performances}} in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand in March/April 2006, the Rolling Stones tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe; during this break Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> on Fiji, {{where he had}} been on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Two out of the 21 shows scheduled for July–September 2006 were later cancelled due to Mick Jagger's throat problems. The Rolling Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest grossing tour of all time.|$|E
5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the film}} {{takes place in}} Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, {{principal}} photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from {{around the same time}} as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture. However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> was shot in the town square of Blackeberg. Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, was shot in the nearby suburb of Råcksta. The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture. Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio. The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film. Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1889, a range detective {{from the}} Association named George Henderson accused Ella Watson, a local rancher, of {{stealing}} cattle from a fellow rancher {{by the name}} of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to arrest Ella before apprehending her husband, Jim Averell, as well. Both of them were subsequently hanged <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West in which a woman was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future conflicts in the war. County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who would testify against the aggressors. One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Jim's nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shoot-out with unknown suspects, and was presumed to be hiding or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell's, died {{on the day of the}} trial from poisoning.|$|E
