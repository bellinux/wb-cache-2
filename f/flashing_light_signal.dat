The report makes a particular reference to the Transportation Research Board’s Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 69 Section  3.8. 3 [21] which provides a decision tree {{as a tool to}} determine appropriate pedestrian-rail at-grade crossing treatments. The tool has been adopted by TriMet in Portland, Oregon but otherwise has not been validated by research (private communication with Brent Ogden, one of the co-authors of the study, 11 / 17 / 2011).

30|$|AT length was {{measured}} using motion capture assisted ultrasonography (US). With this method, US image coordinates can be transformed to the laboratory coordinate system (CS) for accurate calculation of AT length. To identify the myotendinous junction (MTJ) of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle, a linear array US probe (Aloka 5712, Osaka, Japan) {{was placed in the}} sagittal plane over the right leg 2 cm medial to the junction separating the medial and lateral portions of the gastrocnemius muscle. An impedance-matched acoustic pad was placed under the probe to ease propagation of ultrasound waves, and the probe was secured to the leg with elastic bandages (Figure  1 B). A digital camera (InLine 250, Fastec Imaging, San Diego, USA) was placed on the ankle dynamometer’s left side to image movement of the probe during measurements. The camera’s optical axis was perpendicular to the sagittal plane and the camera was focused on the US probe’s four reflective markers that were placed on the probe handle to enable movement tracking. The camera and the US unit operated at 125 frames s- 1 for the fast loading rate and 60 frames s- 1 for the slow loading rate. The data collection rate was reduced for the slow condition due to memory limitation in the US imaging unit (Aloka Alpha 10, Osaka, Japan). Because the loading rate was several times slower at the slow rate, the lower sampling frequency was also adequate. US images were stored to the imaging unit and the digital camera’s video was recorded to computer for later export. The camera and US images were synchronised with a square-wave pulse that was fed into the US unit’s digital input and used to trigger a <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> visible on the video.|$|E

One out of every nine accidents at rail-highway crossings produces a fatality. In half of these cases, the crossing is an active crossing, meaning that active devices such as <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> with or without automatic gates signal the approach of a train. Annually, approximately 250 people die in crashes with trains at active crossings. Another form of active protection is the use of highway traffic signals. Highway traffic signals have been used as a form of active rail-highway crossing control in several states. The Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices currently prohibits the use of highway traffic signals on mainline track crossings even though these devices are a well understood and common traffic control device at highway-highway intersections, particularly in urban environments where the majority of active crossings are to be found. The objective of this research was to determine the factors that contribute to fatal vehicle train crashes at rail-highway crossings equipped with either <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> with automatic gates, or highway traffic signals. Secondly, it attempted to determine whether the use of highway traffic signals at railhighway crossings offer any safety benefits over the use of conventional active traffic control devices. Fatal accident records obtained from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) were used in this analysis. The driver related factors coded by the police officers in FARS, at fatal active grade crossing locations, were predominantly driver error factors. Three contributing factors that were common to all active crossing fatalities were the involvement of young drivers (less than 30 years old), drunk drivers and the lack signals appeared to offer safety benefits over the other standard active devices with regards to the above three contributing factors, the apparent benefit {{may be due to the}} fact that highway traffic signals experience lower night time train volumes. The accuracy of the FARS database description of the traffic control device was also of concern, after a cross check with the DOT/AAR database was performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{factors that affect}} temporal averaging in rats when discriminative stimuli are compounded following separate training indicating the availability of reward after different fixed intervals (FI) on a peak procedure. One group of rats, Group Differential, learned that a <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> stimulus <b>signaled</b> that one type of food pellet reward could be earned for lever pressing after an FI 5 s interval and that a second type of food pellet reward could be earned after an FI 20 s interval {{in the presence of}} a tone stimulus. A second group of rats, Group Non-Differential, was similarly trained except that both types of rewards were scheduled across flash and tone trials. When given non-reinforced flash + tone compound test trials the interval containing the maximal response rate was no different than on flash alone test trials, although some responding also appeared near the long FI time. After these FI contingencies were reversed (flash signaled FI 20 s and tone signaled FI 5 s), however, further compound test trials more clearly revealed a temporal averaging pattern in both groups. The peak interval was shifted to the right of the FI 5 stimulus. Moreover, Group Differential rats acquired the reversed discrimination somewhat more rapidly than Group Non-Differential rats, and in a final selective satiation test Group Differential rats responded less in later intervals after they had been sated on the FI 20 s reward. These data suggest that temporal averaging in stimulus compound tests occurs even when the stimuli being combined signal qualitatively different rewards, but that decreasing the value of one of those rewards can shift responding away from the relevant time interval in a selective satiation test. However, when an especially salient stimulus (e. g., <b>flashing</b> <b>light)</b> <b>signals</b> a short FI, rats tend to process the compound stimulus more in terms of its individual elements...|$|R

Highway-railroad grade crossings are classified as either "active" or "passive" depending on the ability of the warning system to indicate the presence of an approaching train. Active crossings are characterized by warning systems such as <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> automatic gates, and/or bells which are activated by the detection of an approaching train. Often, low traffic volumes and limited funding do not warrant the expenditure required for installation of an active warning system. A passive crossing results, in that the presence of a crossing (rather than the presence of a train) is indicated by the location of the crossbucks. The driver is ultimately responsible for achieving safe passage across a passive crossing because no warning devices alert the driver of approaching trains. This research involved an investigation of driver behavior at active and passive grade crossings. The researcher observed the behavior of thirty drivers while accompanying the participant in his or her vehicle, directing the driver along a test course which incorporated eleven actual crossing scenarios. Driver behavior at grade crossings is indicative of the perceived risk the driver acknowledges. Likewise, observed behavior illustrates the degree of looking behavior and deceleration maneuvers drivers are likely to exhibit when encountering active and passive grade crossing scenarios. Differences were observed in the looking behavior and deceleration maneuvers exhibited by the participants at active and passive crossings along the test course. Drivers initiated more looking behavior at the passive crossings with the exception of an industrial spur track crossing. The observation of different driving behavior at active and passive crossings leads the researcher to infer that drivers apparently detected differences, either subconsciously or unconsciously, in the degree of warning installed at the crossing. The participants were later told the difference between active and passive grade crossings. The subject was then asked to describe what he or she should or would do when approaching these grade crossing scenarios. Although most responses reflected a general understanding of safe driving behavior at grade crossings, most subjects did not actually perform as they said they would when approaching the grade crossings along the test course...|$|R
