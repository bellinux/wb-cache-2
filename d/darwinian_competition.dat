They obey the biological imperative of striving to propagate one’s own genetic material in the gene pool of the population to the best possible degree, in view of prevailing socioecological constraints. From a Darwinian point of view, differential parental investment can be best understood as a socioecologically contingent tactical measure within an adaptive, i. e., genetic fitness enhancing strategy.

40|$|Competition among firms {{has been}} {{suggested}} to reflect the ruthless logic of Darwinian selection: a free market is a struggle for survival, in which successful firms survive and unsuccessful ones die. This view appears to bolster three pillars of neoclassical economics: (1) that economic actors are self-interested; (2) that self-interest leads to public goods (Adam Smith's "invisible hand"); and (3) that together these lead to market optimization. However, this chain of reasoning leads to a paradox. We show that the application of <b>Darwinian</b> selection to <b>competition</b> among firms (as opposed to among individuals) invokes group selection, which leads to exactly the opposite predictions: notably altruism and the suppression of individual self-interest. We apply an alternative evolutionary model of economic competition, multi-level selection (MLS) theory, which integrates the effects of selection at both individual and group levels. This approach reveals that, while individuals may generally pursue their own self-interest (as in the standard evolutionary account), humans also have evolved traits that-as if led by an invisible hand-steer our self-interest to align with {{the good of the}} firm or wider society as well.

Other works in the series include the piano album Birds and Insects, Book I (2007), the ensemble piece Colmena (2008), and the chamber orchestral work Game of Attrition (2009). It employs transcribed insect calls and dramatic dialogues between instruments of the quartet. These were inspired by scientific studies of insect behavior and interactions, specifically the competition between subsets of overtly aggressive and more peaceful but strategic males of the same species. The work is in three titled movements: 1. Gryllus Integer Based on the calls of the named species (also known as the Western Stutter-Trilling Cricket), the first violin and viola are imagined as cricket 'singers' who try to entice the other two instruments of the quartet to respond to their calls. 2. Double Viols The atmosphere of both ancient life and ancient music is evoked by the non-vibrato sonority of viols. The sonority intensifies and evolves until cricket calls from the first movement arise from the texture. 3. Figwasps The competitive behavior and buzzing sonority of the figwasp is explored in this movement, where instruments of the quartet interact as combative pairs. Glass rods are used a percussive element on the strings in a fast, restless and virtuosic finale.

The hologenome theory considers an organism and all of its associated symbiotic microbes as a result of symbiopoiesis. Microbes, helmints, that normally are understood as parasites, are cohabitants and they have cohabited with their host and drives the evolution and existence of the partners. Each organism is a result of integration of complex systems. The eukaryotic organism is the result of combination of bacterial, virus and eukaryotic DNA and the interaction of its own genome with the genome of its microbiota resulting in an intertwined metabolism (a superorganism) along evolution.

40|$|PTLD may be {{considered}} as an "opportunistic cancer" in which the immunodeficiency state of the host {{plays a key role}} in fostering the environment necessary for abnormal lymphoproliferation. The following discussion reflects our own current thoughts regarding events which may result in PTLD and its sequelae. Many of the individual steps have not been rigorously proved or disproved at this point in time. Following transplantation and iatrogenic immunosuppression, the host:EBV equilibrium is shifted in favor of the virus. Most seronegative patients will become infected either via the graft or through natural means; seropositive patients will begin to shed higher levels of virus and may become secondarily superinfected via the graft. There is a "grace" period of approximately one month posttransplant before increased viral shedding begins. PTLD is almost never seen during this interval. In many cases infection continues to be silent whereas in rare individuals there is an overwhelming polyclonal proliferation of infected B lymphocytes. This is the parallel of infectious mononucleosis occurring in patients with a congenital defect in virus handling (X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder). It is possible that transplant patients with this presentation also suffer a defect in virus handling. In other cases excessive iatrogenic immunosuppression may paralyze their ability to respond to the infection. With CsA and FK 506 regimens, individual tumors may occur within a matter of months following transplant. The short time of incubation suggests that these are less than fully developed malignancies. It may be that local events conspire to allow outgrowth of limited numbers of B-lymphocyte clones. A cytokine environment favoring B-lymphocyte growth may be one factor and differential inhibition by the immuno-suppressive drugs of calcium-dependent and -independent B-cell stimulation may be another. In addition, there is some evidence that CsA itself may inhibit apoptosis within B cells. Since most patients do not develop PTLDs, an additional signal(s) for B-cell stimulation may be required. Indeed, it is possible that the virus may simply serve to lower the threshold for B-cell activation and/or provide a survival advantage to these cells. The ability of individual cell clones to evade a weakened immune system may set into play a <b>Darwinian</b> type of <b>competition</b> in which the most rapidly proliferating cells with the least number of antigenic targets predominate. In this regard, differences in host HLA types may determine the repertoire of viral antigens which are subject to attack. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{evolution}} progresses by essentially {{three different}} mechanisms: (I) optimization of properties through natural selection {{in a population}} of competitors; (II) development of new capabilities through cooperation of competitors caused by catalyzed reproduction; and (III) variation of genetic information through mutation or recombination. Simplified evolutionary processes combine two out of the three mechanisms: <b>Darwinian</b> evolution combines <b>competition</b> (I) and variation (III) and {{is represented by the}} quasispecies model, major transitions involve cooperation (II) of competitors (I), and the third combination, cooperation (II) and variation (III) provides new insights in the role of mutations in evolution. A minimal kinetic model based on simple molecular mechanisms for reproduction, catalyzed reproduction and mutation is introduced, cast into ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and analyzed mathematically in form of its implementation in a flow reactor. Stochastic aspects are investigated through computer simulation of trajectories of the corresponding chemical master equations. The competition-cooperation model, mechanisms (I) and (II), gives rise to selection at low levels of resources and leads to symbiontic cooperation in case the material required is abundant. Accordingly, it provides a kind of minimal system that can undergo a (major) transition. Stochastic effects leading to extinction of the population through self-enhancing oscillations destabilize symbioses of four or more partners. Mutations (III) are not only the basis of change in phenotypic properties but can also prevent extinction provided the mutation rates are sufficiently large. Threshold phenomena are observed for all three combinations: The quasispecies model leads to an error threshold, the competition-cooperation model allows for an identification of a resource-triggered bifurcation with the transition, and for the cooperation-mutation model a kind of stochastic threshold for survival through sufficiently high mutation rates is observed. The evolutionary processes in the model are accompanied by gains in information on the environment of the evolving populations. In order to provide a useful basis for comparison, two forms of information, syntactic or Shannon information and semantic information are introduced here. Both forms of information are defined for simple evolving systems at the molecular level. Selection leads primarily to an increase in semantic information in the sense that higher fitness allows for more efficient exploitation of the environment and provides the basis for more progeny whereas understanding transitions involves characteristic contributions from both Shannon information and semantic information...|$|R
50|$|Social living {{provides}} {{a multitude of}} advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is eusociality, characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of {{the overwhelming majority of}} colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), Isoptera (termites), Thysanoptera (thrips), and Hemiptera (aphids).Social insects have been extraordinarily successful ecologically and evolutionarily. This success has at its most pronounced produced colonies 1) having a persistence many times the lifespan of most individuals of the colony, and 2) numbering thousands or even millions of individuals.Social insects can exhibit division of labor with respect to non-reproductive tasks, in addition to the aforementioned reproductive one. In some cases this takes the form of markedly different, alternative morphological development (polymorphism), {{as in the case of}} soldier castes in ants, termites, thrips, and aphids, while in other cases it is age-based (temporal polyethism), as with honey bee foragers, who are the oldest members of the colony (with the exception of the queen). Evolutionary biologists are still debating the fitness-advantage gained by social insects due to their advanced division of labor and task allocation, but hypotheses include: increased resilience against a fluctuating environment, reduced energy costs of continuously switching tasks, increased longevity of the colony as a whole, or reduced rate of pathogen transmission.Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and the value of adaptability and efficiency under <b>Darwinian</b> <b>competition,</b> all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects. Beyond the rationale, there is well-documented empirical evidence of communication related to tasks; examples include the waggle dance of honey bee foragers, trail marking by ant foragers such as the red harvester ants, and the propagation via pheromones of an alarm state in Africanized honey bees.|$|E

Thus, the proposal that a serial founder effect could have caused the present observed pattern of global phonemic diversity is viable, if three strong assumptions are satisfiedThis work {{was supported in part by}} ICREA (Academia Humanities award to J.

40|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusion (ICF) {{has progressed}} from the detonation of large-scale fusion explosions initiated by atomic bombs {{in the early}} 1950 s to final preparations for initiating small-scale fusion explosions with giant lasers. The next major step after ignition will be development of high performance targets that can be initiated with much smaller, lower cost lasers. In the 21 st century and beyond, ICF's grand challenge is to develop practical power plants that generate low cost, clean, inexhaustible fusion energy. In this chapter, I first describe the origin in 1960 - 61 of ICF target concepts, early speculations on laser driven 'Thermonuclear Engines' for power production and rocket propulsion, and encouraging large-scale nuclear explosive experiments conducted in 1962. Next, I recall the 40 -year, multi-billion dollar ignition campaign - to develop a matched combination of sufficiently high-performance implosion lasers and sufficiently stable targets capable of igniting small fusion explosions. I conclude with brief comments on the NIF ignition campaign and very high-performance targets, and speculations on ICF's potential in a centuries-long <b>Darwinian</b> <b>competition</b> of future energy systems. My perspectives in this chapter are those of a nuclear explosive designer, optimistic proponent of ICF energy, and Livermore Laboratory leader. The perspectives of Livermore's post 1970 laser experts and builders, and laser fusion experimentalists are provided in a chapter written by John Holzrichter, a leading scientist and leader in Livermore's second generation laser fusion program. In a third chapter, Ray Kidder, a theoretical physicist and early laser fusion pioneer, provides his perspectives including {{the history of the}} first generation laser fusion program he led from 1962 - 1972...|$|E
