500|$|The first Kinzua Bridge {{was built}} by a crew of 40 from [...] of wrought iron in just 94working days, between May 10 and August 29, 1882. The reason for the short {{construction}} time was that scaffolding was not used in the bridge's construction; instead a <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> was used to build the first tower, then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building the second tower. The process was then repeated across all 20towers.|$|E

5000|$|Shear {{legs are}} a lifting device {{related to the}} <b>gin</b> <b>pole,</b> derrick and tripod (lifting device). Shears are an A-frame {{of any kind of}} {{material}} such as timbers or metal, the feet resting on or in the ground or on a solid surface which will not let them move and the top held in place with guy-wires or guy ropes simply called [...] "guys". Shear legs only need two guys whereas a <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> needs at least three. The U. S. Army Field Manual FM 5-125 gives detailed instruction on how to rig shears.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gin</b> <b>poles</b> {{are mounted}} on flatbed trucks as a {{primitive}} form of mobile crane, used for lifting and relocating loads, and salvage operations {{in lieu of}} a more sophisticated wrecker.|$|R
50|$|Lifting {{equipment}}, {{also known}} as lifting gear, is a general term for any equipment {{that can be used}} to lift loads. This includes jacks, block and tackle, vacuum lifts, hoists, rotating screws, gantries, A frames, <b>gin</b> <b>poles,</b> shear legs, sheerleg, windlasses, lifting harnesses, fork lifts, hydraulic lifting pads, air lift bags, and cranes.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to ensure that Transpower is prepared to deliver upcoming transmission tower refurbishment projects that are located on sites with difficult access. This project reviews the availability, capability and cost of utilising alternative construction methods and any associated wider issues. The focus of this report is on how Transpower can more effectively utilise helicopters and <b>gin</b> <b>poles</b> for transmission tower erection and material delivery on remote sites...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> is {{considered}} a form of derrick, called standing derrick or pole derrick, distinguished from sheers (or [...] "shear legs") by having a single boom rather than a two-legged one.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> (derived from gyn, a three-legged lifting device) is a {{supported}} pole {{which uses}} a pulley or block and tackle on its upper end to lift loads. The lower end is braced or set in a shallow hole and positioned so the upper end lies above the object to be lifted. The pole (also known as a [...] "mast", [...] "boom", and [...] "spar") is secured with three or more guys. These are manipulated to move the load laterally, with up and down controlled by the pulley or block. <b>Gin</b> <b>pole</b> can also use a guide for building a tower.|$|E
50|$|A derrick is a {{lifting device}} {{composed}} at minimum of one guyed mast, as in a <b>gin</b> <b>pole,</b> {{which may be}} articulated over a load by adjusting its guys. Most derricks {{have at least two}} components, either a guyed mast or self-supporting tower, and a boom hinged at its base to provide articulation, as in a stiffleg derrick.|$|E
5000|$|Temporary sheers {{comprise}} two upright spars, lashed {{together at}} {{their heads and}} their feet splayed apart. Unlike in a gyn, which has three legs and is thus stable without support, stability in sheers (derricks, and single-legged <b>gin</b> <b>poles)</b> is provided by a guy. [...] The heels of the spars are secured by splay and heel tackles. The point {{at the top of}} the sheers where the spars cross and are lashed together is the [...] "crutch", to which a block and tackle is attached. Unlike derricks, sheers need no lateral support, and only require either a foreguy and an aftguy or a martingale and a topping lift. Being made of two spars rather than one, sheers are stronger than a derrick of the same size and made of equivalent materials. Unlike the apex of a gyn, which is fixed, the crutch of a sheers can be topped up or lowered, via the topping lift, through a limited angle. In the era of sailing vessels, it was common for dockyards to employ a sheer hulk, an old floating ship's hull fitted with sheer legs, and used to install masts in other ships.|$|R
50|$|The SeaCart 30 FCR (Folding Club Racer) have {{a folding}} guide {{system and a}} <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> make for fast {{handling}} to and from trailer mode. A low weight interior, shorter mast (less sail area than on the SC30 GP), hulls in e-glass (heavier than the SC30 GP) make the FCR both cheaper and easier to adapt to for a less experienced Multihull sailor.|$|E
5000|$|Gin poles {{are also}} used to raise loads above {{structures}} too tall to reach with a crane, as placing an antenna atop a steeple, and to lift segments of a tower atop one-another during erection. When {{used to create a}} segmented tower, the <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> can be detached, raised, and re-attached to the just completed segment in order to lift the next. The process of [...] "jumping" [...] is repeated until the topmost portion of the tower is completed.|$|E
50|$|The first Kinzua Bridge {{was built}} by a crew of 40 from 1552 ST of wrought iron in just 94 working days, between May 10 and August 29, 1882. The reason for the short {{construction}} time was that scaffolding was not used in the bridge's construction; instead a <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> was used to build the first tower, then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building the second tower. The process was then repeated across all 20 towers.|$|E
50|$|KYNG {{was one of}} four {{stations}} (the others being KXTX-TV, {{and sister}} stations KOAI and KRBV) that fell victim to the Cedar Hill tower collapse on October 12, 1996. Three workers were killed, and one worker was injured when a gust of wind caught the <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> being used for construction of a new antenna for KXTX. After the collapse, the stations scrambled to get back on air and later ended up using an auxiliary site for many months, though at a much reduced power output. Because of this, KYNG's ratings plummeted.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{tower was}} {{near the end of}} construction when the broadcast antenna was being lifted into place. A U-bolt failed along with the pulley in the <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> causing the antenna to fall and snap two of the guy wires holding the tower upright. Three workers riding the antenna {{to the top of the}} tower and two standing on the tower itself were killed. The entire structure collapsed in less than 17 seconds. Video of the tower collapse, shot by one of the station engineers on site for the topping off of the tower, has been posted in numerous places (including YouTube).|$|E
50|$|<b>Gin</b> <b>pole</b> derrick (also {{known as}} {{standing}} derrick or pole derrick) is a derrick without a boom with single tower or mast supported by 4 guy wires (two side guys, fore guy and rear guy). Its guys are so arranged from its top as to permit leaning the mast in any direction. The {{base of the}} tower is hinged {{and the top of}} the tower is connected to a pulley system for load lifting. As this is a simple derrick system, it is considered to be used by some agencies as an improvised rescue derrick in an emergency situation where no suitable rescue derrick or crane is available.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Green Mercantile was {{a wooden}} hotel building built in 1883 and purchased by John Wesley Green. The mercantile became {{the post office}} as well in 1886 when Green was appointed postmaster by Grover Cleveland. After the original building burnt down in a fire that destroyed many buildings in Buffalo Creek in 1897, Green contracted Seerie Investment Company to replace the building with fireproof native granite block. The blocks were hoisted into place with the combined effort of six men, a team of mules and a <b>gin</b> <b>pole.</b> The building has been in continuous operation as a general store and post office ever since, operated by descendants of the Green family.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, KMEZ was {{purchased}} by Summit Broadcasting. After the purchase, KMEZ moved to 107.5 FM, replacing KDLZ. After two days of stunting with [...] "Jam On It" [...] by Newcleus, the station changed formats to CHR/Urban (also known as a [...] "CHUrban" [...] format, which is the predecessor of rhythmic contemporary) and changed its call letters to KJMZ and branding to 100.3 Jamz at 12:01 a.m. on Christmas Day, 1988. During its tenure as KJMZ, on-air personality Russ Parr got his start in the radio business before going to Washington, DC to jumpstart his syndicated morning show, which, at one time, aired on KBFB. In 1995, Granum Communications (later bought out by Infinity/CBS Radio) bought KJMZ and KMEZ (now KMVK), and tweaked the format to Classic and Modern R&B (Urban AC) and renamed the station as KRBV, V100 on September 1, 1995; the KJMZ calls were {{picked up by a}} station in Las Vegas (now KMXB). KRBV was one of four stations (the others being KXTX-TV, KOAI and KYNG) that fell victim to the Cedar Hill tower collapse on October 12, 1996. Three workers were killed and one worker was injured when a gust of wind caught the <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> being used for construction of a new antenna for KXTX. After the collapse, the stations scrambled to get back on air, and later ended up using an auxiliary site for many months, though at a much reduced power output. Because of this, KRBV never returned to its glory days and the ratings sunk, most of it due to philosophical differences in direction of programming for KRBV.|$|E
40|$|The report {{presents}} the {{modifications carried out}} on the CSIR-NMIYI 500 kw wind turbine tower and <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> to ensure structural rigidity for implementation of the non-crane solution for the lifting and lowering of the tilt type turbine tower. The non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) reports on the critical zones of turbine tower and the associated re-welding carried out are included. Details on the design {{and analysis of the}} reinforcing schemes for the <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> top plate and the 70 m dia wire rope anchor attachment are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of wireless communication services {{has resulted in the}} construction of telecommunication towers to hold transmitting devices for cellular phones, personal communication services, and televisions and radio broadcast antennas. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates that at least 75, 000 telecommunication towers have been constructed in the United States, and industry groups indicate that more than 1, 000 telecommunication towers are erected each year [Chiles 1997]. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 - 104) is expected to promote more tower construction to meet the increased demand fow wireless communication services [OSHA 1998]. Telecommunication towers are generally manafactured as sections and constructed onsite by hoisting each section into place and bolting sections together. Some models of shorter towers are self-erecting. For most towers that are constructed onsite, cranes and gin poles attatched to the tower being erected are genetally used to hoist each section into place. A <b>gin</b> <b>pole</b> is used to raise sucessive sections of steel, equipment, or workers into position. This temporaru lifting device uses cables and pulleys to accomodate the length of the next tower section of equipment being installed. The exact number of workers involved in tower construction and maintenance is unknown. Workers are categorized in a variety of occupational subgroups for which employment data are collected. These groups include communications workers, painters, steel erectors, and electrical and electronic equipment repairers. In addition to telecommunication towers, transmitting devices for wireless communication services are often mounted on the roof perimeters of buildings, exposing workers to fall hazards. However, the mounting and maintenance of these devices on buildings require fall protection measures that are not addressed in this document.
