The center is home to 400 {{students}} a year. The project was ratified by the MSU Board of Trustees on January 18, 2007. It was funded by private dollars through a joint fundraising initiative by MSU and Grand Action, a nonprofit Grand Rapids based organization designed to revitalize and attract business to downtown Grand Rapids. A $10 million lead donation of the $90 million construction budget was given by Ambassador Peter F. Secchia.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{intellectual}} effect {{of being a}} TCK {{has not yet been}} widely explored, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have significant findings was conducted on young native Koreans who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were looking to see how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their originality and fluency and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of creativity demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for problem solving than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. This study has implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional curriculum to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of her {{appearances}} in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a joy to play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to [...] "selfish, superficial Los Angeles", which turned out to be her [...] "trial by fire".|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, the Los Angeles Times {{announced}} that the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre would close in the fall, during its thirty-fifth year of seasonal performances. Prior to {{the news of the}} closure, City of Irvine officials discussed continuing the expansion of a local apartment development, which would be built atop the site. Representatives working with Stefani announced on September 9, 2016, that she would be the final act to perform in the theater in an event called Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows, before deconstruction of the facilities began. She spoke of its closure: [...] "I have so many memories at Irvine Meadows [...] It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an important part of my life both as an artist and as a fan and it will always hold a special place in my heart. I am humbled to perform there once again as it comes to a close." [...] In an interview earlier in the week on a California radio show, she expressed her devastation at the closure. It was the venue for her first live performance with her band No Doubt opening for Ziggy Marley in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, {{said that}} the fact Pauline <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an [...] "enduring staple" [...] will {{make it hard for}} fans to cope with her departure. [...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hateâ€”you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E
500|$|Martin Lee {{said that}} [...] "according {{to all the}} {{evidence}} that has been reported, I believe that Mr. Lee had been taken against his will by certain law enforcement agents from across the border through illegal means". He described the disappearances as the [...] "most worrying thing {{that has happened in}} Hong Kong since the handover in 1997". Benny Tai and former chief secretary Anson Chan both said the case poses a genuine threat to the [...] "one country, two systems" [...] principle, which China ought to uphold. Former legislator Margaret Ng suggested that Hong Kong's status as a world city was coming into question, and said [...] "Hong Kong can be deemed to be no longer safe unless we have a clear resolution of the problem". Albert Chan said [...] "this is the first time there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a clear violation of Hong Kong's law, a clear violation of 'one country, two systems' principle, that has taken place in such an open manner", and Lee Cheuk-yan, called the disappearances a [...] "milestone for suppression". Joseph Wong, former secretary for the Hong Kong civil service, also said that the incident will have drastic consequences as foreign confidence in the one country two systems policy may be irreparably damaged, which may in turn jeopardise Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.|$|E

500|$|Besides the {{official}} honours, Shackleton's Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing {{a toast to}} the explorer at a lunch given in Shackleton's honour by the Royal Societies Club, Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chancellor, said: [...] "When one remembers what he had gone through, one {{does not believe in}} the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not believe that we have lost all sense of admiration for courage [...] endurance". The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin Evening Telegraph's headline read [...] "South Pole Almost Reached By An Irishman", while the Dublin Express spoke of the [...] "qualities that were his heritage as an Irishman". Shackleton's fellow-explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that [...] "the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory that can never be surpassed". Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Emily Shackleton, praising the [...] "unique expedition which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a complete success in every respect". The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, {{in the form of a}} grant of Â£20,000 (2008: Â£1.5 million) to clear the most pressing obligations. It is likely that many debts were not pressed and were written off.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Criss as Blaine, a gay {{member of}} a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a [...] "cute, charismatic, gay high school junior" [...] who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once {{for the role of}} Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, [...] "At this point, Kurt's [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [...] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [...] the same things that he had to deal with, and I think he wants to impart that knowledge." [...] Murphy described Blaine as a character with [...] "great self-loathing" [...] and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriendâ€”a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinnâ€”but based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically.|$|E

Murray's eccentric and irreverent style of comedy, both on-screen {{and in his}} personal life, has caused him {{to be seen as}} a folk hero to many making him a significant meme in various media including books and the internet. In 2016 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center.|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2015 USA Today {{article about}} how the actors of The Cosby Show responded to the allegations, Keshia Knight Pulliam of the cast stated [...] "All I can speak to is the man I know and I {{love the fact that}} he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an example [...] you can't take away from the great that he has done, the {{millions}} and millions of dollars he has given back to colleges and education, and just what he did with the Cosby Show and how groundbreaking that was. The Cosbys, we were the first family that no matter what race, religion, you saw yourself in", further addressing the charges against Cosby. [...] "At the end of the day they are allegations ... I don't have that story to tell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Attorney-General Lionel Bowen, {{acting on}} {{what he said was}} his belief that the Justices of the High Court were minded to take some {{independent}} action to assess Justice Murphy's fitness to return to the Court, introduced legislation for a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, constituted by three retired judges, to examine [...] "whether any conduct of the Honourable Lionel Keith Murphy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> as to amount, in its opinion, to proved misbehaviour within the meaning of section 72 of the Constitution". (Section 72 specifies that a High Court judge may be removed only by the Governor-General and both houses of Parliament [...] "on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity".) The terms of this inquiry specifically excluded the issues for which Murphy had already been tried and acquitted.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} such an event has occurred. Explaining the reason for the gathering, Virginia Governor and NGA Chair Terry McAuliffe stated that [...] "India is America's greatest strategic partner". He further added, [...] "We clearly understand the strategic importance of India, of India-US relations. As we grow our 21st century economy, India has been so instrumental in helping us build our technology, medical professions. We recognise a country that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a close strategic ally of the US. That's why we the Governors are here tonight."

2500|$|Consumer Reports {{initially}} {{stated that}} the iPhone 4's signal issues are not [...] "unique, {{and may not be}} serious" [...] and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a problem that Apple made a formal apology. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls. The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who [...] "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" [...] purchase the iPhone 3GS instead. The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a Bumper, a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem. CNN repeated Consumer Reports statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the cast}} of the series {{performed}} a small promotional tour ("The Gleek Tour") at various Hot Topic stores in the U.S. to showcase the series' soundtrack and to meet with fans of the show.

A concert tour was hinted by several cast members via Twitter {{at the beginning of}} 2010. The success of the promotional outing lead {{to the creation of the}} concert tour. The tour was officially announced via Fox on March 1, 2010 at the conclusion of the first season. Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) expressed her excitement for the tour stating, [...] "This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an extraordinary year for 'Glee' and I canâ€™t think of a better way to finish up the first season than performing live on stage with the cast". Her comments were later shared by Cory Monteith (Finn Hudson) stating, [...] "This show has changed my life in so many ways. If you had told me a year ago that Iâ€™d be performing classic rock songs in concert theaters around the country, I would never have believed you. We are psyched!".
