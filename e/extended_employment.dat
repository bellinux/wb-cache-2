The determination of cases, civil and criminal, by means of wager or analogous forms of procedure, was a characteristic feature of ancient law. The legis actin sacramenti at Rome - at first a real, then a fictitious, wager - and the wagers [...] "of battle" [...] and [...] "of law" [...] in England, of the highest antiquity in their origin, survived up to a comparatively late period in the history of both legal systems. The form of the wager survived long after its reason had been forgotten. The general prevalence of the wager form of proceeding is perhaps to be attributed to the early conception of a judge as a mere referee who decided the dispute submitted to him, not as an executive officer of the state, but as an arbitrator casually called in (see Maine, Ancient Law, c. x.).|$|E

30|$|We know {{of only a}} {{few studies}} {{directly}} addressing the issue of subsidies/employment quotas for disabled workers. A paper by Humer et al.

Estimating fixed effects regressions on disabled workers, they show that workers holding a job when acquiring legal SD-status have substantially better subsequent employment prospects after an SD-award than before, while the opposite is the case {{for those who do not}} hold a job at the date of SD-entry. These findings suggest that employment protection legislation places substantial firing costs on firms and has a major impact on the decisions of firms to hire disabled workers.

However, the SD award combines subsidies with other types of incentives to firms so it is difficult to conclude which part of the policy promotes employment of the disabled.|$|E
40|$|Training {{and impact}} on {{individual}} earnings of Displaced Workers The economic policy purpose for providing training for displaced workers {{stems from a}} calculation that relates future individual earnings to investments in human capital measured in time. Hypothetically, if a displaced worker is provided appropriate training, {{he or she will}} {{be able to find a}} better earning position than if left untrained.

The resulting calculation, labeled the "human capital earnings function " (HCEF) is a fundamental tool in researching earnings, wages and income in developed countries. The simple schooling version was first conceived in Becker and Chiswick (1966), which was then extended to include on-the-job training in Mincer (1974). The original purpose for the development of the calculation was to calculate the value of loss earnings due to injury, death or job discrimination. Psacharapoulos and Mattson (1996) extended the model to include estimates of the rate of return from schooling before employment.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of some of the key issues concerning the future of pensions and retirement in Europe. The main theme of the article is that health status has a critical bearing on the future of both pensions and retirement. If ageing populations are unhealthy, not only will this be costly in personal, family and societal terms but, in addition, it closes down policy options which have the potential to offset the ®nancial impact of ageing, such as <b>extended</b> <b>employment.</b> Therefore it is important, in policy terms, to consider the three issues (pensions, retirement and health) together and not repeat the common tendency to separate the social security and health questions. The article focuses on four key issues with regard to the European Union: the reform of pensions, the implications of pension reform for intergenerational solidarity, the future of retirement, and the link between economic activity and health.

30|$|Regarding the {{analyses}} we presented, {{it is important}} to note that the data does not allow for bargaining processes within the relationship to be mapped adequately. Moreover, as discussed in Sect.  3.2, it is possible that women who are less employment-oriented or more family-oriented choose typical, female-dominated occupations. Accordingly, the <b>extended</b> <b>employment</b> interruptions would not necessarily be a consequence of the specific characteristics of these occupations, but rather of the shared personality traits of the women working in these occupations. But we can at least in part control for these potential selection processes by focusing on employment-oriented women in our sample and by considering the educational achievement and the professional position of the mothers prior to the employment interruption. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent family-related attitudes influence job selection in the first place (for choice in field of study e.[*]g. Lörz and Schindler 2011; Ochsenfeld 2016). Regardless of possible selection processes, our results demonstrate that the expected improved work-family balance that female-dominated occupations promise due to higher part-time rates does not seem to be attained or does not provide sufficient incentives for the mothers to return. Better pay in these occupations might provide a more powerful incentive to return to the labour market more quickly.|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to highlight age management within Slovenian enterprises from the viewpoint of older employees by finding out what influences older employees to decide “should I stay or should I go”. The empirical research methodology is based on mixed strategy of approaching organizations (employees), which means that the quantitative (factor analysis, cluster analysis, correlation, regression, descriptive statistics and frequency distributions) and qualitative parts (in-depth interviews analysis) of research were conducted simultaneously. The results of the research indicate that there are in fact two groups of older employees, which can be referred to as “susceptible” and “insusceptible” in terms of how the employer can affect their decisions. “The unsusceptible” have already decided to retire as soon as possible and they cannot be influenced by any employer measure. On the other hand, “the susceptible” employees are sensitive to employers’ measures aimed at prolonging their working lives. Besides, a regression analysis confirmed a statistically significant correlation between the inclination towards extending one’s employment period and the susceptibility to the employer measures. It can thus be concluded that, through age management measures, an employer has an impact on an <b>extended</b> <b>employment</b> period of older employees. However, employers should be interested primarily in those employees who are inclined towards extending their working lives...|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{people are}} living longer, they are being {{encouraged}} to work longer. While {{it is assumed that}} <b>extended</b> <b>employment</b> will be good for health, the evidence has been mixed. This study considers whether employment and job quality exert an influence on four indicators of health status in older workers. " "Methods: Data for this study came from 836 older workers (440 men and 396 women) aged 50 - 59 years at baseline who participated in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Using linear regression we examine within-person change in self-rated, physical and mental health and one health behaviour (physical activi at two time points over a nine year follow-up period. " "Results: There were minimal differences in the way health changed for older adults who continued working compare to those who retired voluntarily. However, when we decomposed employment in terms of job quality, health outcome diverged. Compared to voluntary retirees, older workers who had worked in good quality jobs reported marginally bett self-rated health (0. 14,- 0. 02 - 0. 29); but did not differ in their physical (2. 31,- 1. 09 - 5. 72) or mental health (0. 51,- 1. 84 - 2. 87). In contrast, older workers who held poor quality jobs for most of the follow-up period declined in the self-rated (- 1. 13,- 0. 28 - - 0. 02), physical (- 4. 90, 8. 52 - - 1. 29) and mental health (- 4. 67, 7. 69 - - 1. 66) relative to voluntary retirees. Older workers who held poor quality jobs for just some of the follow-up period did not differ from voluntary retirees in terms of their health. However there was evidence of a linear relationship between "length of exposure to poor quality jobs and decline in health outcomes.

This trial calculation shows that, because reaching age 60 actually triggers retirement of the elderly from labor market, raising mandatory retirement age from 60 to 65 could increase the labor force participation rate of persons aged 60 to 65 by about 10 percentage points. Encouraging labor supply of those aged 65 and over would appear to require redoubled institutional reform, including abolishment of the mandatory retirement age scheme altogether. The working-age population (i. e. population aged 15 to 64) in Japan is projected to decline by 0. 7 per cent per annum from 2005 to 2010.
