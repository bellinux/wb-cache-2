In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close fly-by of Enceladus' south pole, flying within 48.3km (30mi) of the surface, {{as well as through}} a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential oasis of habitability.|$|E

30|$|Active {{geothermal}} {{areas at}} shallow depth have a potential of phreatic eruptions {{because of the}} instabilities in <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities.</b> Minor layers of tephra deposits commonly found near the geothermal area [e.g., Owakudani geothermal area of the Hakone volcano (Kobayashi et al. 2006)] indicate the repetition of phreatic eruptions from active geothermal system. Despite their frequent occurrence and the potential risks, phreatic eruptions remain poorly described, because of poor preservation and indistinctive features of the deposits.|$|R
5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, which probably arose from magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits, seeing as these domes are found only inside the caldera. The elevated temperatures of the caldera lake suggest that <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> still occurs beneath Incapillo.|$|E
5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Tehama started life some 600,000 years ago. At {{its peak}} activity, it reached {{approximately}} 3,350meters (11,000ft) high, with a basal diameter of approximately 12kilometers. Volcanic activity then declined 400,000 years ago, with other volcanic lava domes forming {{at the edges}} of Mount Tehama later on, the largest and best known of which is Lassen Peak. A combination of continued <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> and erosion, particularly by glaciers during ice ages, removed the central cone of the volcano, leaving a large caldera, the northern edge of which can still be seen.|$|E

The Kirthar fold belt north–south tendering tectonic features {{are similar to}} Suleiman fold in structure and style and have stratigraphic equivalence. Kirthar fold belt from its western part connects with the Balochistan basin, and this western margin is associated with <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities</b> (e.g., Jadoon et al. 1994; Khan et al. 1986).|$|R
30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{uncertainty}} related to <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities,</b> significant complexities must be accounted when {{a mathematical model}} is adopted, such as real topography and mechanical heterogeneities, which are indeed neglected by most of existing models [12, 14, 18, 19]. In addition, highly efficient and accurate numerical solvers are required when {{a large number of}} simulation runs must be executed for a single simulation scenario, such as for optimization purposes related to geophysical data inversion or when the thermo-poroelastic response must be calculated at each time step in a coupled hydrothermal/mechanical model [20].|$|R
30|$|The factors {{affecting}} abundance of selenium in coals include coal-forming plants, environments, epigenetic <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities,</b> underground water, and coalification advancement. Selenium in coal may {{adhere to the}} surface of fine-grained fly ash or in gas and aerosol states during coal combustion, and then was emitted to the atmosphere directly, causing series adverse effects on environments. Besides, the leaching effects of selenium from fly ash are a great concern to soil and underground water (Zhang et al. 2007). All information above suggests that Se in coal needs a great attention for environment concern.|$|R
5|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that life exists on Europa, but Europa has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity,</b> a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity.</b> According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

Those in the east zone were formed in the Pleistocene age. Both are paleo-geothermal systems. There are active geothermal systems around the recent volcanoes along the east rim of this district. The centers of the volcanic and <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities</b> seemed to have migrated from west to east east during several million years.

30|$|We have {{provided}} {{an overview of}} variations in the geology, geochemistry, microbial energy metabolisms, and community development associated with global deep-sea hydrothermal systems. Relationships among the geological backgrounds of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities</b> (e.g., tectonic settings, basement rock geochemistry, abundance of sediments, magmatic volatile inputs, and phase separation related to subseafloor hydrothermal processes), physical and chemical variations in hydrothermal fluids, and compositional diversity of potentially bioavailable energy for various vent-endemic chemolithotrophic metabolisms have been elucidated through thermodynamic modeling of redox states in hydrothermal mixing zone habitats. In addition, these relationships have been empirically substantiated by recent multidisciplinary biogeochemical and microbiological studies of existing microbial communities and their metabolic functions in representative deep-sea hydrothermal systems in different geographic locations and geological settings.|$|R
30|$|During {{periods of}} <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities,</b> {{alteration}} may occur in many rock-forming minerals. For example, augite and amphiboles may convert into chlorite; basic plagioclase may convert into kaolinite, sericite and chlorite; iddingsitization of olivine; chlorite may convert into zeolite, carbonate or other minerals; {{as well as}} carbonation and laumontitization of tuff matrix. During such alteration and conversion of minerals, hydrothermal fluids may carry large amounts of secondary minerals, e.g. chlorite, zeolite, calcite and quartz. Under suitable conditions, these minerals would crystallize, precipitate and fill up reservoir spaces, reducing volcanic reservoir capacities significantly (Yu et al. 2014). At the same time, since these minerals are mostly soluble minerals, they provide necessary materials for the later dissolution.|$|R

30|$|The present cruise {{produced}} {{a map of}} self-potential anomalies above a known hydrothermal ore deposit using an AUV with survey height of about 100  m (Figs.  3 b, 4, 5). This map depicts a negative anomaly of a few millivolts spreading 300  m[*]×[*] 300  m. This cruise demonstrates that no complicated data analysis is necessary merely to specify the deposit location. The resultant self-potential signals are higher than the detection limit, even at the survey height of approx. 100  m. This survey height might represent a practical upper limit for exploring hydrothermal deposits with <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities.</b> Less active systems might require lower survey altitudes (approx. 5 – 10  m) (e.g., Heinson et al. 1999, 2005; Safipour et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal lakes are a {{very common}} feature in {{volcanic}} environments, and among these lake Specchio di Venere (Pantelleria island, Italy) has attracted the interest of several researchers due to its peculiar characteristics. With the aim of improving the knowledge of its mineralogy, our work pointed out the characterisation of the bottom lake sediments. We collected and analysed 5 sediments cores around the shoreline, determining the mineralogical phases, concentration of major, minor, and trace elements, and the isotopic composition of carbon and oxygen in the carbonate phases.

25|$|Clay {{minerals}} typically form {{over long}} periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical weathering of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of carbonic acid and other diluted solvents. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after leaching through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some clay minerals are formed through <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity.</b> There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and deposited in a new sedimentary deposit. Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy depositional environments such as large lakes and marine basins.|$|E

30|$|The early Cambrian {{recorded}} {{substantial changes}} in global ocean geochemical conditions and biological features compared with late Ediacaran (Knoll and Carroll 1999; Kimura and Watanabe 2001; Wille et al. 2008): a rapid large-scale transgression {{occurred during the}} early Cambrian resulted in the global ocean transforming to an anoxic environment from an oxic environment in the late Ediacaran (Fike et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2009; Babcock et al. 2015); a biological event known as the ‘Cambrian Explosion’ happened represented by the abundance and species of fossils increasing abruptly (Brasier 1992; Marshall 2006). Based on the geochemical data, the early Cambrian ocean in the Upper Yangtze was strongly stratified and stagnant, with euxinic bottom water (Pi et al. 2013; Feng et al. 2014; Jin et al. 2016) and multiple periods of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities</b> in local areas (Steiner et al. 2001; Pašava et al. 2008; Li et al. 2015).|$|R
25|$|The {{islands are}} part of a {{geologic}} structure known as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc system, and range in age from 5 million years old in the north to 30 million years old in the south (Guam). The island chain arises {{as a result of the}} western edge of the Pacific Plate moving westward and plunging downward below the Mariana plate, a region which is the most volcanically active convergent plate boundary on Earth. This subduction region, just east of the island chain, forms the noted Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth's oceans and lowest part of the surface of the Earth's crust. In this region, according to geologic theory, water trapped in the extensive faulting of the Pacific Plate as serpentinite, is heated by the higher temperatures of depth during its subduction, the pressure from the expanding steam results in the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> in the area and the volcanic activity which formed the Mariana Islands.|$|E
25|$|Possible trace {{amounts of}} methane in the {{atmosphere}} of Mars were first discovered in 2003 with earth based telescopes and fully verified in 2004 by the ESA Mars Express spacecraft in orbit around Mars. As methane is an unstable gas, its presence indicates {{that there must be}} an active source on the planet in order to keep such levels {{in the atmosphere}}. It is estimated that Mars must produce 270 ton/year of methane, but asteroid impacts account for only 0.8% of the total methane production. Although geologic sources of methane such as serpentinization are possible, the lack of current volcanism, <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activity</b> or hotspots are not favorable for geologic methane. It has been suggested that the methane was produced by chemical reactions in meteorites, driven by the intense heat during entry through the atmosphere. Although research published in December 2009 ruled out this possibility, research published in 2012 suggest that a source may be organic compounds on meteorites that are converted to methane by ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

As of 2014, arsenic {{has been shown to}} occur in 568 different mineral species (Nordstrom et al. 2014). The primary arsenic-containing mineral species are sulfides and arsenides, which form abundantly in association with magmatism and related <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>activities.</b> These include realgar (As 4 S 4), orpiment (As 2 S 3), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), and enargite (CuAsS). Other sulfide minerals are also primary sources of arsenic, especially pyrite, which can contain >[*] 2 % arsenic (e.g., pyrite in the Mother Lode Gold District of California; Savage et al. 2000). Pyrite is commonly distributed not only in igneous rock bodies but also in sedimentary formations; for example, under strongly reducing conditions, arsenic is incorporated into authigenic pyrite during sediment diagenesis (e.g., Masuda et al. 2005; Saunders et al. 2008).|$|R

Analysis of the gravity data included the computation of a Bouguer anomaly, upward continuations, as well as residual and derivative maps. Comparison of gravity maps, field geology, geomorphic observations and structural maps allowed us to identify the major structural features. As a result we propose a model of three subsurface structure sources at 0. 2, 1 and 7 km depth from north to south, respectively.
