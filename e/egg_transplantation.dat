40|$|Though the rat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{suitable}} laboratory animals and its reproductive phenomena have been well studied, few studies of the <b>egg</b> <b>transplantation</b> have been made. Therefore the <b>egg</b> <b>transplantation</b> in the rat was tried in order to find out an adequate technique. Fertilized eggs were pushed out from the oviduct or the uterus on the third, fourth or fifth day after ovulation, with Ringer 2 ̆ 7 s solution or rat 2 ̆ 7 s serum as a medium. Then, they were transferred into the uterus through the cervix without operation or through the uterine wall directly by laparotomy of a recipient female, the time from ovulation of which had been synchronized with that of an ova-donor. In addition, the transfer of the fifth?day blastocyst into the fourth?day uterus was also tried. To induce pseudopregnancies, recipient females were copulated with a vasectomized male or stimulated by the faradic current run from induction coil. Some of these recipient females were autopsied sometime after transplantation, but the remainings were allowed to remain to term. The results are as follows. 1) The <b>egg</b> <b>transplantation</b> into the uterus through the cervix showed clearly low percentage of developed eggs in comparison with that through the uterine wall. In the former, the abnormal bleeding into the vagina from the uterus and the abnormal uterine swellings were observed. It is supposed that this abnormal uterine environment influences the development of transferred eggs. 2) Of the third-day ova transferred into the third-day uterus, none could develop normally and it seemed that even the implantation did not take place in most cases. This result probably shows that the third-day uterus is physiologically unsuitable for the survival of transferred eggs. 3) It seems that the fourth-day ova are comparatively resistant against the abnormal environment in uterus or in vitro. But their development is not good compared with that of the fifth-day blastocysts. Better results may be obtained by improvement of the method of egg recovery. 4) The fifth-day blastocysts could well develop, when they were handled carefully. In the cases transferred into the fourth-day uterus, the good result of development was also obtained. 5) The sex ratio and growth of young resulted from eggs transferred were normal. ネズミで排卵後 3 日目, 4 日目および 5 日目の受精卵をそれぞれ排卵後 3 日目, 4 日目および 5 日目の前もつて偽妊娠をおこさせた recipient の子宮に移植した. また 4 日目の子宮に 5 日目の blastocyst の移植も試みた, そして移植のための 2 方法, すなわち手術を行うことなしに子宮頸管からする卵移植と, 開腹して直接子宮角壁から行う卵移植を比較した. これらの結果は次の如くである. 1) 子宮頸管からの卵移植は, 開腹して直接子宮角に移植した場合に較べて明らかに不良であつた. 4 日目と 5 日目の子宮に子宮頸管から移植したものでは子宮の異常がみられた. これは多分子宮頸管からの細菌感染によると思われるが, この異常環境が子宮頸管からの移植の不良な結果に関与しているのであろう. 2) 13 日目の卵移植では, 正常の発生を示した卵は 1 つもなく, 殆どの卵は着床さえしなかつた. このことは, 主として 3 日目の子宮がまだ生理的に卵を受け入れるのに適していないことを示すものと思われる. 3) 4 日目の卵は異常な子宮環境や体外での影響に対して, かなり抵抗力をもつと思われたが, 5 日目の blastocyst よりも発生率は劣つていた. しかし採卵方法の改善は 4 日目の卵の発生に良好な結果をもたらすだろう. 4) 5 日目の blastocyst は体外での障害をできるだけ除去すれば, かなり高率の発生をみることができる. 4 日目の子宮に移植した場合でも良好な結果がえられた. 5) 産児の性比や発育に, 卵移植による特別の影響はみられなかつた...|$|E
40|$|Acidification of the seas, {{caused by}} {{increased}} dissolution of CO 2 into surface water, {{and global warming}} challenge the adaptation mechanisms of marine organisms. In boreal coastal environments, temperature and pH vary greatly seasonally, but sometimes also rapidly within hours due to upwelling events. We studied if copepod zooplankton living in a fluctuating environment are tolerant to climate change effects predicted for 2100, i. e., a temperature increase of 3 uC and a pH decrease of 0. 4. Egg production of the copepod Acartia sp. was followed over five consecutive days at four temperature and pH conditions (17 uC/ambient pH; 17 uC/low pH; 20 uC/ambient pH; 20 uC/low pH). Egg production was higher in treatments with warmer temperature but the increase was smaller when copepods were simultaneously exposed to warmer temperature and lowered pH. To reveal if maternal effects are {{important in terms of}} adaptation to a changing environment, we conducted an <b>egg</b> <b>transplantation</b> experiment, where the produced eggs were moved to a different environment and egg hatching was monitored for three days. When pH changed between the egg production and hatching conditions, it resulted in lower hatching success, but the effect was diminished {{over the course of the}} experiment possibly due to improved maternal provisioning. Warmer egg production temperature induced a positive maternal effect and increased the egg hatching rate. Warmer hatching temperature resulted also in earlier hatching. However, the temperature effects appear to be dependent on the ambient sea temperature. Our preliminary results indicate that maternal effects are an importan...|$|E
30|$|In {{the colonies}} that {{received}} foreign pupae, queens {{moved out of}} their rolled leaf nests after the transplantation and placed the transplanted pupae in a pile which they subsequently guarded and nursed. However, in the colonies receiving 300 pupae, queens removed and threw out some pupae from the plastic container. No pupae were removed by the queens in the 100 pupae treatment whereas between 17 and 45 pupae were removed by the queens in the 300 pupae treatment (mean[*]±[*]SD[*]=[*] 32.1 [*]±[*] 8.7). As these pupae drowned in the surrounding water their potential survival could not be determined. Survival from transplanted pupae into imago workers ranged between 63 % and 91 % (mean % survival[*]±[*]SD[*]=[*] 76.2 [*]±[*] 8.32). Survival, though, was significantly lower when 300 pupae were transplanted (mean % survival[*]±[*]SD, 100 pupae[*]=[*] 83.5 [*]±[*] 3.89, 300 pupae[*]=[*] 68.9 [*]±[*] 3.95; ANOVA including <b>egg</b> numbers before <b>transplantation</b> as a co-factor, F(1, 27)[*]=[*] 94.3; P[*]<[*] 0.0001). There was also significantly lower survival at the 300 pupae transplantation rate if only {{the survival of the}} pupae that were kept by the queens were considered (mean % survival of pupae[*]±[*]SD, 100 pupae[*]=[*] 83.5 [*]±[*] 3.89, 300 pupae[*]=[*] 77.2 [*]±[*] 3.92; ANOVA including <b>egg</b> numbers before <b>transplantation</b> as a co-factor, F(1, 27)[*]=[*] 19.18; P[*]=[*] 0.0002).|$|R
40|$|Swiss albino and C 57 BL/ 10 {{eggs from}} induced ovulations, and spontaneously ovulated A eggs, were {{activated}} in vitro by a heat shock of 44 °C for 5 or 7 - 5 min and cultured {{in the presence}} of 10 /tg/ml of Cytochalasin B (CB) for 5 - 8 h. The activation rate was about 70 % in Swiss albino, 40 % in C 57 BL and 90 % in A eggs. CB suppressed second polar body (2 P. B.) formation in over 90 % of activated eggs, with the majority containing two pronuclei. When eggs were placed in CB-free medium their surface became wrinkled and they formed protrusions of various sizes, which in some eggs detached to form enucleate or pronucleate cytoplasmic fragments; some eggs broke down completely into fragments. In most eggs, however, the surface smoothed out in a few hours and suppression of 2 P. B. appeared to be permanent. The rate of development of these <b>eggs</b> after <b>transplantation</b> to the oviduct was delayed in terms both of cell divisions and of the time of blastocyst formation. Out of 41 implants collected on the 8 th— 10 th day of pregnancy only two healthy looking egg-cylinders were found on the 8 th and 9 th day; both were retarded, at the stage characteristic for the 7 th day of normal development. The reasons for delayed preimplantation development and low implantation rate are discussed. The present experiments corroborate earlier observa-tions that parthenogenetic mouse embryos, even if diploid, rarely survive in the uterus beyond the egg-cylinder stage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose. The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarize}} science-based new treatments for human reproductive failure and future developments. Results. First will be discussed popular but erroneous myths of current non-science based treatments. Then will be discussed new treatments and their scientific base, including ovary and <b>egg</b> freezing, and <b>transplantation</b> to preserve fertility in young women undergoing gonadotoxic chemotherapy and radiation for cancer; new perspectives on human epididymal sperm maturation based on a comparison between ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) with testis sperm versus epididymal sperm; simplifying IVF and reducing cost by more intelligent and milder ovarian stimulation; improving pregnancy rate in older women; searching the genome to find genes which control spermatogenesis and whose deletion or mutation causes spermatogenic failure; and human spermatogenic stem cell culture to treat azoospermia, and to preserve fertility in pre-pubertal boys undergoing cancer treatment. Conclusion. With stem cell biology and molecular understanding of reproductive failure, new therapies for previously untreatable infertility are currently on the near horizon. Conversely our clinical results with new therapeutic approaches are adding {{to our understanding of}} the basic science of reproduction.
