An <b>in-orbit</b> receiver <b>validation</b> campaign successfully performed at the beginning of 2014 during a period of increased solar activity initiated closer investigations of ionosphere induced phase fluctuations. After reviewing mission, receiver and specified performance, in-orbit measurement data are presented and compared with ground-test results.

40|$|The use {{of ground}} gravity data in wellsurveyed areas, {{continued}} upward to satellite altitude, {{is one of}} the most promising external absolute <b>in-orbit</b> calibration/ <b>validation</b> methods for GOCE satellite gravity gradient (SGG) observations. Based on a synthetic gravity test environment – providing in addition to statistical error information also absolute error estimates – several upward continuation methods, e. g. least squares collocation, equivalent source techniques using point masses or area density distributions defined on a spherical surface section, are described, assessed and compared. It turns out that all these strictly local approaches fail to work sufficiently accurate. Consequently, a combined adjustment strategy is proposed, supporting the high-quality gravity field information within the well-surveyed test area with a low-accuracy, but globally defined Earth model. Under quite realistic assumptions the upward continuation is performed with rms errors in the order of 1 mE. The most crucial limiting factor of this method is spectral leakage in the course of an adequate representation of the initial gravity information, which can be overcome by an enlargement of the parameter model in combination with a priori filtering of the initial gravity data.

40|$|The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) is a Fourier {{transform}} Michelson interferometer instrument on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite (NPP), {{the first}} in a series of next generation weather satellites in the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). The NPP CrIS instrument provides radiance measurements with 1305 channels in the three bands from 650 to 1095, 1210 to 1750 and 2155 to 2550 cm- 1 with resolutions of 0. 625, 1. 25 and 2. 5 cm- 1, respectively. The raw interferograms received from the instrument are transformed into calibrated radiance spectra by the CrIS Sensor Data Record (SDR) software. The SDR data will be used to improve weather forecast and understanding of climate change. NPP was launched on October 28, 2011 and the CrIS instrument was powered up on January 18, 2012. Since then, the CrIS SDR team has been working on SDR <b>in-orbit</b> calibration and <b>validation</b> (CalVal).

40|$|Volcanic hazards are {{of major}} {{national}} and international importance, affecting many regions of the globe and potentially {{having an impact on}} people both on the ground and in transit in the air. As an example, the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption affected 16, 000 of 22, 000 flights per day in Europe (a total of 95, 000 flights were cancelled by 21 st April) and the international airline industry lost approximately £ 130 million of revenue per day. This event highlighted the importance of sustained and quantitative monitoring of volcanic unrest. A GMES ‘Downstream’ Service project called EVOSS (European Volcano Observatory Space Services) is developing a portfolio of services aimed at robust volcanic hazard monitoring. Crucially, EVOSS is being driven by the needs of the End Users rather than a technology push for space-borne technologies. The End Users include the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center of Toulouse as well as the Volcano Observatories of Arta (Djibouti), Dodoma (Tanzania), Goma (Congo), Moroni (Comoros), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Montserrat, Seismic Research Centre (UWI) and IMO Iceland. EVOSS is a three-year project that began in March 2010. Its spatial coverage corresponds with the METEOSAT full-disk, centred on Africa and covering the volcanic regions of the Caribbean to the west and Eastern Africa and the Red Sea to the east. Nevertheless, the concept can be readily extended globally. The aim is to provide three services: Thermal Anomalies, Volcanic Emissions (including SO 2 and ash) and Ground Deformation products. The first two will be provided in near-real-time while the third will be delivered following an event. Building on projects such as GLOBVOLCANO and PROMOTE, the EVOSS international consortium was brought together by six Institutional End Users that have responsibility for volcano observatories and observation services spread across eleven volcanic areas worldwide, and experienced in the objective technical needs of managing major, local or distant volcanic unrest. The products come {{from a wide range of}} sensors including SEVIRI (thermal anomalies), COSMO-SkyMed, Radarsat- 2 and TerraSAR-X (ground deformation) alongside SCIAMACHY, OMI, GOME- 2, IASI and SEVIRI for the atmospheric products. These sensors were chosen for their ability to provide high-to-very-high revisits and multi-satellite observations. The data are subjected to systematic <b>in-orbit</b> (intersatellite) <b>validation</b> to minimise errors, while the results, associated with inherent quality/reliability indices, are delivered seamlessly to the End User. Furthermore, the concepts and services will be validated at upto four volcanic sites experiencing severe unrest, at least one explosive and one effusive. A component of the project also focuses on ensuring financial and technical sustainability of the EVOSS model...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the SENTINEL- 3 mission is to measure sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature, and ocean and land surface colour with high accuracy and reliability to support ocean forecasting systems, environmental monitoring and climate monitoring. The mission will provide data continuity for the ERS, Envisat and SPOT satellites. The SENTINEL- 3 mission will be jointly operated by ESA and EUMETSAT to deliver operational ocean and land observation services. Sentinel- 3 will make use of multiple sensing instruments to accomplish its objectives. Two of them, OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Imager) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer), are optical sensors {{designed to provide a}} continuity with Envisat 2 ̆ 7 s MERIS and AATSR instruments. OLCI is based on the opto-mechanical and imaging design of MERIS instrument, i. e. a push-broom imaging spectrometer with five cameras and a total swath width of 1270 km. The acquisition is made for a spatial sampling of 300 m and in 21 spectral bands from 0. 4 to 1. 02 microns. SLSTR is based on the design of AATSR instrument, i. e. a conical scanning imaging radiometer employing the along track scanning dual view technique for a total swath of 1420 km nadir (and 750 km backward). The acquisition is made for a spatial sampling of 500 m (VIS-SWIR) and 1000 m (MWIR, TIR) and in 9 spectral bands from 0. 55 to 12 microns. The first Sentinel- 3 A satellite will be launched in late 2015. During the commissioning phase lasting approximately 5 months, <b>in-orbit</b> calibration and <b>validation</b> activities will be conducted. Instrument will be recalibrated and recharacterized in-orbit particularly using on-board devices which include diffusers (OLCI, SLSTR) and black body (SLSTR). We present here the vicarious calibration methods that will be used in order to validate the OLCI and SLSTR radiometry for the reflective bands. It is expected to check the calibration over Rayleigh scattering, sunglint, desert sites, Antarctica, and tentatively deep convective clouds. For this, tools have been developed and/or adapted (S 3 ETRAC, MUSCLE). Based on these matchups, {{it will be possible to}} provide an accurate checking of absolute and interband calibrations, the trending correction, the behavior within field-of-view calibration, and more generally this will provide an evaluation of the radiometric consistency for various type of targets.

Based on two test periods, the quality of the Galileo orbit determination based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) observations is assessed. The estimated satellite clock parameters are used as quality indicator for the orbits: A bump at orbital periods in the Allan deviation indicates systematic errors in the GNSS-only orbit determination. These errors almost vanish if SLR observations are considered in addition. As the internal consistency is degraded by the combination, the offset of the SLR reflector is shifted by + 5 cm, resulting in an improved orbit consistency as well as accuracy. Another approach to reduce the systematic errors of the GNSS-only orbit determination employs constraints for the clock estimates with respect to a linear model.

Moreover, {{the presence of a}} subcarrier in modern GNSS signals introduces new challenges and opportunities. To take advantage of modern signal structures, codeless processing needs to be modified to recover the subcarrier which can subsequently be used for signal quality monitoring. In this study, codeless tracking is modified for processing binary offset carrier (BOC) modulated signals where a subcarrier lock loop is used to remove the subcarrier component. The performance of the suggested architecture is thoroughly analysed and theoretical results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations. An open-loop, multi-correlator codeless architecture is also proposed to monitor the BOC subcarrier correlation function.
