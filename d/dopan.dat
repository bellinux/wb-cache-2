40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in fabricating polymer optical fibres is the difficulty in attaining a refractive index profile of choice, which requires careful control of the chemical composition. In addition, the use of <b>dopan</b> s to modify the refractive index means that diffusion may be a problem. In this paper we describe {{a new approach to}} resolving these issues, which has many additional benefits. We have fabricated the first microstructured polymer optical fibres (MPOFs), in which the effective refractive index of the fibre is determined by the size and spacing of small holes, which run the length of the fibre. Both single mode and multimode fibres have been made from a single material (PMMA) without the use of d pants. These fibres have been tested and modeled. It is possible to use this approach to fabricate a variety of refractive index profiles...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{have used}} a {{statistical}} simulation based approach to predict variability in the noise margins of 6 T SRAM cell caused by Random Dopant Fluctuation (RDF) for a well scaled 35 nm technology. Impact of RDF on Static Noise Margin (SNM) as well as Dynamic Noise Margin (DNM) has been investigated. Results show that RDF will result in up to 45 % variability in SNM and DNM. This variability will require Data Retention Voltage (DRV) to be increased by 35 % resulting in increase in standby leakage power. In nanometer scale MOS devices, random variations in the number and location of dopant atoms in the channel region of device result in random variation in transistor parameters. This source of variability is known as Random Dopant Fluctuation (RDF). The effects of RDF are accentuated in small geometry devices owing to the small number of <b>dopan...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} hole doping {{mechanism}} in Bi 2 Sr 2 −xLaxCuO 6 +δ (BSLCO). The singular optimum around x = 0. 35 {{is found to}} be connected with a feedback between the doped CuO 2 layers and its dopant reactant [La 3 + /Bi 3 + –Oδ] locking the number of doped holes preferentially on to the universal optimum nopt ≃ 0. 16. Key words: hole doping, cuprate superconductors, overdoped, phase separation The effective charge metallizing the CuO 2 layers in cuprate superconductors must be generated spatially outside in one of the functional layers or combinations of them, usually labelled “separating”, “insulating”, and ”spacing”. Thus the doping mechanism rendering cuprates superconducting is fundamentally different from that in high-Tc band metals, e. g. the superonducting iron pnictides. In the latter 3 d transition metal or anion doping is reproducibly successfull, in the former it has an deterious effect on the superconductivity.

40|$|We present ab-initio {{calculations}} {{based on}} density functional theory (DFT) {{of the effects}} on the electronic bands structure, total and projected density of states of surface molecular adsorption onto hexagonal cross-section silicon nanowires (SiNWs) grown along the direction. 〉〈 111 Continuous miniaturization of microelectronic devices requires a corresponding reduction in feature size, and low-dimensional materials have {{become one of the}} most active research topics in recent years. In particular, SiNWs have attracted much attention due to their compatibility with conventional silicon-based integrated circuit technology allowing potential applications as building blocks in a variety of nano-scale devices such as field-effect transistors (FETs) [1], sensors [2], etc. Thus, advances in doping techniques are required that will allow the introduction of controlled amounts of dopants into nanowires (NWs) without degrading their electronic properties or morphology. Electrical doping for Si NWs has been achieved primarily through in situ doping, with the dopant introduced in the gaseous phase for incorporation during vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth, with metallic nanoparticles such as Au used as the catalytic growth seeds [3]. However, this in situ approach does not always give favorable results [4]. Enhanced surface doping during growth, for instance, competes with <b>dopan...</b>|$|E
