5|$|Resident Evil: Revelations is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes.

5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} <b>different</b> <b>settings.</b> The first section {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a therapist who is a non-player character, from a first-person perspective. The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Two near-contemporary copies, usually {{attributed}} to the Ghent Master of 1499 and Jan Gossaert, were completed while the original was {{in the collection of}} Margaret of Austria, great-granddaughter of Philip the Good. Both present variants of the Madonna panel as the left wing of a devotional diptych, with a donor portrait as the right wing. However, the two donor panels have very <b>different</b> <b>settings.</b> The 1499 version shows the Cistercian abbot Christiaan de Hondt praying in his luxurious quarters, while Gossaert presents the donor Antonio Siciliano, accompanied by Saint Anthony, in a panoramic landscape setting. It is not known if either work is based on an original left-hand panel painted by van Eyck.|$|E

5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and <b>different</b> <b>settings</b> and opponents. Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, {{it is important to}} point out that characteristics known as comparability and variability differentiate good performance measures from bad ones. Comparability is defined as the potential to utilize a performance measure across <b>different</b> <b>settings</b> to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different levels of performance. Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated performance measures through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
