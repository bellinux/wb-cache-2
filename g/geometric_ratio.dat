50|$|Absolute speed error {{causes a}} change in pitch, and {{it is useful to}} know that a semitone in music {{represents}} a 6% frequency change. This is because Western music uses the ‘equal temperament scale' based on a constant <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> between twelve notes; and the twelfth root of 2 is 1.05946. Anyone with a good musical ear can detect a pitch change of around 1%, though an error of up to 3% is likely to go unnoticed, except by those few with ‘absolute pitch’. Most ‘movie’ films shown on European television are sped up by 4.166% because they were shot at 24 frames per second, but are scanned at 25 frames per second to match the PAL standard of 25 frame/s 50 field/s. This causes a noticeable increase in pitch on voices, which often brings surprised comment from the actors themselves when they hear their performance on video. It can also frustrate attempts to play along with film music, which is closer to a semitone sharp than its intended pitch. Recently, digital pitch correction has been applied to some films, which corrects the pitch without altering lip-sync, by adding in extra cycles of sound. This has to be regarded as a form of distortion, as {{there is no way to}} change the pitch of a sound without also slowing it down that does not change the waveform itself.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{squaring}} {{process to}} shape a circular tube into a symmetric square clad tube is examined by a three-dimensional incremental elastic-plastic finite-element method based on an updated Lagrangian formulation. The effects of various parameters, such as <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> R/t, strain hardening exponent n, friction coefficient µ, {{and the length of}} tube L, on the occurrence of collapse in the squaring process are discussed and interpreted in a theoretical manner. The findings show that <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> is the major factor in the process of squaring circular tubes. When R/t= 25, serious collapse is likely to appear. Aiming at circular tubes with <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> R/t= 25, this study proposes six analysis configurations for clad tubes to discuss the possibility of clad tubes avoiding collapse.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} with {{the formulation of}} Meshfree methods for the buckling analysis of partial interaction of composite beam. Meshfree formulations of Polynomial Interpolation Method (PIM) and Radial Polynomial Interpolation Method (RPIM) have been developed where multi-quadric radial basis functions {{have been used as}} the interpolation functions. Comparison of the results for the buckling problem against analytical and existing numerical works showed good agreement thus validates the formulation. Parametric studies have been conducted to study the effect of the method’s parameters to the solution accuracy. The effects of support domain and gauss cell were extensively studied for the PIM method. For the RPIM method, parameters used for the parametric study were the support domain, gauss cell, and shape parameter. Once the optimum values of the parameters were obtained, convergence study was carried out to determine the rate of convergence of the Meshfree. It was found that the use of gauss cell proportional to the number of point gives the best convergence rate for the solution of the buckling load. Parametric studies for the analysis of composite beam interaction and <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> have been also conducted for both finite element and Meshfree methods. It was be observed that partial interaction between top and bottom section occurs for some specific connector stiffness values. The effect of <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio,</b> on the other hand, showed that the partial interaction regime for the composite beam reduced as the <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> increased.

I hereby present two {{different}} methods {{that will allow}} weak lensing shape measurements of galaxies combined with redshift information – 3 D weak lensing – to constrain the dark energy equation of state. The two methods are the <b>geometric</b> <b>ratio</b> test (Taylor et al. 2007) and a shear harmonic test (Heavens et al. 2006). The results presented here use a Fisher matrix approach for each method to place lower limits on the expected cosmological parameter constraints from future weak lensing surveys combined with a predicted Planck CMB prior, fully marginalizing over all cosmological parameters and allowing for spatial curvature. The parameter estimation technique allows for an optimisation of future experiments so that the dark energy parameter constraints, given a specific amount of time on a particular instrument, can be minimised. 1...|$|E
