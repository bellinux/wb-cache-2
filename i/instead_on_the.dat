5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working {{later in the}} flight.|$|E

5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> description of observable behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E

5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the party}} {{nominated}} Thompson for vice president, joining a ticket headed by Neal Dow of Portland, Maine, {{the author of}} one of the nation's first municipal prohibition laws. Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evils of alcohol. The Prohibitionists increased their vote total in the election that year, but still received just over 10,000 votes out of more than nine million cast. Thompson made another bid for elected office in 1887, when the Prohibition Party nominated him for Governor of Ohio. He was again unsuccessful, netting {{less than one percent of}} the vote and finishing in a distant fifth place behind the winner, Democrat Richard M. Bishop. Thompson's vote total was also surpassed by the Republican candidate, William H. West, and the candidates of two other minor parties, the Workingman Party and the Greenback Party.|$|E
5|$|Like Daniel, most {{party members}} came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Elected {{as the head}} of the Maryland branch of the party, he {{attended}} the 1884 Prohibition Party National Convention in Pittsburgh. After being selected as temporary chairman of the convention, the delegates chose Daniel to be nominated for vice president alongside the presidential nominee, John St. John. The party platform was silent on most issues of the day, focusing <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alcohol problem. In the election that year, the Prohibition ticket fell far short of victory, as expected, but placed third with 1.5 percent of the vote—a marked improvement over the 0.1 percent the 1880 Prohibition candidates had received. Further, their vote total in New York—just over 25,000—was more than enough to throw the election in that state from James G. Blaine, the Republican, to Grover Cleveland, the Democrat. Because pro-temperance voters usually voted Republican, many historians credit St. John and Daniel with costing Blaine the election.|$|E

5|$|The castle's {{design was}} unsatisfactory, as its guns {{could not be}} angled so to fire down into the harbour, and its defences were {{considered}} vulnerable to attack. To mitigate this, an additional blockhouse was probably constructed below, closer to the water, but eventually a new fortification, the Star Castle, was built <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring island of St Mary's, which became the main fort in the Scilly Isles. In {{the aftermath of the}} English Civil War, the Scilly Isles were held by the Royalist sympathisers of King Charles I, who gave the castle its current name. The islands were then attacked by a Parliamentary force led by Sir Robert Blake in 1651, who landed on Tresco but bypassed the fort as he took the island. Its Royalist defenders blew up parts of the castle as they left, and some of its stone appears to have been used to build the newer Cromwell's Castle by the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the line was strongly opposed by the S, which put forward a rival proposal {{that led to a}} Parliamentary enquiry. The two companies each had part of their schemes accepted and part rejected. The Ward Jackson group was allowed to build a railway east from Guisborough to Skinningrove with a branch at Slapewath to reach the mine at Skelton. They were not permitted to build their own separate line to Middlesbrough and had to rely <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> M for their connection to the Tees. The S was allowed to build an extension from Redcar to Saltburn but was not allowed to build a new bridge across the Tees. An Act permitting the {{construction of}} the railway was passed in July 1858. The company was capitalised with £120,000, half of which came from the WHH, with Ward Jackson as its first chairman.|$|E
5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E

5|$|Two days late, the {{parachute}} infantry battalions of Stanisław Sosabowski's 1st (Polish) Parachute Brigade {{were able to}} take off in England. 114 C-47s took off but 41 aircraft turned back after Troop Carrier Command decided it would be too dangerous to land if the aircraft were up too long. The remainder pressed on; they did not have the correct transmission codes and did not understand the messages. One of the few messages to get out of Arnhem warned the Poles that DZ 'K' was not secure and to land <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> polder east of Driel where they should secure the Heveadorp ferry on the south bank of the Rhine. The Poles dropped under fire at 17:00 and sustained casualties but assembled in good order. Advancing to the river bank, they discovered that the ferry was gone; the ferryman had sunk it to deny its use to the Germans.|$|E
