5|$|Heroes and {{religious}} masters with above normal height are {{a recurring theme}} in Chinese folklore. For instance, his student Wu Song {{is said to be}} over nine feet tall in the same folktale. In The Story of Yue Fei, the General simultaneously duels with two other warriors vying for first place in a military exam; one is nine feet tall and the other is <b>eight</b> <b>feet</b> tall. A Hagiography of the Taoist saint Zhang Daoling states he was over seven feet tall.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Iwa {{produced}} estimated gusts reaching 120mph (193km/h) across Kauai and Oahu. The {{acceleration of}} the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm surge across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near {{the path of the}} center. It is estimated the storm surge reached <b>eight</b> <b>feet</b> (two meters) on the south coast of Kauai. There, the surge reached 900feet (275m) inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area. The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33inches (516mm) was measured. Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in Oahu. Waves on the coast of Oahu reached 16.4feet in height (3m), and waves on southern Kauai surpassed 30feet (9m) in height.|$|E

5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) and those of Shiva (Shaivite sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with matted hair, wings and <b>eight</b> <b>feet.</b> Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E
5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} Prince Maurice conscripted {{the adult}} {{men and women}} of Worcester to work on the walls, threatening the death penalty if they did not attend. To form these new defences, the buildings outside the old city walls were cleared and six large bastions were attached to them along the north and east sides of the city, while a sconce, Fort Royal Hill was built outside Sidbury Gate in the south, linked to the walls by a walkway. The ditch protecting the new earthworks was relatively shallow at about <b>eight</b> <b>feet</b> (2.4 m) deep, but when combined with the high ramparts of the bastions, which were probably protected by sharpened stakes and a banquette firing platform, the bastions would have been well defended. During the short unsuccessfully siege 1643 and the long successful siege of 1646 the reinforced defences were able to withstand the artillery bombardments – the surrender in 1646 was mainly the result of a shortage of food and the collapse of the wider Royalist position across the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four {{computer}} or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is <b>eight</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, {{and the game}} continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on who takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.|$|E

5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling <b>eight</b> <b>feet,</b> while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
