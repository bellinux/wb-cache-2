50|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>warfare</b> is a {{military}} strategy that blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyberwarfare. By combining kinetic operations with subversive efforts, the aggressor intends to avoid attribution or retribution. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>warfare</b> {{can be used to}} describe the flexible and complex dynamics of the battlespace requiring a highly adaptable and resilient response. There are a variety of terms used to refer to the hybrid war concept: hybrid war, <b>hybrid</b> <b>warfare,</b> hybrid threat, or hybrid adversary (as well as non-linear war, non-traditional war or special war). US military bodies tend to speak in terms of a hybrid threat, while academic literature speaks of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>warfare.</b> For the purposes of this article, these terms are used interchangeably.|$|E

Wojtek was a mascot, pet and officially enlisted soldier of the Polish Army in the Second World War who travelled the desert plains, helped to fight at the Battle of Monte Cassino, before being demobbed with his fellow Polish comrades in the UK, eventually ending his civilian days in Edinburgh Zoo. Although a well-known figure Wojtek and his biography have predominately been used as a means to explore the Polish soldiers’ experience of the Second World War with the result that the bear as an animal is absent. This paper, therefore, puts the bear back into his biography in order to acknowledge the role and lived experience of animals in the military. Further, it suggests that exploring the place of animals in the military requires geographers to articulate the <b>hybrid</b> nature of <b>warfare</b> and also to explore the ethico-political relations this produces...|$|R

50|$|The {{combination}} of conventional and irregular methods {{is not new}} and has been used throughout history. Some historians find {{the origins of the}} concept in the campaigns waged in ancient Hispania by the Iberian leader Virathus or the renegade general Sertorius against the forces of the Roman Republic in the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. respectively. Elements of <b>hybrid</b> <b>warfare</b> are also seen in the concept of la petite guerre , a sort of reconnaissance in force practiced by light troops in European armies during the 17th and 18th centuries. A few examples of this type of combat are found in the American Revolution (a {{combination of}} Washington’s Continental Army with militia forces) and Napoleonic Wars (British regulars cooperated with Spanish guerrillas). One can also find examples of <b>hybrid</b> <b>warfare</b> in smaller conflicts during the nineteenth century. For instance, between 1837 and 1840 Rafael Carrera, a Conservative peasant rebel leader in Guatemala, waged a successful military campaign against the Liberals and the Federal government of Central America utilizing a strategy that combined classical guerrilla tactics with conventional operations. Carrera's hybrid approach to warfare gave him the edge over his numerically superior and better armed enemies.|$|E

5000|$|For {{military}} tactics, Washington's [...] "Hybrid Warfare" [...] {{strategy was}} compared to Napoleon's [...] "Bait and Bash" [...] strategy. Washington's <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Warfare</b> involved the use of hit-and-run guerrilla warfare to weaken the British Army and then use the Continental Army, to fight the conventional battles and sieges which successfully led to his greatest victory at the Battle of Yorktown. Napoleon's Bait and Bash involved luring an enemy into position and attacking when the conditions were perfect which was accomplished during his greatest victory at the Battle of Austerlitz where he deceived the Russo-Austrian army into thinking that {{he was planning to}} surrender by withdrawing from the Pratzen Heights and then used the cover of fog to mount a surprise attack on the weakened center of their lines.

As envisaged, the Territorial Defence Force is to be a part-time, all-volunteer organization, with soldiers receiving 30 days of military training per year. Unlike existing reserve forces, which upon mobilization are integrated into regular components of the Polish military, the Territorial Defence Force will be designed to operate autonomously in home areas and with personnel drawn from the local population.
