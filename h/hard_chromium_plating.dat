40|$|The {{improvement}} of the thin films production techniques leads to {{the availability of a}} wide range of coatings with high mechanical properties difficult to be reached with monolithic materials. Thin coated surfaces reveal promising results in several applications, especially where high wear resistance is required. However, selecting the best solution for an envisaged application is a difficult task because the tribological performance depends on both coating and substrate properties and also on adhesion between the coating and the substrate. Therefore, among the main challenges of the surface engineering are included suitable procedures to assure enough adhesion between the coating and the substrate and calculation methods to predict the wear and the mechanical behaviour of each coating + substrate arrangement. Ball-cratering micro-scale abrasion technique solve partially this problem once it allows to determine the specific wear rates of coating and substrate by only one set of tests done with the coated surfaces. In this paper, prediction models based on the micro-scale abrasion tests, will be presented and discussed. The derived geometrical models allow the study of ball-on-plane contact and also of crossed-cylinders contact. The ability of these models to be applied on coating development was demonstrated applying the prediction criteria to study the effect of coating thickness and the coating intrinsic specific wear rate. The wear evolution forecasted by the model was also compared to experimental results of <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> steel and very good correlations were reached. [URL]...|$|R

Plating process was made by applying current of density (40 Amp / dm 2) and the range of solution temperature was (50  55 oC) with different time periods (1 - 5 hr). A low carbon steel type (Ck 15) was used as substrate for hard chromium electroplating. Solid carburization was carried out for <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> specimen at temperature (925 oC) with time duration (2 hr) to be followed with quenching and tempering.

The microhardness of <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> specimen was measured, and the results show that the high hardness was about (907 HV).

The coatings are sprayed by Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and laser cladding (with a diode laser). Especially, the dry coated samples present a good tribological behaviour, whereas the wear mechanisms are different between APS and laser cladding coated samples. Laser cladding allows the manufacture of denser coatings, thus the mechanical properties are increased while the wear rate was reduced. At the same time, APS coated samples show a lower value of shear strength in comparison with laser cladding. That is the reason why fatigue is the main wear mechanism, and this process is called splat delamination...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHexavalent {{chromium}} {{was recently}} prohibited in the European automotive industry, {{electrical and electronic equipment}} by two regulations of the European Parliament (End of Life Vehicles and RoHS). It is still {{allowed in the}} electrolytic baths for decorative chromium plating and <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plating,</b> but the regulation concerning the surface treatment industry was reinforced, in particular reclassifying the chromic anhydride amongst the very toxic substances. In addition, surface coatings deposited by thermal spraying have already been developed in the industry to replace the electrolytic process. But results are not always satisfactory for porosity and microstructure reasons. The contribution of laser cladding is also studied. This allows the formation of denser coatings. In fact, both processes appear to be very complementary. Thus, it is interesting to compare the environmental and technical results obtained with these two technologies. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} propose coatings, with a justified environmental behaviour, carried out by thermal spray processes (APS and HVOF) and laser cladding (with a diode laser) which could replace hard chromium coatings in order to resist wear and/or corrosion. The originality of this step lies in the optimization of the coating processes, in order to offer transferable alternatives to industrial production. To take into account the environmental properties of these coatings from the point of view of materials and processes, Life Cycle Assessment of the surface coating processes was established, which constitutes the genuine characteristic of the study.

This study investigates groundwater around a former <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> site, {{which is one of the}} registered exceptions where PFOS still is used. Five different located sampling points were collected and analyzed from this site in Iggesund, which is in the northern parts of Sweden.

The 6 : 2 telomer substances is being used as a replacement for similar compounds with longer carbon chains, but are believed to undergo biotransformation to persistent alkyl acids like perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in the environment. Solid phase extraction was performed on 500 mL filtered groundwater with and the concentrated samples were analyzed on an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC), tandem mass spectrometer. The glass microfiber filters used for filtrating the groundwater were analyzed for particle bound PFASs. Results from the water extraction analysis showed eight detected PFAS, with PFOS as the major contributor (72 - 9600 ng/L). The PFOS concentrations differs substantially between the five groundwater samples where the two sampling points located south of the facility, and closest to the actual <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plating,</b> were clearly higher than the other three. Two other substances detected in high concentration were perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBuS), 8 - 1550 ng/L, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), 18 - 140 ng/L which can be produced as an impurity during the production of PFOS. PFCAs in all samples were detected in lower concentrations (1 - 25 ng/L). Additional to the PFAS analysis, the groundwater was also measured for chromium since the carcinogenic hexavalent form is used in the chromic acid bath during <b>hard</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>plating.</b> In the same two samples that had the highest PFAS concentration, chromium was found in high concentration, 34900 - 44800 μg/L.
