They had the guts to push around people, do things I couldn't— perhaps did not even want to do myself. But I'd want a friend like that (laughs). I used to adulate them like heroes. That was my first touch with anti-socialism. Over a period of time, I developed a low-angle fascination for larger than life people. I was always a loner - not because I was unhappy, but because I live away from myself, not just others. I like to study myself - the way I am walking, talking, behaving. My constant obsession with studying myself and other people is perhaps the primary motivation for me to be a filmmaker.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the use of the Internet <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classroom,</b> and what effects it may have on {{vocabulary}} comprehension and student motivation in the content areas. Along with my class, three other first grade classes completed a science unit on weather. The other three classes employed a traditional method of teaching using the science book, workbook, and suggested experiments. My class used some of these methods along with the use of the Internet as a source of information and research. All four classes took a Chapter Test and an Outcome Test to determine mastery of the weather objectives. After comparing the results of the tests I concluded that there appeared to be no connection between the use of the Internet and higher scores on the Chapter Test and Outcome Test. Through observations and interviews <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classroom</b> I found that students were more motivated to complete a learning task while using the Internet, student behavior during science improved, and students spent more time on task when using the Internet.
