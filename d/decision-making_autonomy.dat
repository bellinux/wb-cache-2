Low birth weight (LBW), {{an outcome of}} maternal undernutrition, is a major public health concern in Bangladesh {{where the problem is}} most prominent. Women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> is likely an important factor influencing maternal and child health outcomes. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effect of women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> on infant’s birth weight (BW). Methods. The study included data of 2175 enrolled women (14 – 45 years of age) from the Maternal and Infant Nutritional Intervention in Matlab (MINIMat-study) in Bangladesh. Pearson’s chi-square test, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and logistic regression analysis were applied at the collected data. Results. Women with lowest <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> were significantly more likely to have a low birth weight (LBW) child, after controlling for maternal age, education (woman’s and her husband’s), socioeconomic status (SES) (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 4; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 0, 1. 8). BW was decreased significantly among womenwith lowest decisionmaking autonomy after adjusting for all confounders. Conclusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> in {{developing}} settings {{has been shown}} to improve child survival and health outcomes. However, little research has addressed possible connections between women’s autonomy and children’s schooling. OBJECTIVE—To examine the relationship between rural women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> and enrollment status of primary school-age children living in their households and how this relationship differs by child’s gender. METHODS—The analysis uses data from a 2009 survey of rural households in four districts of Gaza province in southern Mozambique. Multilevel logistic models predict the probability of being in school for children between 6 and 14 years old. RESULTS—The results show a positive association of women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> with the probability of being enrolled in primary school for daughters, but not for sons. The effect of women’s autonomy is net of other women’s characteristics typically associated with enrollment and does not mediate the effects of those characteristics. CONCLUSIONS—Based on the results, we argue that women with higher levels of <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> may have a stronger preference for daughters ’ schooling and may have a greater say in making and implementing decisions regarding daughters ’ education, compared to women with lower autonomy levels.

40|$|The {{importance}} of women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> has recently {{emerged as a}} key factor in influencing reproductive preferences and demand for family planning in developing countries. In this study, the effect of direct indicators of women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> on fertility preferences and ever-use of modern contraception is examined using logistic regression models with and without proxy indicators. The results provide evidence that different dimensions of women’s autonomy influence the outcome variables differently in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. Particularly, women’s final say in decisions regarding day-to-day household purchases and spousal communication about family planning are influential predictors of fertility preferences and ever-use of modern family planning methods. At the same time, results show that the effects of women’s education on fertility preferences are not always significant although it has significant roles in affecting women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy.</b> Women’s household economic situation has always significant effects on women’s autonomy as well as on fertility preferences and ever use of contraception. Thus, a complete explanation of the relationship between women’s autonomy and reproductive preferences must recognize the effects of both proxy and direct indicators of women’s autonomy. Interventions are needed to improve women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> and strengthen their negotiating capacity for family planning use if an increased desire to limit fertility is to be attained.

During this time, researchers, using a variety of different method-ological techniques, have attempted to disentangle the potential gender differences among correctional personnel. In building on this research, the following study surveyed correctional staff at a Midwestern high security state prison in the fall of 2000 in order to determine whether male and female correctional staff differed in their perceptions of the work environment, as well as their general attitudes toward their jobs. A total of 28 work environment indices were measured, including occupational attitudes not traditionally examined. Bivariate results indicated gender differences in perceptions of dangerousness, role ambiguity, role conflict, input into <b>decision-making,</b> job <b>autonomy,</b> supervision, punishment ideology, and job satisfaction; however, after controlling for age, race, education, position, tenure, and supervisory status, only dangerousness and job satisfaction remained statistically significant.

40|$|Current {{research}} and policy on maternal and child health-care in Eritrea and Ethiopia focus primarily on female education and employment, while little attention is placed on women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy.</b> However, the role of women’s decision-making in reproductive health cannot be overemphasized. In this paper, different dimensions of women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> {{and their relationship to}} maternal and child health-care utilization are investigated using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys of Ethiopia and Eritrea. We simultaneously consider the role of socio-economic (indirect) indicators of women’s status. The study shows that most autonomy indicators are important predictors of maternal and child health-care utilization although the strength and statistical significance vary by health-care utilization outcome and country, and in some cases significance is lost when socio-economic indicators are held constant. The strong positive effect of women’s sole decision-making in visiting family or relatives on use of antenatal care and child immunization is particularly impressive. On the other hand, the loss of significance of other dimensions of women’s decision-making when socio-economic factors are controlled for indicates that some health-care seeking behaviours are more dependent on socio-economic factors like education and employment. The results show that most socio-economic indicators have strong influence on both women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy</b> and on maternal and child health-care utilization. These findings suggest that both women’s autonomy and socio-economic indicators should be analyzed in order to derive a complete understanding of the determinants of maternal and child health-care utilization.

In order to test these hypotheses, a multiple regression analysis was conducted. We found that Chinese companies apply no rigid rules regarding authority over decision making in their subsidiaries. Although the reliance on reverse knowledge transfer exerts a strong and positive influence on the subsidiary’s decision-making auton-omy, state ownership of Chinese parent companies is not an important determinant of subsidiary autonomy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A short {{product design}} cycle is {{critical}} {{for the success of}} companies in the era of time-based competition especially when companies are distributing design activities across regions to better penetrate local markets. Effectively managing distributed design activities, however, is extremely difficult because of intrinsic uncertainties of the design process compounding with complicating factors such as high re-design efforts caused by the early beginning of activities with preliminary information, and individual organization’s proprietary information and <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy.</b> This paper studies the scheduling and coordination of distributed design projects. The interrelationship between re-design efforts and activities ’ beginning times is captured as the “progress dependent re-design probability ” in a decentralized optimization model. A new stochastic dynamic programming algorithm is developed to handle the re-design probabilities under a two-level Lagrangian relaxation framework. Numerical results demonstrate that an appropriate tradeoff between early start and low re-design efforts can be achieved, and near optimal solutions are obtained without accessing individual’s proprietary information nor intruding their <b>decision-making</b> <b>autonomy...</b>|$|E

In particular, the concept of <b>autonomy</b> in <b>decision-making</b> in a sample of UK-European equity joint ventures is examined. The study adopts a multi-method personal interview and self-administered questionnaire approach to examine managerial perceptions of <b>decision-making</b> and <b>autonomy</b> in the parent firms and the joint venture. The findings show that there are differences in the perception of autonomy between each of the parent firms, and between the parent firms and the IJV management. When we unpack the nature of autonomy in detail, it is found that IJV managers have greater degrees of operational autonomy than strategic autonomy and that decision making by IJV managers takes place within the context of constraints set within the IJV's business plan. This confirms the transaction cost theory which posits that key internal markets (for management, technology and capital) will be under parent control and also supports the resource based view that key capabilities are protected under the business plan established by the parent firms. The influence on IJV autonomy of the moderating variables IJV performance and IJV duration are also examined...|$|R
