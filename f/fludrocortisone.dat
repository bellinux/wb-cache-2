40|$|Abstract Introduction Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APS) {{is characterized}} by recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). This syndrome {{may be associated with}} connective tissue disorders, or with malignancies, but it may also appear in isolated form (primary APS). We report on a pediatric patient presenting with acute adrenal failure as the first manifestation of primary APS. Case report A previously healthy 11 -year-old boy developed fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed nodular lesions in the adrenal glands. He was referred to our Department and a diagnosis of APS and acute adrenal failure was considered, based on positive aPLs (IgG and IgM), elevated ACTH levels and low cortisol levels. Other features were anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated inflammatory parameters, hypergammaglobulinemia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, positive antinuclear, anticardiolipin, anti-platelet antibodies, with negative double-stranded DNA antibodies. Lupus anticoagulant and Coomb’s tests were positive. MRI revealed a bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. A treatment with intravenous metylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisone and anticoagulant, was started, resulting in a progressive improvement. After 2 months he also showed hyponatremia and elevated renine levels, indicating a mineralcocorticoid deficiency, requiring <b>fludrocortisones</b> therapy. Conclusion The development of acute adrenal failure from bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in the context of APS is a rare but life-threatening event that should be promptly recognized and treated. Moreover, this case emphasizes the importance of the assessment of aPLs in patients with acute adrenal failure {{in the context of an}} autoreaction. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that overtreatment of infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency might affect their growth and final height. ObjectiveTo assess the axiological parameters of infants with CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency from their first presentation in neonatal period and during infancy, in an attempt to decide the optimum doses of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and salt therapy that can achieve androgen suppression, prevent life-threatening salt-wasting crises, and allow normal growth velocity for age. Materials and methodsRetrospective study conducted in the Diabetes Endocrine and Metabolism Pediatric Unit at Children’s Hospital, Cairo University included baseline and follow-up data of 28 infants with 21 -hydroxylase deficiency. ResultsMedian age at presentation was 34 days. Lower doses of hydrocortisone (< 20 mg/m 2 /day) were associated with better growth, not reaching a statistical significance. Delta change in length standard deviation score (SDS) was significantly higher in males (p= 0. 01). Delta change in length and weight SDS of cases with mean basal length SDS below − 2 were significantly higher than those with mean basal length SDS above − 2 (p= 0. 02 and 0. 04 respectively). No correlations were found between delta height-SDS and age at diagnosis, duration of follow-up, glucocrticoid or mineralocorticoid dosing. ConclusionPoor growth in infants with salt wasting CAH was not related to age at diagnosis and start of therapy, doses of glucocorticoid, <b>fludrocortisones,</b> or saline therapy. Male sex and mean basal length SDS below − 2 were associated with a more favorable growth catch up. Further prospective studies with inclusion of intercurrent illnesses and nutritional status are needed...|$|R
25|$|Hydrocortisone, <b>fludrocortisone,</b> and {{prednisone}} {{were available}} by the late 1950s. By 1980 all of the relevant steroids could be measured in blood by reference laboratories for patient care. By 1990 nearly all specific genes and enzymes had been identified.|$|E
25|$|Mineralocorticoids are {{replaced}} in all infants with salt-wasting {{and in most}} patients with elevated renin levels. <b>Fludrocortisone</b> is the only pharmaceutically available mineralocorticoid and is usually used in doses of 0.05 to 2mg daily. Electrolytes, renin, and blood pressure levels are followed to optimize the dose.|$|E
25|$|The {{mineralocorticoid}} {{aspect of}} severe 3β-HSD CAH {{is similar to}} those of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Like other enzymes involved in early stages of both aldosterone and cortisol synthesis, the severe form of 3β-HSD deficiency can result in life-threatening salt-wasting in early infancy. Salt-wasting is managed acutely with saline and high-dose hydrocortisone, and long-term <b>fludrocortisone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The data below {{refer to}} oral administration. Oral potency {{may be less}} than {{parenteral}} potency because significant amounts (up to 50% in some cases) may not reach the circulation. <b>Fludrocortisone</b> acetate and deoxycorticosterone acetate are, by definition, mineralocorticoids rather than glucocorticoids, {{but they do have}} minor glucocorticoid potency and are included in this table to provide perspective on mineralocorticoid potency.|$|E
25|$|In {{adults with}} septic shock and {{refractory}} hypotension despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, hydrocortisone {{is the preferred}} corticosteroid. It can be divided in several doses or administered as a continuous infusion. <b>Fludrocortisone</b> is optional in CIRCI, and dexamethasone is not recommended. Little evidence is available to judge when and how corticosteroid therapy should be stopped; guidelines recommend tapering corticosteroids when vasopressors are no longer needed.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{is a type}} of {{corticosteroid}} medication. It is used in {{the treatment}} of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it should be used together with a medication that has greater mineralocorticoid effects such as <b>fludrocortisone.</b> In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby. It may be taken by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, or intravenously. The effects of dexamethasone are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days.|$|E
500|$|Tricyclics {{and other}} pre-1980s {{antidepressants}} had several side effects {{due to their}} non-selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective {{and one of the}} first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [...] citalopram, its isomer escitalopram, and fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: <b>fludrocortisone</b> is a blood pressure-raising mineralocorticoid, and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated; the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and desflurane are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.|$|E

2500|$|One {{particularly}} serious problem, {{the drop}} in blood pressure upon standing up (with risk of fainting and thus injury from falling) often responds to <b>fludrocortisone,</b> a synthetic mineralocorticoid. Another common drug treatment is midodrine (an alpha-agonist). Non-drug treatments include [...] "head-up tilt" [...] (elevating {{the head of the}} whole bed by about 10 degrees), salt tablets or increasing salt in the diet, generous intake of fluids, and pressure (elastic) stockings. Avoidance of triggers of low blood pressure (such as hot weather, alcohol, and dehydration) are crucial.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fludrocortisone,</b> {{also known}} as 9α-fluorocortisol (9α-fluorohydrocortisone) or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a halogenated derivative of cortisol (11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione). Specifically, it is a modification of cortisol with a fluorine atom substituted in place of one hydrogen atom at the C9α position. Fluorine is a good bioisostere for hydrogen because it is similar in size, with the major difference being in its electronegativity. The acetate form of <b>fludrocortisone,</b> <b>fludrocortisone</b> acetate, is the C21 acetate ester of <b>fludrocortisone,</b> and is hydrolyzed into <b>fludrocortisone</b> in the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludrocortisone</b> {{is also a}} {{confirmation}} test for diagnosing Conn's syndrome (aldosterone producing-adrenal adenoma), the <b>fludrocortisone</b> suppression test. Loading the patient with <b>fludrocortisone</b> would suppress serum aldosterone level in a normal patient, whereas the level will not be altered in a Conns patient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludrocortisone</b> is a {{corticosteroid}} {{and acts}} as a powerful mineralocorticoid along with some additional but comparatively very weak glucocorticoid activity.

5000|$|<b>Fludrocortisone</b> {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of cerebral salt wasting syndrome. [...] It is used primarily to replace the missing hormone aldosterone in various forms of adrenal insufficiency such as Addison's disease and the classic salt wasting (21-hydroxylase deficiency) form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Due to its effects on increasing Na+ levels, and therefore blood volume, <b>fludrocortisone</b> is the first line of treatment for orthostatic intolerance and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).It can be used to treat low blood pressure.|$|E
