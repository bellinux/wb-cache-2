The tractors were of the same engine power as well as type of gearbox (PowerShift – gears full shifted while loaded). We were dealing with the wheeled tractor John Deere 8320 and crawler tractor John Deere 8320 RT. The measurement was implemented in the land register of Vrbovec (Znojmo region) {{in an area where}} green peas were grown as the main product and winter wheat as the preceding crop. The measured and the counterproductive tractors were interconnected by the rope containing strain-gauge force sensors. The wheeled tractor was decelerated by the tractor crawler. The tractor crawler was decelerated by two wheeled tractors. The wheeled tractor’s stress-strain properties were also measured applying two pressure rating alternatives. Variant A presented <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of 160 <b>kPa</b> on the front axle and of 140 kPa on the rear axle. Variant B applied <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of 120 <b>kPa</b> on the front axle and of 100 kPa on the rear axle. Measured and calculated findings reveal that the tractor crawler achieved higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip than the wheeled tractor with both variants of inflation. Comparing the stress-strain characteristics of the wheeled tractor with a different tire inflation illustrates that using variant B, higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip were measured...|$|R

The present study aimed to investigate the influence of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> and wheel load on the traction performance of a mechanical front wheel drive MFWD tractor (65 kW engine power) on an agricultural clay (C) Vertic Cambisol on the basis of results of traction tests and simulations with a semi-empirical soil-tyre interaction model adapted for MFWD vehicles.

Traction performance was considered in terms of drawbar pull, traction coefficient, tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption in relation to wheel slip.

This research investigated the effect of tyre load and <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> on soil compaction-related factors. These factors include rut width, rut depth, cone index and horizontal force in different layers of soil profile. In this research a stiff carcass tyre has been used and a soil compaction profile sensor in controlled soil bin laboratory conditions. This sensor consisted of eight flaps, each equipped with strain gauges, installed on a subsoiler leg face with working depth of 45 cm. Studies were conducted using a factorial experiment at two levels of axle load of 6. 3 kN and 23. 9 kN and three levels of <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of 324 <b>kPa,</b> 524 kPa and 724 kPa with three replications in a randomized complete design.

The soil compaction profile sensor measured soil compaction at different layers from soil surface to 45 cm depth at 5 cm interval. The results of experiments indicated that vertical load significantly affected the horizontal force at different tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> on the soil profile. The tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> exhibited greater effects on shallow depths than those of higher depths.

Current mixture design procedures using the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC) rely on volumetric properties of the compacted mixture to assure reliable performance; however, a definitive performance test does not exist. This study provides guidance for selecting a laboratory performance test for airport HMA mixture designs based on; (a) data analyses of results from four potential laboratory tests, (b) comparisons of laboratory tests results to full-scale accelerated pavement test results, and (c) analyses of results from finite element simulations. The laboratory study evaluated of the repeated load test, the static creep test, the dynamic modulus test, and the Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA) test as potential performance tests to accompany airport HMA mixture design with a goal of providing acceptable threshold test results that predict rutting performance under aircraft traffic. Over 340 specimens were tested from 34 asphalt mixtures. Specific criteria for each test method were developed. Next, the test methods and criteria were applied to an HMA mixture design selected for accelerated pavement testing. The full-scale tests applied wheel loads that simulated both military fighter aircraft and heavy cargo aircraft traffic to a pavement constructed to meet typical airport design standards. In the first test, simulating fighter jet aircraft, the tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was 2241 <b>kPa,</b> and the pavement temperature was maintained at 43 ?C. The second test, simulating cargo aircraft, used a tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of 980 <b>kPa</b> and a pavement temperature of 25 ?C. As expected, rutting was much more severe in the first test. The full-scale tests were then simulated computationally using finite element modeling. The asphalt layer was modeled using the nonlinear viscoelastic, viscoplastic components of the Pavement Analysis Using Nonlinear Damage Approach (PANDA) model. The pavement sections and wheel loads from the field-tests were recreated using two-dimensional simulations within ABAQUS. The simulations resulted in very high rates of viscoplastic strain for {{the conditions of the}} first test, but almost no permanent deformation in the second test.

The application of a meta-heuristic evolutionary optimization method, imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), for minimization of energy loss due to wheel rolling resistance in a soil bin facility equipped with single-wheel tester is discussed.

The cores were sampled before and after seedbed preparation, {{in order to obtain}} a large variation in bulk density. (2) Plants grown in field experiments, with and without recompaction in three primary tillage systems: mouldboard ploughing, chisel ploughing to 10 cm, chisel ploughing to 20 cm. The recompacted plots were trafficked twice track-by-track with a tractor, weight 4500 kg, <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> 50 <b>kPa.</b> In the soil cores, no general relationship between yield and bulk density was found. However, the average yield was higher in cores sampled after seedbed preparation, indicating a positive effect of recompaction on yield.

In the field experiment there was a large and statistically significant increase in yield in recompacted plots, regardless of primary tillage system. In non compacted plots, the bulk density was similar for the different tillage systems to a depth of 10 cm. In the layer 10 - 25 cm it was highest in the treatment which was chiseled to 10 cm. In compacted plots, {{there was no significant difference}} in bulk density between the tillage systems.

40|$|Good soil {{structure}} {{is important to}} have the right conditions for good crop development. In two field experiments, R 2 - 4111 and R 2 - 7115, the {{soil structure}} has been examined by a number of parameters. Project R 2 - 4111, started in 1999, investigates how the time of primary tillage affects the yield. Both tillage with a mouldboard plough and a stubble cultivator is tested at three different occasions, called early, normal and late tillage. Project R 2 - 7115, started in 1997, investigates how the tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> affects the yield. Tillage with a mouldboard plough and a stubble cultivator tested with normal and low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> in the tires, also a treatment with permanent grassland is used as a comparison. Parameters that were compared were hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, tensile strength, aggregate stability, penetration resistance {{and the quality of the}} seedbed. Draught requirement was measured at each primary tillage occasion. The results showed no major differences in soil properties depending on tillage time or tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure,</b> but there were trends that the soil structure was poorer in treatments with normal <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> and late tillage [...] Distinct differences were found between mouldboard plough and stubble cultivator treatments for some of the parameters. The stubble cultivated treatment had a higher proportion of soil aggregates > 5 mm and lower proportion of aggregates < 2 mm after sowing than the treatment with mouldboard plough. For the stubble cultivated plots the penetration resistance were higher at the depth of 10 - 30 cm. In the stubble cultivated treatments the bulk density was higher and the hydraulic conductivity lower, but the results for hydraulic conductivity were insecure because of the great variability for this property. In the treatment with mouldboard plough the aggregate stability was lower than for stubble cultivation. The tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> affected the penetration resistance, where the treatment with low tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> had a lower penetration resistance at the level of 12 - 25 cm. Ploughless tillage was cheaper than tillage with a mouldboard plough but between the different times of tillage there were only small differences in machinery costs. The treatment with low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was more expensive to till than the treatment with normal <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure.</b> The early tillage in R 2 - 4111 has had the best yield as an average for several years and the late tillage the lowest yield. The time of tillage was most important in the stubble cultivated treatments. In experiment R 2 - 7115 there were no differences in yield between the tillage systems but the treatment with low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> has had the best yield as an average for several years. To a farmer with an aim to achieve as good economy as possible, these field trials show that tillage with a stubble cultivator on this soil reduces costs without lowering crop yield. Early tillage and low tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> increases yield which may further improve the economy...|$|R
