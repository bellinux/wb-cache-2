25|$|Despite {{wanting to}} avoid making the {{character}} a composite, Judi Beecher provided Madison's voice, {{as well as her}} facial motion capture. Heavy Rain marked Beecher's first role in a video game, having previously had a background in theatre. Beecher came on late to the project, and the first demo – The Taxidermist, in which Madison was voiced by Barbara Scaff – had already been made, before it was decided to recast the character. Beecher was contacted by her French agent in July 2008, after Quantic Dream had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> demo and requested her, and told to audition. The audition involved a cold reading of 5 or 6 different scenes with different endings. The developers considered having her do the body capture, but were concerned that it would not match the movements of the shorter Ainsley, and were not willing to redo all the motion capturing. Madison had 150 pages of scripted dialogue; due to the motion capture, the script could not be seen and thus had to be learnt, which took Beecher roughly a month.|$|E

500|$|... "Night of Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by Cristyle Johnson, Anthony Preston, David Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort, whilst {{production}} of the song was helmed by Guetta and Tuinfort. In an interview with Akshay Bhansali of MTV News, Guetta revealed {{that he did not}} know Hudson before collaborating on the song, saying, [...] "I had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> [...] and I fell in love with it. It's a difficult song. You need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She obviously has an amazing voice, and I think it was a really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy." [...] "Night of Your Life" [...] was released for digital download on August 22, 2011, as the third and final promotional single from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's release.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 1995, Selena {{contacted}} Leonard Wong {{about the}} perfume samples {{he had made}} for her. According to Wong, Selena told him she would be meeting Saldívar {{the next morning to}} pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. The same day, she told another employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. At 7:30a.m. (CST) Friday, March 31, Selena rose from her bed, donned green workout sweats, and left for Saldívar's motel room. At the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico. Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital, where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed [...] "clear symptoms of depression." [...] Saldívar told medical staff she had bled [...] "a little". The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery. At 10:00a.m. (CST), Quintanilla, Jr. contacted Pérez to determine the whereabouts of Selena; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. Pérez called Selena on her cellular telephone and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him she had forgotten the session and she was [...] "taking care of one last [...] business" [...] and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and was the last time Pérez <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Alaide {{is brought}} to trial before the {{assembled}} judges, but concealed beneath a heavy veil. Osburgo testifies against her. When asked her name by the presiding Prior, she responds only with La straniera. The Prior feels that he has <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> before, and he demands that she prove her innocence. She is reluctant to say much more. Suddenly, Arturo rushes in and proclaims her innocence and confesses his own guilt, stating that he killed someone whom he assumed was a rival. [...] All appears to doom both Alaide and Arturo when, into the chamber Valdeburgo suddenly appears, announcing that Arturo is innocent {{and that it was}} in single combat with Arturo that he fell into the lake.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob loved Rachel, {{and offered to}} serve Laban seven years for Rachel's hand, and Laban agreed. Jacob served the years, but his love for Rachel made them seem like just a few days. Jacob asked Laban for his wife, and Laban made a feast and invited all {{the men of the}} place. In the evening, Laban brought Leah to Jacob, and Jacob slept with her. Laban gave Leah Zilpah to be her handmaid. In the morning, Jacob {{discovered}} that it was Leah, and he complained to Laban that he had served for Rachel. Laban replied that in that place, they did not give the younger before the firstborn, but if Jacob fulfilled Leah's week, he would give Jacob both daughters in exchange for another seven years of service. Jacob did so, and Laban gave him Rachel to wife, and gave Rachel Bilhah to be her handmaid. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, so God allowed Leah to conceive, but Rachel was barren. Leah bore a son, and called him Reuben, saying that God had looked upon her affliction. She bore a second son, and called him Simeon, saying that God had heard that she was hated. She bore a third son, and called him Levi, saying that this time her husband would be joined to her. She bore a fourth son, and called him Judah, saying that this time, she would praise God. Rachel envied her sister, and demanded that Jacob give her children, but Jacob grew angry and asked her whether he was in God's stead, who had withheld children from her. Rachel told Jacob to sleep with her maid Bilhah, so that Bilhah might bear children upon Rachel's knees who might be credited to Rachel, and he did. Bilhah bore Jacob a son, and Rachel called him Dan, saying that God had judged her and also <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> And Bilhah bore Jacob a second son, and Rachel called him Naphtali, saying that she had wrestled with her sister and prevailed. When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she gave Jacob her maid Zilpah to wife. Zilpah bore Jacob a son, and Leah called him Gad, saying that fortune had come. And Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, and Leah called him Asher, saying that she was happy, for the daughters would call her happy. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

60|$|Ursula {{slipped past}} the woman. His door opened. He had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|Oh, nothing, nothing--a {{murmur of}} voices--and the woman's--I could swear I have <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> before.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time I <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> very slow and soft, almost languid, yet very {{pleasant}} to listen to.|$|E
60|$|As I {{dropped to}} sleep I <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> tender <b>voice</b> {{soothing}} like an infant the aged mother, who at last sank away into a long, irresistible slumber.|$|R
60|$|But {{the wind}} screeched and howled so madly that she scarce <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> own <b>voice,</b> {{and the man}} {{certainly}} failed to hear her, for he did not move.|$|R
60|$|Just at this moment, {{the boat}} {{stopped at a}} small landing-place to take in some wood. Eva <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>voice,</b> and ran away to speak to him.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as he}} <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> Harry {{jumped from}} the old man's knee, and running to her side, put up his arms.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hiding, are you? Brute! Come out, or I'll--by heavens, I'll {{shoot you}} if you don't tell me the truth. I <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> in the lane. I'll swear to it." ...|$|E

60|$|When Dorothea {{was again}} at Lydgate's door {{speaking}} to Martha, {{he was in}} the room close by with the door ajar, preparing to go out. He <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> and immediately came to her.|$|E

6000|$|When he ceased speaking, {{the girl}} came to {{herself with a}} catch of her breath. He <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> the varied charm of which he thought he knew so well, saying with an {{unfamiliar}} intonation: ...|$|E
