40|$|MBA Thesis 2014 ABSTRACT The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to identify the types of trade barriers that exist in the South African chemical industry, and to analyse the responses of companies in the industry to these barriers. While the aim was to interview 20 participants, {{the research}}er interviewed 23 participants. The criteria for selection were that each participant had to be working in the chemical industry, and have had some exposure to international and local trade. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. The researcher conducted the interviews personally. All the interviews were recorded. The participants all requested to remain anonymous. Most of the respondents were familiar with customs duty as a tariff barrier, whilst four could not answer the question. Regarding non-tariff barriers, Language and Logistics featured four times each, while four respondents were unfamiliar with non-tariff barriers. Some of the participants mentioned that their companies had to do something different in order to remain competitive in the light of trade barriers. This included reviewing their costing models, using transport more effectively, improving technical service, exploring new markets, rationalising their product lines and changing their product mix. Two of the respondents in a highly specialised industry mentioned {{that they do not have}} to do anything differently because if they provide the best solution then they will get the business and the barriers are irrelevant. Some of the respondents had engaged with the DTI to have barriers imposed, but mentioned that the process of engaging with the DTI was both time-consuming and costly. The incentives for export were not clearly defined by the DTI, and this was itself seen as a barrier. It was found that the Customs and Excise department was losing revenue due to the <b>incorrect</b> <b>declaration</b> of goods, where importers are avoiding the payment of the customs duty. Barriers were in place for strategic reasons, and if they are removed or reduced then companies could close, or people could be retrenched. Barriers were also seen to be good because they maintain standards within the industry...|$|E
40|$|Java Enterprise Applications (JEAs) {{are large}} systems that {{integrate}} multiple technologies and programming languages. Transactions in JEAs simplify {{the development of}} code that deals with failure recovery and multi-user coordination by guaranteeing atomicity of sets of operations. The heterogeneous nature of JEAs, however, can obfuscate conceptual errors in the application code, and in particular can hide <b>incorrect</b> <b>declarations</b> of transaction scope. In this paper we present a technique to expose and analyze the application transaction scope in JEAs by merging and analyzing information from multiple sources. We also present several novel visualizations that aid {{in the analysis of}} transaction scope by highlighting anomalies in the specification of transactions and violations of architectural constraints. We have validated our approach on two versions of a large commercial case study...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{misinterpretation}} of {{the results}} of multiple statistical tests is an error commonly made in scientific literature. When testing several outcome variables simultaneously, many researchers declare a statistically significant result for each test having a P value of 3 ̆c 0. 05, for example. This approach ignores the fact that, based on a probability result called the Bonferroni inequality, the risk of incorrectly declaring as significant ≥ 1 test result increases with the number of tests conducted. The implication of this practice is that many scientific results are presented as statistically significant when the underlying data do not adequately support such a claim (sometimes referred to as false-positive results). Although the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test is well known among statisticians, it is not used routinely in scientific literature. Objective: The intent of this article was to increase the awareness and understanding of the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test, thereby expanding its use. Methods: This article describes the statistical problem and demonstrates how the use of the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test ensures that <b>incorrect</b> <b>declarations</b> of statistical significance for ≥ 1 test result are bounded by 0. 05, for example. Conclusion: The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test is an easily applied, versatile statistical tool that enables researchers to make simultaneous inferences from their data without risking an unacceptably high overall type I error rate...|$|R

In 1982, a ministerial staffer submitted an <b>incorrect</b> excise customs <b>declaration</b> form when arranging for the set to be imported. When this was discovered, a fellow Minister, John Moore, attempted a cover-up. Moore and MacKellar both accepted responsibility and resigned as Ministers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new search model {{to deal with}} public sector {{decisions}} in which intangible factors {{need to be considered}} along with tangible ones. Such problems are often found {{in a wide range of}} administrative investigations and criminal inspections in Japan. In an effort to manage such problems, this article first constructs an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to deal with the intangible factors. Then, we reinforce the AHP model by incorporating tangible factors which are not included in tlte model. Tlte probit and/or logit models are applied to test the statistical significance of this combination, based on a past data set. This model can be considered as a two-stage procedure in the sense that the AHP results (the first stage) are utilized to construct a statistical model in the second stage, which aims at obtaining a better probability of detection. Although this study can foresee the probability of detection for individual objects based on this probability model, there is another important practical issue, i. e. the scheduling of associated officials. Therefore, this study proposes a scheduling model using mathematical programming methodology. Finally, the proposed model was applied to the investigation work of the Post-Clearance Audit Department of Japanese Customs. It was found that the probability of finding <b>incorrect</b> <b>declarations</b> would be improved from the current 60 % to 75 - 80 %. While our problem is not related to criminal activities directly, this study predicts that our approach might be applicable for other governmental investigations and inspections in the scope of this empirical study...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the breed}} of origin highly affects the beef price, {{reliable}} methods {{are needed to}} detect <b>incorrect</b> <b>declarations.</b> As most breeds are standardised for coat colour, the Melanocortin 1 Receptor gene (MC 1 R), involved in the regulation of eu/pheomelanins synthesis, has been suggested as marker for breed traceability of products of animal origin. The aim of this investigation is to characterise the main breeds reared in the Piedmont Region by MC 1 R locus and to apply {{the analysis of the}} locus to breed traceability of beef cuts purchased in different outlets of the Region. A total of 168 DNA samples of four cattle breeds (Piemontese, Blonde d’Aquitaine, Italian Friesian and Aosta Red Pied) were analysed for MC 1 R locus by PCR-RFLP. In addition, 28 DNA samples from beef with breed indication were tested. Piemontese and Blonde d’Aquitaine were monomorphic for the E+and eallele, respectively. In the Friesian breed the EdEd genotype was the most frequent, but Edewas also observed (2 %). Aosta Red Pied was the most variable breed, with the presence of the three alleles and five genotypes out of six. The comparison of the genotypic distribution in the four breeds clearly indicates {{that it is possible to}} distinguish among Piemontese, Blonde d’Aquitaine and Friesian breeds, but the same is not true for Aosta Red Pied, which has genotypes in common with the other breeds. The results on beef samples revealed a high percentage of mislabelling (about 18 %), which concerned Friesian breed and crossbreds. These results indicate that MC 1 R locus is an effective marker in breed traceability of beef, when the involved breeds are characterised by different genotypes. Moreover, compared to other genetic markers, it has the great advantage of not requiring DNA reference sam- ples. This survey, though limited, has revealed a high percentage of incompatibilities. Therefore, the analysis of MC 1 R locus is recommended in the framework of product certification, at least for random controls within a system aimed at preventing fraud...|$|R
40|$|Considering that seafood mislabeling {{has been}} widely {{reported}} throughout {{the world and that}} the authentication of food components {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this study was to use DNA barcoding to investigate the prevalence of mislabeling among fish fillet products from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (SE Italy). The study reveals a high degree of species mislabeling in fish fillet products. In particular, this study shows that the labels of only 32 / 200 fish fillet samples provided comprehensive information relating to commercial designation, scientific name, geographical area, production method and whether previously frozen. The labeling of other samples was not compliant with European legislation. Indeed, the scientific name, which must also be indicated from 1 st January 2012, according to Article 68 of EU Commission Implementing Regulation No. 404 / 2011, was missing in 157 / 168 samples, the geographical area was missing in 152 / 168, while the commercial designation and the production method were reported in all samples. Furthermore, results from molecular investigations reveal a high occurrence of <b>incorrect</b> species <b>declaration</b> in fish fillet products. The commercial and/or scientific name declared failed to match the species identified in 164 / 200 (82 %) samples. The study also highlighted that threatened, Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR) species considered to be facing a high risk of extinction has been used in the place of commercial species. This study thus provides further evidence of the need for increased traceability and assessment of food product authenticity. Additionally, traceability may improve the management of hazards related to fish safety, as well as guaranteeing product authenticity, providing reliable information to customers, enhancing supply-side management and improving product quality and sustainability...|$|R
