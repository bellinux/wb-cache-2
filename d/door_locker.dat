50|$|<b>Locker</b> <b>doors</b> {{usually have}} door {{stiffeners}} fixed vertically {{to the inside}} of the door, in the form of a metal plate welded to the inner surface, and protruding outward a fraction of an inch, thus adding to the robustness of the door and making it harder to force open.|$|R
500|$|Philip K. Wrigley had {{employee}} Bill Veeck, Jr. add ivy to {{the outfield}} walls of Wrigley Field in September 1937. Wrigley Field {{is the home}} stadium for the Chicago Cubs, and its wall {{is well known for}} being covered in ivy except for a few select places where signs are present as well as <b>doors</b> to <b>locker</b> rooms and such.

50|$|Externally, {{a notable}} {{feature of the}} 404 and 405 was the {{abandonment}} of the BMW-style radiator grille for one much more like an aero-engine. The 405, although the only four-door car ever built by Bristol, had styling {{that the company was}} later to refine for many years on their later Chrysler V8-engined cars during the 1960s. It was also the model that introduced the Bristol feature of sizable lockers in the front wings accessed externally by gullwing <b>doors.</b> The <b>locker</b> on the nearside held the spare wheel and jack, whilst that on the offside housed the battery and fuse panel.|$|R

50|$|<b>Locker</b> <b>doors</b> {{usually have}} some kind of {{ventilation}} to provide for the flow of air to aid in cleanliness. These vents usually {{take the form of a}} series of horizontal angled slats at the top and bottom of the door, although sometimes parallel rows of small square or rectangular holes are found instead, running up and down the door. Less often, the side or rear walls may also have similar ventilation.|$|R
50|$|Other {{advocates of}} lockerless schools also cite reasons such as {{reducing}} noise {{by eliminating the}} clang of dozens of <b>locker</b> <b>doors,</b> or creating a more appealing environment aesthetically.

5000|$|A popular {{feature is}} a [...] "Portuguese bridge", which {{consists}} of a walkway behind the foredeck, in front and to the sides of, the pilothouse windows, separated from the foredeck by a (generally) waist-high bulwark. The purpose of the bridge is to deflect green water from the foredeck up over the superstructure top rather than slamming against the forward windows of the pilothouse. It gives a semi-sheltered area outside the pilothouse while underway. A secondary benefit is that it provides a [...] "safe area" [...] or handhold when {{it is necessary to}} be on the foredeck in inclement weather. And lastly, it provides additional storage space for lines, fire extinguisher, spare anchor, drogue, etc., if the builder has provided access <b>doors</b> and <b>lockers</b> {{on the inside of the}} bridge.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, a $4 {{million bond}} issue was passed to fund {{improvements}} to the {{middle school and high}} school facilities.

An addition was built that houses a new main office, principal's office, teacher workroom, and freight room. By renovating existing space, three additional classrooms and a conference room were added to the middle school.|$|R
50|$|Engine House No. 7 at 931 R Street N.W. {{remained}} a working firehouse with Engine Co. No. 4, until the October 1976 when budgetary and other practical considerations during {{the tenure of}} Mayor Walter Washington forced the reorganization of the District Fire Department yet again, moving Engine Co. No. 4 to a new building at 2531 Sherman Avenue, N.W. The city fire department’s loss, however, became the art community’s gain. Engine House No. 7 was purchased under the District’s surplus property disposal program by harpsichord makers Tom and Barbara Wolfe. The Wolfes manufactured harpsichords there until the summer of 1992, when District of Columbia artist Craig Kraft and Adrienne Beck purchased the building and renovated the lower level to become a studio. Today, many of the original architectural elements of the building remain, including the brick façade, double <b>doors,</b> clothing <b>lockers,</b> and switchboard.|$|R

5000|$|Number of locking points: <b>Locker</b> <b>doors</b> may lock {{with either}} single- or three-point locking, {{but this is}} not {{normally}} chosen as a separate option, and the choice is usually dependent on the number of tiers in the lockers, or whether they are a high-security model, although some manufacturers do allow purchasers to specifically choose an option here that goes against their normal practice. Single-point locking locks the door at only the point where the latch engages with the door-frame, whereas three-point locking uses extensible steel rods to lock {{the top and bottom of}} the door as well.|$|R
60|$|That made Harvey almost weep, {{though he}} could not tell why. But it was much worse when the cook dropped the {{potatoes}} {{and held out his}} hands for the fiddle. Still leaning against the <b>locker</b> <b>door,</b> he struck into a tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you did. After a little he sang in an unknown tongue, his big chin down on the fiddle-tail, his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight. Harvey swung out of his bunk to hear better; and amid the straining of the timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on, like lee surf in a blind fog, till it ended with a wail.|$|R
50|$|Not {{far from}} port, Fletcher ordered a test-firing of Margarets guns; the forward gun's backrush {{blew out the}} {{forecastle}} <b>locker</b> <b>door</b> and the after gun blew out the stern rail and opened additional leaks; Fletcher then ordered the gunnery officer never to fire the guns again. A storm struck {{on the first night}} at sea, rendering all but two of the men on board Margaret too seasick to carry out their duties, exaggerating the ship's leaks, and causing the condenser and steering gear to fail; as a result, the ship had to be steered manually with ropes attached to her tiller and there was a shortage of potable water that forced Fletcher to ration water strictly.|$|R

50|$|Both {{the comic}} and {{film version of}} Johann can leave their {{containment}} suit at will, though it is uncertain how long he can do so without dissipating; once freed from his suit, his ectoplasmic form can physically manipulate objects (as demonstrated when he gives Hellboy a sound thrashing in the B.P.R.D. locker room {{with a set of}} <b>locker</b> <b>doors),</b> or can be used for teleplasty (from the Greek τηλε (far)+ πλαστειν (to mold or form); the word ectoplasm derives from the same root), enabling him to temporarily reanimate dead creatures and possess mechanical objects or living things. He uses this talent to great effect near the film's climax, when he takes over one of the Golden Army's soldiers and uses it to fight the others.|$|R

5000|$|The {{focus of}} the {{experience}} is on improvised melee, allowing players and enemies to collect, or even pull, weapons from their surrounding environments, such as pipes, <b>locker</b> <b>doors,</b> shovels, and 2x4s. The word often employed by the developers of the game to describe the combat is 'visceral'. A quick-kick is available for attacking without, or alongside, a hand-held weapon, and attacks can be unleashed in different directions and configurations, such as left to right or overhead, but combat is notable for not utilizing a combo system, unlike similar titles such as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay.
