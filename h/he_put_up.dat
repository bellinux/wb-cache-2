25|$|In March 1869 James Hall, {{master of}} the steamer Herald, appeared, on summons, charged with a breach of the Steam Navigation Act, by taking in tow the barque Mary Miller without exhibiting two {{masthead}} lights.

Henry Hall, engineer of the Herald, deposed that ongoing alongside the barque the Herald had the usual steamers' lights up, but before getting underway the captain gave orders to hoist the additional masthead light. William Murdon, coxswain of the Herald, deposed that on making fast to the barque for the purpose of towing her <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> two masthead lights and the usual side lights.
