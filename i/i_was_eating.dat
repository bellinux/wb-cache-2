500|$|In exile {{after more}} than 30 years of coaching, Brown spent {{the next five years}} away from the sidelines, never once {{attending}} a Browns contest. While he was secure financially, Brown's frustration grew with each passing year. [...] "It was terrible", he later recalled. [...] "I had everything a man could want: leisure, enough money, a wonderful family. Yet with all that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> my heart out." [...] Because Brown was still receiving his annual salary and liked to golf, it was said that the only two people who made more money playing golf were Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.|$|E
