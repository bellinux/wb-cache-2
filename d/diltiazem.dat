5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, <b>diltiazem,</b> {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Class IV agents include {{verapamil}} and <b>diltiazem.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Diltiazem</b> {{has been}} shown to be more {{effective}} than either digoxin or amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} have taken {{too much of a}} calcium channel blocker, {{especially}} <b>diltiazem,</b> get slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the dihydropyridine group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure. For verapamil, despite it having a similar mechanism of action as <b>diltiazem,</b> both fast and slow heart rhythm are described.|$|E
25|$|Non-surgical {{treatments}} are recommended initially for acute and chronic anal fissures. These include topical nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers (e.g. <b>diltiazem),</b> or injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|AV node {{blockers}} {{should be}} avoided in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with WPW or history of it; this includes adenosine, <b>diltiazem,</b> verapamil, other calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. They can exacerbate the syndrome by blocking the heart's normal electrical pathway (therefore favoring 1:1 atrial to ventricle conduction through the pre-excitation pathway, potentially leading to unstable ventricular arrhythmias).|$|E
25|$|Simvastatin is {{contraindicated}} with pregnancy, breastfeeding, {{and liver}} disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on simvastatin due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on simvastatin due to potentially disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism. High doses of simvastatin are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive amlodipine. A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and <b>diltiazem,</b> {{as well as}} those taking amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|When an {{application}} is approved, the FDA adds the generic drug to its Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list and annotates {{the list to}} show equivalence between the reference-listed drug and the generic. The FDA also recognizes drugs that use the same ingredients with different bioavailability, and divides them into therapeutic equivalence groups. For example, as of 2006, <b>diltiazem</b> hydrochloride had four equivalence groups, all using the same active ingredient, but considered equivalent only within each group.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or <b>diltiazem)</b> by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} for mild cases is simply reassurance and topical treatment with calcium-channel blocker (<b>diltiazem,</b> nifedipine) ointment, salbutamol inhalation and sublingual nitroglycerine.For persistent cases, local anesthetic blocks, clonidine or Botox injections can be considered. Supportive treatments directed at aggravating factors include high-fiber diet, withdrawal of drugs which have gut effects (e.g., drugs that provoke or worsen constipation including narcotics and oral calcium channel blockers; drugs that provoke or worsen diarrhea including quinidine, theophylline, and antibiotics), warm baths, rectal massage, perineal strengthening exercises, anti-cholinergic agents, non-narcotic analgesics, sedatives or muscle relaxants such as diazepam.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250mg and up to 300mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death {{has been reported in}} association with 450mg buspirone together with alprazolam, <b>diltiazem,</b> alcohol, cocaine.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as <b>diltiazem,</b> erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E

2500|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} {{can be used}} in {{the treatment}} of aortic dissection, particularly if a contraindication to the use of beta blockers exists. [...] The calcium channel blockers typically used are verapamil and <b>diltiazem,</b> because of their combined vasodilator and negative inotropic effects.|$|E
2500|$|Branded {{preparations}} are {{now available}} of topical nitroglycerine ointment (Rectogesic (Rectiv) as 0.2% in Australia and 0.4% in UK and US), topical nifedipine 0.3% with lidocaine 1.5% ointment (Antrolin in Italy since April 2004) and <b>diltiazem</b> 2% (Anoheal in UK, although still in Phase III development). [...] A common side effect drawback of nitroglycerine ointment is headache, caused by systemic absorption of the drug, which limits patient acceptability.|$|E
2500|$|... primary sex headache: dull, {{bilateral}} headache {{that starts}} during sexual activity and becomes much worse during orgasm. These headaches {{are thought to}} be due to lower pressure in the head during sex. It is important to realize that headaches that begin during orgasm may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, so serious causes must be ruled out first. These headaches are treated by advising the person to stop sex if they develop a headache. Medications such as propranolol and <b>diltiazem</b> can also be helpful.|$|E
2500|$|Ketoconazole and Itraconazole have a {{profound}} effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia and renal failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, <b>diltiazem,</b> erythromycin, [...] fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, [...] rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on Atripla.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{therapy for}} {{nutcracker}} esophagus includes {{the use of}} calcium-channel blockers, which relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and palliate the dysphagia symptoms. [...] <b>Diltiazem,</b> a calcium-channel blocker, {{has been used in}} randomized control studies with good effect. [...] Nitrate medications, including isosorbide dinitrate, given before meals, may also help relax the LES and improve symptoms. [...] The inexpensive generic combination of belladonna and phenobarbital (Donnatal and other brands) may be taken three times daily as a tablet to prevent attacks or, for patients with only occasional episodes, as an elixir at the onset of symptoms. [...] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil, can be given to reduce symptoms, particularly pain, but small trials {{have not been able to}} demonstrate clinical improvement. [...] Finally, trazodone, an antidepressant that reduces visceral sensitivity, has also been shown to reduce chest pain symptoms in patients with nutcracker esophagus.|$|E
