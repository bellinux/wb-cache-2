5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to <b>give</b> <b>some</b> copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|Gundamma is {{tortured}} by Padma's ruthless, confidence-trickster aunt Durga. Bhoopati is {{released from jail}} and Ghantaiah asks Gundamma to <b>give</b> <b>some</b> money. Because of Gundamma's arrogance, Prabhakar and Padma leave for Bangalore. Durga steals {{the money in the}} locker, accuses Gundamma of robbery and locks her in a room behind the house. Lakshmi and Anji visit Gundamma and become aware of her condition. Lakshmi and Gundamma coerce Durga and retrieve the money she stole. Bhoopati comes to Durga's rescue but is defeated by Anji in a duel and is hospitalised.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Caligula's reign is {{extremely}} problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived — {{the works of}} Philo and Seneca. Philo's works, On the Embassy to Gaius and Flaccus, <b>give</b> <b>some</b> details on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in AD 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.|$|E
5|$|The next day, many {{survivors}} in the island's camp are stressed, including Sullivan (Scott Paulin), who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{and his new}} hunting companion, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), <b>give</b> <b>some</b> newly found luggage to Hurley; he looks through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including Kate and Sawyer, arrive to participate.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to the thin air at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to <b>give</b> <b>some</b> protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
