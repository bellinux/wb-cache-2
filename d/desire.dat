Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.|$|E

50|$|Whereas the optative expresses hopes, the desiderative mood expresses {{wishes and}} <b>desires.</b> <b>Desires</b> {{are what we}} want to be the case; hope {{generally}} implies optimism toward the chances of a <b>desire's</b> fulfillment. If someone <b>desires</b> something but is pessimistic about its chances of occurring, then one <b>desires</b> it but does not hope for it. Few languages have a distinct desiderative mood; two that do are Sanskrit and Japanese.|$|R

When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his <b>desire</b> for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his <b>desire</b> to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his <b>desire.</b> He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
40|$|Conditioning {{can produce}} <b>desires</b> {{that seem to}} be outside of [...] or “alien” to [...] the agent. Desire-based {{theories}} of welfare claim that the satisfaction of <b>desires</b> creates prudential value. But the satisfaction of alien <b>desires</b> does not seem to create prudential value. To explain this fact, we need an account of alien <b>desires</b> that explains their moral status. In this paper I suggest that alien <b>desires</b> are <b>desires</b> that would be rational if the person believed something that in fact she believes is false. Such <b>desires</b> could be produced by mental representations [...] or “quasi-beliefs” [...] with contents that conflict with the contents of one’s beliefs. The postulation of quasi-beliefs is plausible, for they explain important empirical facts about our behavior [...] facts that are difficult if not impossible to explain otherwise. Alien <b>desires,</b> I argue, involve quasi-beliefs with contents that conflict with the contents of regular beliefs. This theory provides the distinction between alien and authentic <b>desires</b> that desire-based theories of welfare need...|$|R

40|$|Logics of <b>desires,</b> {{preferences}} and goals {{have recently been}} proposed in planning and agent theory. In this paper we use a dynamic logic with utilitarian goals and <b>desires</b> to discuss the relation between goals, <b>desires</b> and utilities. From a static point of view goals are de ned using <b>desires</b> and beliefs, and <b>desires</b> are de ned using the utility function and a context. The consequences for the dynamics are that utilities are the most stable, then <b>desires,</b> and goals change most often. We illustrate {{the use of the}} logic to formalize certain aspects of negotiation. In particular, we show how one agent can inuence the behavior of another agent by inuencing his <b>desires...</b>|$|R

40|$|Autonomous agents reason {{frequently}} about preferences such as <b>desires</b> and goals. In {{this paper}} we propose a logic of <b>desires</b> with a utilitarian semantics, in which we study non-monotonic reasoning about <b>desires</b> and preferences {{based on the idea that}} <b>desires</b> can be understood in terms of utility losses (penalties for violations) and utility gains (rewards for fulfillments). Our logic allows for a systematic study and classification of <b>desires,</b> for example by distinguishing subtly different ways to add up these utility losses and gains. We propose an explicit construction of the agent's preference relation from a set of <b>desires</b> together with different kinds of knowledge. A set of <b>desires</b> extended with knowledge induces a set of `distinguished' utility functions by adding up the utility losses and gains of the individual <b>desires,</b> and these distinguished utility functions induce the preference relation...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether <b>desired</b> personality influences face preference. Pairs of composite faces were made {{based on the}} faces that individuals differing in <b>desired</b> partner personality found most attractive. One composite represented a face most attractive to those <b>desiring</b> a particular trait {{and the other a}} face most attractive to those not <b>desiring</b> the same trait. Pairs were presented to different participants to ascertain whether the composites reflected the <b>desired</b> personality of the original raters. For several traits the composites did differ in perceived personality indicating that the personality <b>desired</b> in a partner is reflected in face preference: if a trait is <b>desired</b> then faces perceived to possess that trait are found more attractive than faces which do not possess that trait. These findings cast new light on the "what is beautiful is good" stereotype. What an individual <b>desires</b> in partner reflects what they consider "good", and they find faces reflecting these <b>desired</b> traits as attractive - "what is good is beautiful". Possessing personality traits that are attractive may be causal in making a face attractive. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
