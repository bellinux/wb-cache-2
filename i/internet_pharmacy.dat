40|$|In {{this article}} I {{will argue that}} <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> pose a {{significant}} public health problem, as they raise the classic eternal triangle of health care issues [...] access, quality, and financing [...] in a new technological context. Part II describes the phenomena of <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> and Part III reviews the present regulatory scheme. Part IV explains why the current legal framework is inadequate to address the {{public health and safety}} problems posed by <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> focusing particularly on the jurisdictional, constitutional, and practical obstacles to effective state oversight of <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Part V argues that comprehensive federal oversight of Internet prescribing and dispensing is necessary to protect individual and public health, and outlines the essential elements of such an approach...|$|R
40|$|<b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> are an {{economic}} and communications miracle [...] and a regulatory nightmare. It is estimated that Americans spent some $ 3. 2 billion in 2003 on medications from the <b>Internet,</b> but <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> permit consumers to evade long-standing regulatory protections, particularly those that rely on the oversight of drug prescribing and dispensing by licensed physicians and pharmacists...|$|R

5000|$|As {{of early}} 2013, several domain name registrars {{explicitly}} state in their terms {{of services that}} they suspend and lock domain names identified as rogue Internet pharmacies by LegitScript, and outsource their abuse point-of-contact on <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacy</b> issues to LegitScript. The company has stated that it works with most domain name registrars, and, in late 2012, it began publishing data showing that the websites of rogue Internet pharmacies [...] "cluster" [...] around {{a small number of}} registrars that LegitScript says ignore abuse notifications. Several <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacy</b> affiliate marketers have publicly discussed the importance of registering <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacy</b> domain names with registrars that do not work with LegitScript. In submitting abuse notifications to ICANN-accredited registrars, LegitScript has authority to act on the behalf of government regulators in some countries, such as Japan.|$|E

25|$|Canada is home {{to dozens}} of {{licensed}} <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers, who pay one of the world's highest drug prices.

2500|$|While most <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> sell {{prescription}} drugs and require a valid prescription, some <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> sell {{prescription drugs}} without requiring a prescription. [...] Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the [...] "inconvenience" [...] of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} growing {{phenomenon}} of selling drugs and medical services over the Inter-net via <b>Internet</b> <b>Pharmacies.</b> It discusses {{some of the}} benefits of <b>Internet</b> <b>Pharmacies</b> and some serious concerns that they bring for regulators, governments and global consumers. In addition, the paper compares regulatory frameworks governing the operation of <b>Internet</b> <b>Pharmacies</b> in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the United States (“US”), to illustrate some of the challenges related to differences. Some of these comparisons relate to regulatory structure, advertising of prescription drugs, online prescribing, data protection, policy on importing drugs for personal use and self-regulation/certification of web-sites. In assessing reasons for differences in the two jurisdictions, the paper concludes that these are due to various historic, economic, geographic and political factors. The paper argues that continuing regulatory challenges arise {{due to the nature of}} the Inter-net, jurisdiction issues, economic realities, and a lack of harmonisation of regulatory policy at an interna-tional/global level. The paper further argues that a global approach is needed to regulate online medical services, because of the potential threat to the health and well-being of the global community...|$|R

50|$|The first <b>internet</b> <b>pharmacy</b> in the UK was Pharmacy2U, {{which started}} {{operating}} in 1999. The UK is a frontline leader in <b>internet</b> <b>pharmacy</b> since a change to NHS pharmacy regulations in 2005 {{that made it}} legal for pharmacies to fill NHS prescriptions over the internet. Drugs supplied in this way tend to be medicines which doctors refuse to prescribe for patients, or would charge a private prescription fee, as all patients treated under the National Health Service pay either a flat price or nothing for prescribed medicine (except for medicine classed as lifestyle medicine, e.g. anti-malarials for travel), and medical equipment. Since July 2015 the Medicines and Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has required online sellers of medicines to adopt an EU wide logo and maintain an entry in the MHRA medicines sellers registry.|$|E

The report resulted in the termination of large underground steroids rings and controversy on pro-steroids forums. LegitScript also released two reports analyzing Microsoft and Yahoo sponsored search results for <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Subsequently, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft announced that they were updating their advertising policies related to <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> and would in the future require that <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> be approved by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's VIPPS program. Shortly thereafter, LegitScript announced that it would be helping Google implement the new policy by monitoring all prescription drug and pharmacy ads for the search engine. LegitScript states that it performs Google monitoring throughout North America, the EU, Russia and Asia for Google ads, and also identifies Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as clients.|$|R
50|$|Since {{about the}} year 2000, {{a growing number of}} <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> have been {{established}} worldwide. Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door. The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{verification}} {{programs for}} online pharmacies that are {{recognized by the}} National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). One is VIPPS, which is operated by the NABP and was created in 1999. The Food and Drug Administration refers Internet users interested in using an online pharmacy to the VIPPS program. The other is LegitScript, which as of September 2010 had approved over 340 <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> as legitimate and identified over 47,000 [...] "rogue" [...] <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Canadian and all non-U.S. online pharmacies that sell prescription medication to Americans, regardless of credentials, {{are not eligible for}} approval in the VIPPS and LegitScript programs.|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{developments}} in {{information and communication}} technologies (ICT) have resulted in the widespread use of the Internet as an important medium for commercial activity. Such activity commonly referred to as electronic commerce, or e-commerce has facilitated new business models in many different commercial endeavours including pharmaceutical and medical practice. This paper investigates the growing phenomenon of drugs sales and medical services over the <b>Internet</b> via <b>Internet</b> <b>Pharmacies.</b> Although <b>Internet</b> <b>Pharmacies</b> have resulted in many benefits to consumers, there are serious health and safety concerns about various aspects of this commercial activity, especially where laws and regulations are not adhered to. Such concerns raise important issues regarding social accountability when using ICT to facilitate the provision of medical services. The paper examines the benefits and problems associated with <b>Internet</b> <b>pharmacies</b> with a view to discussing some of the challenges faced especially by legislators and regulators. It argues that many of these challenges are compounded {{by the nature of the}} Internet itself, social and economic realities, different national regulatory structures and the difficulty of enforcing national laws outside of legal jurisdictions.
