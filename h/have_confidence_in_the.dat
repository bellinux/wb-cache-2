Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself.

Critics of the government such as Joe Clark then pointed out that in the previous week, the Globe & Mail had run on its front page a photo of Canadian soldiers turning over POWs to American troops. Eggleton maintained that he {{and the rest of the}} Cabinet been kept unaware that the Canadian Forces were taking POWs in Afghanistan and turning them to the Americans, claiming that he had only learned of the policy of handing over POWs several days after the photo had appeared in the Globe. When pressed by opposition critics about his apparent ignorance of what was Canada's policy on turning over POWs captured in Afghanistan, Eggleton then claimed that he had not only forgotten that he had been briefed by senior bureaucrats that Canadian forces were to hand over POWs to the Americans, but that he had also forgotten to inform the Cabinet. When pressed by the opposition critics to fire Eggleton under the grounds that the Minister of Defence was either lying to Parliament or, if his story was true, that someone so forgetful should not be directing the Defence Department in the midst of a war, Chrétien informed the House of Commons that: [...] "Myself, cabinet and the Liberal Party <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abilities and dedication of the Minister of National Defence", and that Eggleton would stay on.|$|E
