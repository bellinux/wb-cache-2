25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, several {{manufacturers}} {{were prepared to}} introduce read/write digital audio formats to the United States. These new formats were a significant improvement over the newly introduced read-only digital format of the compact disc, allowing consumers to make perfect, multi-generation copies of digital audio recordings. Most prominent among these formats was <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape</b> (<b>DAT),</b> followed in the early 1990s by Philips' Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) and Sony's Minidisc.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{efficiency}} of encoders is typically {{defined by the}} bit rate, because compression ratio depends on the bit depth and sampling rate of the input signal. Nevertheless, compression ratios are often published. They may use the Compact Disc (CD) parameters as references (44.1 kHz, 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2×16 bit), or sometimes the <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape</b> (<b>DAT)</b> SP parameters (48kHz, 2×16 bit). Compression ratios with this latter reference are higher, which demonstrates the problem with {{use of the term}} compression ratio for lossy encoders.|$|E
500|$|From 1995, Jansch {{appeared}} frequently at the 12 Bar Club in Denmark Street, London. One of his live sets {{there was}} recorded direct to <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape</b> (<b>DAT)</b> by Jansch's then manager, Alan King, {{and was released}} as the Live at the 12 Bar: an official bootleg album in 1996. In 2002 Jansch, Bernard Butler and Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Hodge performed live together at the Jazz Cafe, London. Bernard Butler had also appeared on Bert's 2002 album Edge of a Dream featuring, among others, Ralph McTell and guitarist Paul Wassif. The instrumental [...] "Black Cat Blues," [...] featuring Paul Wassif, appeared on the 2003 film Calendar Girls, and Wassif became a frequent sideman at Bert's live shows. In 2003, Jansch celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. The BBC organised a concert for Jansch and various guests at the church of St Luke Old Street, which was televised on BBC Four.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape</b> (or <b>DAT)</b> is {{the most}} well-known, and had some success as an audio storage format among {{professionals}} and [...] "prosumers" [...] before the prices of hard drive and solid-state flash memory-based digital recording devices dropped in the late 1990s. Hard-drive recording has mostly made DAT obsolete, as hard disk recorders offer more editing versatility than tape, and easier importation into <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> workstations (DAWs) and non-linear video editing (NLE) systems.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{a number}} of {{short-lived}} [...] "hybrid" [...] studio and consumer technologies appeared in this period (e.g. <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape</b> or <b>DAT,</b> which recorded digital signal samples onto standard magnetic tape), Sony assured the preeminence of its new digital recording system by introducing, together with Philips, the most advanced consumer audio format to date — the digital compact disc (CD). The Compact disc rapidly replaced both the 12" [...] album and the 7" [...] single as the new standard consumer format, and ushered {{in a new era}} of high-fidelity consumer audio — CDs were small, portable and durable, and they could reproduce the entire audible sound spectrum, with unrestricted dynamic range, perfect clarity and no distortion. Because CDs were encoded and read optically, using a laser beam, there was no physical contact between the disc and the playback mechanism, so a well-cared-for CD could be played over and over, with absolutely no degradation or loss of fidelity. CDs also represented a considerable advance in both the physical size of the medium, and its storage capacity — LPs could only practically hold about 50 minutes of audio, because they were physically limited {{by the size of the}} disc itself and the density of the grooves that could be cut into it — the longer the recording, the closer together the grooves and thus the lower the overall fidelity; CDs, on the other hand they were less than half the overall size of the old 12" [...] LP format, but offered about double the duration of the average LP, with up to 80 minutes of audio.|$|R
50|$|Formats like ProDigi and DASH were {{referred}} to as SDAT (Stationary-head <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape)</b> formats, as opposed to formats like the PCM adaptor-based systems and DAT, which {{were referred}} to as RDAT (Rotating-head <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Tape)</b> formats, due to their helical-scan process of recording.|$|R
500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> (<b>DAT)</b> to Madonna, and [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was among these tracks. It {{is based on the}} track [...] "Sepheryn" [...] (1971), by English folk music duo Curtiss Maldoon (consisting of Dave Curtiss and Clive Maldoon). In 1996, English singer and songwriter Christine Leach, Maldoon's niece, had recorded her version of the track. Leach said she had always loved the duo's work and [...] "Sepheryn" [...] was her favorite. She worked for a time with Orbit and recorded a demo of [...] "Sepheryn" [...] over a melody on which he was working. Leach rewrote the chorus and also removed a few bits from the original composition. Orbit included it in the DAT thinking that Leach had written the song. After Madonna heard the demo she liked it, and reworked the lyrics to create [...] "Ray of Light".|$|E
500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> (<b>DAT)</b> to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E
500|$|... "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", {{the first}} song on the album, was written and {{produced}} by Madonna and Orbit, with additional writers including Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins. The singer's manager Guy Oseary had telephoned and asked Orbit for collaborating on the album. Orbit sent a 13-track <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> (<b>DAT)</b> to Madonna, which included a demo version of the track. According to Madonna, {{she had been a}} fan of Orbit's work {{for a long time and}} was pleased with the demo. The song includes a sample from the song [...] "Why I Follow the Tigers" [...] by the San Sebastian Strings, a group created by both Kerr and McKuen. The vocal sample was of a man uttering the words [...] "you see", later confirmed by him to be actor Jesse Pearson. Both McKuen and Kerr received co-writing credits on [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] due to the inclusion of the sample, and also because thematically the track follows a plotline that transpired in [...] "Why I Follow the Tigers". Madonna was a great admirer of Collins' interior designing and had commissioned for designing a friend's night club located in Miami. He later ended up as one of the writers on the song.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and American {{producer}} and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom {{she gave birth to}} in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. [...] "That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including [...] "Nothing Really Matters". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> (<b>DAT)</b> to her, which included a demo version of [...] "Nothing Really Matters"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work {{for a long time and}} was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.|$|E
