In order to better understand the geochemical controls on the mobility of arsenic in a heavily arsenic-affected aquifer in northern Kandal Province, Cambodia, key changes in <b>inorganic</b> aqueous <b>geochemistry</b> have been monitored at high vertical and lateral resolution along dominant groundwater flow paths along two distinct transects. The two transects are characterized by differing geochemical, hydrological and lithological conditions. Arsenic concentrations in groundwater are highly heterogenous, and are broadly positively associated with iron and negatively associated with sulfate and dissolved oxygen. The observed correlations are generally consistent with arsenic mobilization by reductive-dissolution of iron (hydr) oxides. Key redox zones, as identified using groupings of the PHREEQC model equilibrium electron activity of major redox couples (notably ammonium/nitrite; ammonium/nitrate; nitrite/nitrate; dissolved oxygen/water) have been identified and vary with depth, site and season. Mineral saturation is also characterized. Seasonal changes in groundwater chemistry were observed in areas which were (i) sandy and of high permeability; (ii) in close proximity to rivers; and/or (iii) in close proximity to ponds. Such changes are attributed to monsoonal-driven surface-groundwater interactions and are consistent with the separate provenance of recharge sources as identified using stable isotope mixing models...|$|R

40|$|Elevated arsenic {{concentrations}} were detected in groundwater monitoring wells and a test well boring beneath the western {{portion of the}} Livermore Valley Basin in Pleasanton, California during regular sampling events in 1997. The source of the arsenic was not known, but was suspected from saturated sediments surrounding the wells. Arsenic species arsenite, As (III), has greater toxicity and mobility than arsenate, As (V). The prevalent arsenic species within the sediment and/or groundwater was not known. Forty two soil samples were collected at approximately 50 foot intervals from two wells/borings reporting elevated arsenic concentrations (HOP- 8 and HOP- 9) and from two control wells in which arsenic was not detected (TH- 9 and TH- 11). The soil samples were sieved and representative portions of the silt and clay fractions were analyzed for particle size using a laser particle size analyzer (LPSA). Sieve and LPSA results of the soil samples revealed semi-confining to confining layers at depth within HOP- 8, and HOP- 9, but not within TH- 9 or TH-ll. Laboratory analysis of the 42 soil samples reported elevated arsenic concentrations (up to 15 mg/kg) within soil samples collected from HOP- 8 at 400 to 500 ft below ground surface (bgs). Groundwater geochemical data was available for HOP- 8 and computer analysis of the <b>inorganic</b> water <b>geochemistry</b> using WATEVAL estimated pE values between 5 and 10, which were easily converted to Eh values between 0. 3 V and 0. 5 V. These values were plotted on Eh-pH diagrams, from which {{it was concluded that}} the arsenic species within the soil and groundwater was predominately arsenate, As (V). Based on the findings of this study, groundwater within semi-confined to confined aquifer zones under mildly reducing, anaerobic methanogenic conditions is most likely responsible for releasing adsorbed arsenic within iron oxides into groundwater solution. Elevated arsenic levels detected within the subsurface soil samples, mean grain size analysis, low concentrations of dissolved sulfate and dissolved iron coupled with estimated pE values, validate these findings. Although arsenate, As (V) was determined as be the dominating arsenic species within soil and groundwater samples collected at 450 ft within HOP- 8, the soil samples used for this study were exposed to the atmosphere during storage at Zone 7. It is possible that the dominate arsenic species in groundwater in HOP- 8 from 400 to 500 ft may be arsenite, As (III) since the soil and groundwater samples were exposed to the atmosphere during sampling and storage...|$|R

Anomalously high radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Srostracod values (max. 0. 70945) during BSWP-II- 2 suggest a potential Himalayan source communicated via the Caspian Sea. The T II warming started at 129. 9 ± 0. 7 ka BP 129. 9 ± 0. 7 ka BP, witnessed by abrupt disappearance of IRD, increasing δ 18 Oostracod values, and a first TEX 86 derived temperature rise of about 2. 5 [*]°C. A second, abrupt warming step to ca. 15. 5 [*]°C as the prelude of the Eemian warm period is documented at 128. 3 ka BP.

40|$|The {{nature and}} extent of {{environmental}} change over the Late Quaternary in Central Mexico is still uncertain. This study addresses the problem through an investigation of subfossil diatom assemblages in lacustrine sediments. As some doubt has been cast upon the reality of climatic change in Mexico, the variations in climate experienced over the archaeological and historical periods are described and possible explanations put forward in terms of the mechanisms of the present-day climate. The choice of technique and background to the region of the Neovolcanic Axis (Central Mexico) are outlined. As little is known of the modern aquatic environment of Central Mexico, a limnological survey was undertaken. The results of the analyses are discussed and possible trends of chemical evolution described. The modern diatom flora is presented for three areas and the results analysed using multivariate statistical techniques (TWINSPAN and DECORANA). These techniques highlight the importance of habitat in determining diatom assemblages. Subfossil diatom sequences are described from the Zacapu Basin, MichoacÃ¡n (covering the last 28, 000 years) and from the Upper Lerma Basin, Estado de MÃ©xico (covering about the last 11, 600 years). Additional palaeoenvironmental information is provided by analyses of <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>geochemistry.</b> In Central Mexico, wetter conditions probably prevailed prior to 25, 000 (possibly 28, 000) yr BP. In the Holocene, a dry event occurred between 7, 500 and 7, 000 yr BP, followed by a (?) major transgression soon afterwards. The period 4, 500 - 4, 000 yr BP appears to have been very dry, becoming wetter in the period 3, 000 to 2, 000 yr BP. Conditions were dry again by 1, 300 yr BP. Man appears to have been an important agent of environmental change in Central Mexico over the last 3, 000 years.

Vegetation dynamics on temporal scales ranging from 10 2 to 10 3 years were reconstructed in order to provide essential information on the temporal variability of ecological patterns and processes in these forests; information that is of direct relevance for their current and future conservation and management strategies. Vegetation and palaeoecological methods undertaken included fossil and modern pollen analysis, vegetation surveys, microfossil charcoal analysis, magnetic susceptibility, <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>geochemistry,</b> radiocarbon and 210 Pb dating. These were used to evaluate the long-term dynamics of three forest types; Pine Forest, Cloud Forest and Transitional Forest on timescales spanning the past 4260, 1340 and 1230 years respectively. The main drivers of change were climate and disturbance events induced by climate fluctuations, for example increased fire frequency. The reconstructed records indicate that the sequences from the Cloud Forest and the Transitional Forest spanned two wet and one dry climatic interval while the Pine Forest sequence spanned two dry and two wet periods. The impact of these climatic fluctuations was significant on all three forest types and resulted in variations in forest diversity, taxonomic turnover and successional change. The climate change episodes observed in these records seem to be the local manifestation of climatic events that were occurring throughout Mexico at these intervals in time. Human influences were evident in the three forests through the appearance of cultural taxa, particularly during the driest period (~ 1200 yr BP). There is little evidence from these records, however, to suggest a widespread clearance of the landscape for agriculture. Results from this study support the current conservation and management recommendations for Cloud Forest to exclude timber extraction, grazing and agricultural activities from this forest type. In the Pine Forest, human interventions such small-scale agriculture, prescribed burning and silvicultural actions are in agreement with the longterm pine ecology and as such, total exclusion of human activities is not necessary. For the Transitional Forest, results from this study suggest {{that there needs to be}} the establishment of adequate plans to reduce frequent fires to arrest the development of prone-to-fire taxa. </p...|$|R

40|$|Lacustrine {{sediment}} sequences {{can provide}} valuable archives of past environmental and climatological variability in terrestrial realms. In order {{to unravel the}} history of a lake and of a lake’s catchment, a profound understanding of the sedimentary processes is required. This encompasses the supply of allochthonous organic matter, nutrients and clastic material to the lake, the subsequent redistribution within the lake as well as autochthonous organic matter and mineral deposition. These lake internal and external processes are closely linked to the environmental and climatological settings in the specific area and can be reconstructed by using geophysical and sedimentary data. Within the scope of this thesis, modern and past sedimentary processes of selected lakes from the High Artic (Lake El’gygytgyn, NE Siberia) and the Mediterranean Realm (lakes Dojran and Ohrid, Balkan Peninsula) were analyzed by using various datasets and analytical methods. The obtained information about variations in the lakes’ internal and external processes were subsequently used for paleoenvironmental and -climatological reconstructions in the respective area. At Lake El’gygytgyn, modern sedimentary processes were investigated by using geochemical, grain-size and mineralogical data from source rocks, inlet streams and surface sediments. The obtained informa- tion about modern sedimentary processes improved the understanding of hydro-acoustic and downhole logging data, as well as of variations in the granumoleric, geochemical and physical properties of core 5011 - 1 which covers the entire lacustrine succession of the 3. 58 Ma year old Lake El’gygytgyn. Surface samples and downcore data were analyzed by using statistic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Time Series Analysis and Cluster Analysis. At Lake Dojran, hydro-acoustic data and sediment properties (water content, OM, calcite (CaCO 3) content, sulfur content, grain-size, XRF scanning, δ 18 Ocarb, δ 13 Ccarb, δ 13 Corg) of a 7 m long sequence were used to untangle past sedimentary processes and environmental variations during the Late Glacial and Holocene period. Sediment (lithostratigraphic description, XRF scanning, water content, OM content, calcite content) and hydro-acoustic data were also used to characterize a 2 m thick Mass Wasting Deposit (MWD) in Lake Ohrid. As various analytical and statistical methods were used to investigate modern and past sedimentary processes in the selected lakes, an evaluation of these methods is conducted within the scope of this thesis. It could be shown that information about modern sedimentary processes derived from lacustrine surface samples and from catchment samples can help to better understand past sedimentary processes as it provides insights into spatial variations in the deposition processes. Spatial variations of past sedimentary processes and the overall sediment architecture of lacustrine deposits can be analyzed using hydro-acoustic data. However, the vertical resolution of hydro-acoustic data is limited and the data commonly lacks a robust chronology. Chronostratigraphic well constrained and high resoluted informa- tion about past sedimentary processes can be derived from sedimentary properties of a sediment core. These properties include lithologic information such as sediment structure, grain-size, and <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>geochemistry.</b> These proxy data can be obtained by visual core descriptions and laboratory analyses. However, certain proxies can commonly only be used to reconstruct a specific part of sedi￼mentary processes, for example grain-size data yields information about the transport energy during the deposition. Thus, a combination of multiple proxies is required to reconstruct the overall picture of sedi- mentary processes. If huge data sets are used for the reconstruction, statistic methods such as PCA, RDA, Time Series Analyses, and Cluster Analyses can help to simplify the data. However, it could be shown that mathematic methods can provide results that might lead to misinterpretations in a geological context. In order to interpret sediment sequences for paleoenvironmental and -climatological variations in a temporal context, an age model is commonly established by using for example radiocarbon ages and chronological tie points derived from tephrostratigraphic or paleomagnetic data. Cross correlation to well dated sediment sequences or wiggle matching to orbital parameters can improve a chronostrati- graphic modell. However, this involves the danger of misinterpretations or loss of information about the timing of geologic or climatic events...|$|R

40|$|A {{brief history}} of sapropels The word "sapropel" first appears in the {{literature}} in 1904, when Potonié mentions that Prof. Dr. Schulze suggested that this word should {{be used as the}} international scientific term for Faulschlamm [Potonié, 1904]. Sapropel is a contraction of the literal translation of the German words Fäulniss and Schlamm into ancient Greek (F"BD`H and B 08 `H, meaning putrefaction and mud). Potonié uses the term to describe a dark-coloured sediment, containing decomposing organisms, deposited under stagnant water. Fossil sapropel deposits are subsequently named sapropelites [Twenhofel, 1926]. These terms are commonly used for organic-rich lake sediments or certain oil source rocks, but were introduced to marine geosciences by Olausson who uses the description "sapropelitic mud" for marine sediments containing more than 2 % organic carbon [Olausson, 1954]. Without calling them sapropels, Bradley [1938] predicts the occurrence of laminated, organic-rich layers in the Mediterranean, especially in the eastern basin. Kullenberg [1952] first discovered such layers in cores recovered from the Mediterranean seafloor during the 1947 - 1948 Swedish deep-sea expedition. These layers might have simply been called black shales, {{if it were not for}} Olausson [1961] describing them as "sapropelic layers". Many more organic-rich layers were recovered during Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) Legs 13 A (1970) and 42 A (1975). Examination of these sediments resulted in an official sapropel definition: "a discrete layer, greater than 1 cm in thickness, set in open marine pelagic conditions, and containing greater than 2. 0 % organic carbon by weight" [Kidd et al., 1978]. The term sapropelic layer was downgraded and since then designates a layer containing between 0. 5 % and 2. 0 % organic carbon. On the origin of sapropels Especially in the decennia since 1970, numerous researchers have studied the sedimentology, palynology, micropalaeontology and geochemistry of Mediterranean sapropels. The aim of these studies: to reconstruct the climatic conditions and hydrographic regime that resulted in sapropel formation. Currently, the Mediterranean (Fig. 1. 1) is a land-locked basin separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the shallow Strait of Gibraltar (284 m deep). Ocean surface water flows eastwards into the Mediterranean, becoming denser as a result of evaporation. Between Sicily and Tunisia, water flows through the shallow Strait of Sicily (330 m deep), which?Chapter 1 10 Figure 1. 1 Map of the Mediterranean area. separates the western from the eastern Mediterranean. Continuing evaporation finally makes the surface water so saline and dense that it sinks near Cyprus, where it starts its way back to the Atlantic Ocean as Mediterranean Intermediate Water. This anti-estuarine circulation pattern makes the Mediterranean a nutrient desert: it receives nutrient-depleted surface waters and exports its nutrients received by rivers to the Atlantic with its deep water. The same is true for the eastern basin with respect to the western basin, making the eastern Mediterranean a "nutrient desert within a nutrient desert". Present-day low surface water nutrient levels and oxic bottom waters result in deposition of organic-poor sediments (< 0. 5 % organic carbon). For the deposition of organic-rich sapropels, major changes in this system are clearly necessary. At first, the occurrence of organic-rich layers in Mediterranean sediments was reported to be linked to improved preservation of organic matter under anoxic bottom water conditions. Anoxia would result from density stratification of the water column, limiting circulation and supply of oxygen to deep water [Bradley, 1938; Olausson, 1961]. In a key paper, Rossignol-Strick et al. [1982] correlate the most recent sapropel to a period of heavy precipitation in Africa (late Glacial - early Holocene). They concluded that increased Nile outflow produced a low-salinity layer in the eastern Mediterranean, which stratified the water column, culminating in stagnant (anoxic) bottom waters and sapropel formation. A more extreme theory is that increased Nile outflow did not lead to stagnation, but to a reversal of circulation in the eastern Mediterranean from anti-estuarine to estuarine [Calvert, 1983; Sarmiento et al., 1988]. The simple link between sapropel formation and anoxia was challenged by Calvert, who suggested increased surface?Introduction and summary 11 water productivity as an alternative mechanism for sapropel formation [Calvert, 1983; Calvert et al., 1992]. In his view, organic carbon contents of some Mediterranean sapropels were too high to be achieved with present-day productivity even under anoxic bottom water conditions. On the other hand, high productivity in the Mediterranean cannot be achieved with the present-day hydrography. Calvert [1983] invoked the circulation reversal scenario to solve this problem, since with an estuarine circulation the eastern Mediterranean would be a nutrient trap. Alternatively, Rohling and Gieskes [1989] suggested that increased river water input might lead to a shoaling of the density gradient (pycnocline) into the photic zone. This would result in nutrients of intermediate waters becoming available for primary productivity in a so-called "Deep Chlorophyll Maximum". The "productivity versus preservation" debate is still continuing. De revolutionibus orbium coelestium Due to the collision of Africa with Europe, some sediments deposited on the Mediterranean seafloor have been uplifted above sea level. In these land sections, mainly in Greece and Italy, layers enriched in organic carbon are also found. "Real" sapropels are uncommon in those sections, because organic carbon levels of more than 2 % are rarely attained. Corresponding horizons in carbonate cycles in the Sicilian Trubi, Narbone and Agrigento formations are simply called "grey layers", after their colour. Organic-rich layers in the famous Vrica section are called laminites. All these dark-coloured layers are repeated monotonously and regularly in the sedimentary record. This suggests that they are part of "Milankovitch cycles", linked to the Earth's orbital cycles of eccentricity, obliquity and precession. Eccentricity is a measure of the ellipticity of the shape of the Earth's orbit around the sun, and varies in main periods of 100, 000 and 400, 000 years. Obliquity is the variation in the angle of the Earth's axis, which has a main period of 41, 000 years. Precession describes the movement of this axis around the surface of a cone, completing a full circle every 26, 000 years. These variations affect the global, seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar insolation on Earth and, therefore, result in climatic fluctuations. The correlation of the cyclic occurrence of sapropels in the Mediterranean to these orbital variations is mainly the result of the efforts of Hilgen and coworkers [Hilgen, 1991 a, b; Hilgen et al., 1995]. They developed a continuous record of sapropel occurrences down into the Miocene, and correlated each sapropel to a precession cycle. Sapropel deposition occurs during precession minima, when the Northern Hemisphere receives maximum summer insolation, and climate in the Mediterranean region is relatively wet. The correlation of sapropels to the insolation record is of great significance, because it allows accurate age determination, estimation of sedimentation rates, and comparison of individual sapropels in different settings. Geochemistry of eastern Mediterranean sedimentary cycles The majority of geochemical studies on sapropels focus on Recent sediments recovered from?Chapter 1 12 the Mediterranean seafloor by traditional coring techniques. Sediments up to 1 million years old can be obtained in this way. For the study of older sapropels, samples have to be obtained either from land sections, or by seafloor drilling techniques. In the first part of this thesis ("The Miocene"), the geochemistry, micropalaeontology and sedimentology of 7 to 10 million-year-old sapropels from Crete and Gavdos (Greece) are discussed. It has been suggested that formation of such old sapropels did not result from climatic changes caused by the precession, but rather from an overall warm climate [Cita and Grignani, 1982; Thunell et al., 1984]. However, the characteristics of these Miocene sapropels are very comparable to those of Pliocene and Pleistocene sapropels. Therefore, sapropel formation during the last 10 million years must have resulted from one basic mechanism: precession-induced dry-wet oscillations in Mediterranean climate. Pliocene land sections on Sicily are characterized by a striking alternation of grey-white-beige- white coloured sediments. The grey layers are equivalent to sapropels, but contain much less organic carbon. The formation of these carbonate cycles is still not fully understood, but must result from an intricate interplay of the processes of carbonate productivity, dissolution, and dilution by clays. At the Lido Rossello section on Sicily, six laminated intervals, some of which contain diatoms, are intercalated in the normal grey-white-beige-white sediments. In coeval sediments of the nearby Punta di Maiata section, these laminites are absent. In Chapter 4 it is discussed how these laminites may have formed, and how they are related to the carbonate cycles. It was found that they are productivity events, but there are also indications for the presence of a local anoxic basin during their deposition. A unique opportunity to study sapropels older than 1 million years in marine cores instead of in land sections was offered by ODP (Ocean Drilling Program) Legs 160 and 161 in 1995. During these campaigns, hydraulic coring techniques were used to obtain excellent sedimentary records extending down into the Pliocene. Some of the Pliocene sapropels recovered were extremely well developed, having a very dark colour, distinct lamination, and sharp boundaries. In Chapter 5, it is shown that some of these sapropels are extremely rich in organic carbon, trace elements and pyrite, and contain isorenieratene derivatives (biomarkers for photosynthetic green sulphur bacteria). These sapropels must have been formed when the eastern Mediterranean water column was almost completely sulphidic as a result of high productivity. The same sapropels feature in Chapter 6, where a detailed trace element budget of the eastern Mediterranean during their formation is presented. Calculations show that the trace element enrichment is not (solely) the result of diagenesis, and that next to wind, hydrothermal and river input, western Mediterranean seawater is also needed as a trace element source. This indicates that water circulation was not too much restricted during sapropel formation; in fact, it may have been reversed. A very efficient trace element removal mechanism must have been operative, supposedly scavenging by organic matter and sulphides from an almost completely euxinic water column. This mechanism is also operative in the present-day euxinic Black Sea. As such, these Pliocene Mediterranean sapropels are comparable to several worldwide?Introduction and summary 13 occurring black shales, especially those of the Caenomanian-Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE). However, because of the shorter duration of sapropel formation, the ultimate trace element sources are different for the sapropels (seawater) than for those black shales (hydrothermal and fluvial input). In Chapter 7, the geochemical results of all studied ODP sapropels are presented. These (partly coeval) sapropels stem from four different sites that span most of the eastern Mediterranean, and which represent different water depths. Therefore, these data offer unique opportunities to narrow down the possible scenarios for sapropel formation. It is concluded that Pliocene sapropel formation is not the result of either increased productivity or improved preservation, but that both factors must have played a significant role. Possibly, anoxic conditions developed because of high oxygen demands set by decomposing organic matter, making productivity the key factor determining Pliocene sapropel formation. Sedimentation rates were between 30 % lower and 50 % higher during Pliocene sapropel formation, which lasted between 1, 900 and 10, 000 years. Nile runoff and nutrient supply is an important factor in sapropel formation, which is reflected in longer sapropel duration in the eastern part of the eastern Mediterranean than in the western part. Because uplifted Mediterranean marine sediments in land sections are older than approximately 1 million years, a direct comparison between sapropels in marine cores with their equivalents in land sections had not been possible before ODP Leg 160. In the third part of this thesis ("The Pleistocene"), a comparison is made between a laminite in the Vrica section (Italy) and the coeval sapropel in ODP Sites 967 and 969. The laminite is quite different from the sapropel: it is much thicker, richer in clays, and poorer in organic carbon. Only a small part of the differences between the land section and the marine cores is the result of uplift, weathering and erosion. Most of these differences are due to the different settings: the Vrica sediments were deposited in shallower water, with a higher sedimentation rate, and closer to land than the ODP sapropel. Where do we go from here: Chaos or community? Even after several decades of intense research on Mediterranean sapropels, the precise mechanism behind their formation has not been fully elucidated. Clearly, sapropel formation is the result from an intricate interplay of several processes, each with varying intensity in time and place. To improve our understanding of these processes, we primarily need a more detailed knowledge of how palaeoproxies function, and what they register. The ultimate goal should be a model that can explain how sapropels are formed in the eastern and western Mediterranean, from the Miocene to the Holocene. In my view, the only way in which such a model can be attained, is cooperation between all marine disciplines: stratigraphy, sedimentology, micropalaeontology, <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>geochemistry,</b> palynology, and oceanography. The year 2004 will mark the centennial of the word "sapropel". It would be appropriate if, by then, we will better understand what this term stands for. ?Chapter 1 14 Acknowledgements - Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin, Nicolaus Copernicus and Martin Luther King are acknowledged for their contributions to the section titles of this introduction. ? 1...|$|R
