50|$|In many countries, customs {{procedures}} for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into {{red and green}} channels. Passengers with <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> (carrying goods above the permitted customs limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel. Passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the permitted customs limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, if a passenger going through the green channel {{is found to be}} carrying goods above the customs limits or prohibited items, he or she may be prosecuted for making a false declaration to customs, by virtue of having gone through the green channel. Each channel is a point of no return, once a passenger has entered a particular channel, they cannot go back.|$|E

50|$|The sermons of Kartanoism {{were best}} known for {{significant}} coverage {{of waiting for the}} end of the world. The second coming of Jesus was thought to be coming immediately, and before it, the sinful world would receive its punishment. The Winter War provided a <b>good</b> reason <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> that the Wrath of God would be wrought upon the infidels. The Kartanoists themselves thought they had founded a bridal parish for the end of times, which Jesus would embrace as his own when he came. On the other hand, Kartanoism did not try to organise itself to a separate community, instead its members stayed within the Lutheran church.|$|R

Still, Linghu, despite his lengthy service under Emperor Xuānzong, was continuously apprehensive of the emperor's strictness as well. On one occasion, when Linghu violated Emperor Xuānzong's order that when prefectural prefects who were being transferred from one prefecture to another, the prefect were to come to Chang'an so that Emperor Xuānzong could personally review their reports, Emperor Xuānzong made sarcastic remarks that the chancellor had abrogated imperial orders, but carried out no negative actions against Linghu.|$|R

"It is long ago--almost {{beyond the}} memory of us now here--since you last made a new man Consul.[172] That high office the nobles had {{reserved}} for themselves, and defended it, as it were, with ramparts.

Nor have you only made me a Consul, much as that is, but you have done so in such a fashion that but few among the old nobles have been so treated, and no new man--'novus ante me nemo.'

All this, he says, had been very grateful to him, but he had quite understood that it had been done that he might labor on their behalf. That such labor was severe, he declares. The Consulship itself must be defended. His period of Consulship to any Consul must be a year of grave responsibility, but more so to him than to any other. To him, should he be in doubt, the great nobles would give no kind advice. To him, should he be overtasked, they would give no assistance.

40|$|According to many internationalists, the {{terrorism}} detention cases Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld are exemplary {{of a movement}} {{on the part of}} the Supreme Court toward greater incorporation of and respect for international law. Recent death penalty cases, statements of individual justices, and the increasing transnationalism of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s docket have lead many to believe, as Justice Ginsburg does, that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 island or lone ranger mentality is beginning to change. 2 ̆ 2 This Article takes the contrary position that Hamdi and Hamdan are not internationalist because of their meticulous avoidance of the issue of Geneva Convention self-execution. Briefly, the self-execution doctrine distinguishes between self-executing treaties, which automatically establish domestic law, and non-self-executing treaties, which only create domestic law after executing legislation. The Constitution <b>declares</b> treaties <b>to</b> be the law of the land, and early Supreme Court cases take the view that treaties presumptively create enforceable federal law. After World War II and the birth of the human rights movement, however, activist lower courts, informed by segregationist and isolationist philosophies, cobbled together a modern self-execution doctrine that erects unjustified legal barriers to treaty enforceability. It is this modern doctrine upon which the Bush administration has consistently relied when arguing that Guantanamo detainees cannot pursue Geneva-based claims. Hamdi and Hamdan gave the Supreme Court two <b>good</b> opportunities <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> the Conventions self-executing, thereby reaffirming the constitutional status of treaties. The Court declined to do so and performed legal gymnastics in order to avoid the issue. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the Conventions allowed Congress to maintain a pretense of respect for international law, while practically abrogating the Conventions through the Military Commissions Act. In addition, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s apparent fear of Geneva self-execution evidences a disturbing internalization of isolationist ideology regarding treaties and undermines claims of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s new internationalism...|$|R

He was never an ordinary, never, in the strict sense, an amiable, man; but there was nothing in even the worst that I had known of him before, to prepare me for so strange a transformation. It was impossible to close the eyes against one fact; that he had, as the saying goes, something on his mind; and as I mentally ran over the different words which might be represented by the letter M--misery, mercy, marriage, money, and the like--I was arrested with a sort of start by the word murder. I was still considering the ugly sound and fatal meaning of the word, when the direction of our walk brought us to a point from which a view was to be had to either side, back towards Aros Bay and homestead, and forward on the ocean, dotted to the north with isles, and lying to the southward blue and open to the sky. There my guide came to a halt, and stood staring for awhile on that expanse. Then he turned to me and laid a hand on my arm.|$|R
