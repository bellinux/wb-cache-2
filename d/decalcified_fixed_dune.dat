40|$|A near-natural coastal dune {{system in}} NW Jutland, Denmark was investigated. The area {{contains}} a gradient in natural soil mobility {{with the highest}} values in dynamic white dunes dominated by Ammophila arenaria, and low mobility in <b>fixed</b> <b>decalcified</b> <b>dune</b> heath with Empetrum nigrum and Calluna vulgaris. A total of 267 plots was investigated and presence of mosses and rooted vascular plants recorded. Cluster analysis identified five communities: white dune, grey dune, outer dune heath, inner dune heath and humid dune heath. These communities were ordered along two main axes in a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The relationship between DCA axes and several environmental variables, including soil characteristics and Ellenberg indicator values, were investigated by correlation. Two major complex gradients underlying compositional variation were identified; one short coenocline with an underlying steep gradient in habitat maturity, soil stability and nutrient-limited productivity, and one longer gradient in water-limited productivity and peat accumulation only applying to the older successional stages. Distance from the coast was an important correlate {{of several of the}} measured variables. Microclimatic indices, i. e. heat index and wind index, had limited value as descriptors of community patterns as they were not correlated with the DCA axes or with other environmental variables. However, within communities the microclimatic indices correlated with several explanatory variables...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We provide several {{examples}} for the coexistence of active and 9 <b>fixed</b> sand <b>dunes</b> under similar climatic conditions, namely, {{with respect to}} 10 wind power and precipitation rate. A model is developed for dune vegeta- 11 tion cover that includes wind power, precipitation rate and anthropogenic 12 effects, such as grazing and wood gathering. The model reproduces the ob- 13 served dune’s bi-stability and shows that under intense human pressure and 14 prolonged droughts, the <b>fixed</b> <b>dunes</b> may turn active. Moreover, the model 15 shows that the dune reactivation process is almost irreversible, as a <b>fixed</b> <b>dune</b> 16 will become active only under the action of very strong winds and can then 17 return to the fixed state only when wind power decreases far below the lev- 18 els under which the initial dune maintained its stability. Similar hysteretic 19 behavior of dune mobility is predicted by the model with respect to chang- 20 ing precipitation and human pressure parameters. 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{temperate}} climates, foraging {{resources for}} pollinating insects are {{especially important in}} early spring when animals emerge from hibernation and initiate annual life cycles. One habitat, protected under EU law, which provides resources {{for a range of}} pollinating insects, but has received little research attention, is <b>fixed</b> (grey) <b>dunes.</b> <b>Fixed</b> <b>dunes</b> often contain creeping willow (Salix repens, Salicaceae), which may be an important early season resource for obligate flower visitors. We examined the springtime activity of flower visitors in <b>fixed</b> <b>dune</b> ecosystems in relation to sugar concentration and composition in nectar, composition of essential amino acids in pollen, and floral abundance. We also investigated whether {{the presence or absence of}} S. repens influenced the abundance and species richness of three obligate flower visiting guilds (solitary bees, bumblebees and hoverflies) in eight sites along the eastern and southern coasts of Ireland. Higher insect visitation rates were observed to species whose nectar contained greater concentrations of glucose and fructose. Solitary bee visitation rates were related to % Essential Amino Acid (EAA) in pollen and floral species richness. Ulex europeaus, and S. repens were the most abundant flowering species, but visitation rates were not related to floral abundance. Higher abundances of bumblebees and hoverflies were discovered at sites where S. repens was present. This study raises further questions about the nutritional requirements and preferences of obligate flower visitors in <b>fixed</b> <b>dune</b> ecosystems in spring time...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the modifications of soil factors in Carpobrotus invaded sites by evaluating differences between non-invaded and highly invaded plots in three habitats of coastal dune ecosystems in Central Italy. Nitrogen content, organic matter content, pH and salinity were measured in three coastal habitats: shifting dunes {{along the shoreline}} with Ammophila arenaria, Crucianellion maritimae <b>fixed</b> beach <b>dunes</b> and <b>fixed</b> coastal <b>dunes</b> with Juniperus spp. Soil variables of the invaded plots were compared to non-invaded ones using two-way factorial ANOVAs and post-hoc Tukey HSD tests. We found significant differences between invaded and non-invaded plots for nitrogen content, organic matter content and pH in both foredune habitats. On the other hand, no differences were revealed on <b>fixed</b> <b>dunes.</b> Thus, we found distinct responses of soil factors to Carpobrotus invasion depending on the habitat. Pioneer habitats with very poor soils are more sensitive to invasion probably because the production of litter by Carpobrotus is considerably higher than for native species. Therefore, {{for the establishment of}} efficient alien control programs of those habitats of conservation interest, it is imperative {{to take into account the}} relationship between invasive species presence and the top soil characteristics.

We explore co-variation patterns among leaf traits (size, specific leaf area (SLA), nutrient concentrations (N, P, K…), deciduousness and leaf consistence), and growth form in 78 native coastal dune species. Methods–Three coastal dunes of contrasting climatic conditions were sampled and differentiated between <b>fixed</b> and mobile <b>dunes.</b> Species were classified based on growth form, deciduousness and leaf consistence. Leaf {{samples were collected}} following Cornelissen et al. (2003) and soil samples were also analysed by ICP-OES and elemental analysis.

40|$|Coastal dunes {{worldwide}} harbor threatened habitats {{characterized by}} high diversity {{in terms of}} plant communities. In Italy, recent assessments have highlighted the insufficient state of conservation of these habitats {{as defined by the}} EU Habitats Directive. The effects of predicted climate change could have dramatic consequences for coastal environments in the near future. An assessment of the efficacy of protection measures under climate change is thus a priority. Here, we have developed environmental envelope models for the most widespread dune habitats in Italy, following two complementary approaches: an "indirect" plant-species-based one and a simple "direct" one. We analyzed how habitats distribution will be altered under the effects of two climate change scenarios and evaluated if the current Italian network of protected areas will be effective in the future after distribution shifts. While modeling dune habitats with the "direct" approach was unsatisfactory, "indirect" models had a good predictive performance, highlighting the importance of using species' responses to climate change for modeling these habitats. The results showed that habitats closer to the sea may even increase their geographical distribution in the near future. The transition dune habitat is projected to remain stable, although mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>dune</b> habitats are projected to lose most of their actual geographical distribution, the latter being more sensitive to climate change effects. Gap analysis highlighted that the habitats' distribution is currently adequately covered by protected areas, achieving the conservation target. However, according to predictions, protection level for mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>dune</b> habitats is predicted to drop drastically under the climate change scenarios which we examined. Our results provide useful insights for setting management priorities and better addressing conservation efforts to preserve these threatened habitats in future...|$|R
