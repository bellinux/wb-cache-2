40|$|Thus far, {{relatively}} {{few studies have}} focused on the IT supplier side of IS/IT outsourcing arrangements. Existing research identifies two recurring problems: (1) a lack of sustainability with regard to service performance, and (2) a poor fit between the heterogeneous context of clients and homogenous provider solutions. The objective of this theoretical paper is to relate sourcing capabilities and organizational structure of IT suppliers to sourcing performance, taking the dynamics that clients have to deal with into account. To that end, we develop a conceptual model that connects the interaction between developments in the <b>client</b> <b>domain</b> to the sourcing capabilities and organizational structure of suppliers. To be more exact, we hypothesize that realizing a fit between the necessary sourcing capabilities and organizational structure on the IT supplie...|$|R
40|$|Introduction There {{has been}} a surge of {{interest}} in ubiquitous computing {{over the past few}} years. Ubiquitous computing is an attempt to break away from the traditional desktop interaction paradigm by distributing computational power and resources into the environment surrounding the user. In the last few years, there has also been an increasing emphasis on extending the utility of information systems by providing access through mobile devices, for example, telephones or PDAs (Goose et al., 1998). Enabling access to an information service via a telephone, without the use of a computer and a modem or a <b>dedicated</b> <b>client</b> device, has the potential to considerably increase the size of the user community. In addition to offering greater convenience and flexibility, ubiquitous access to information services via telephone devices enables professionals to make use of previously unproductive time. Moreover, the use of audio input and output enables visually impaired user...|$|R
