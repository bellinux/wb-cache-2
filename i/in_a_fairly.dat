5|$|Around {{the time}} of Dr. Nos release in October 1962, a comic book {{adaptation}} of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, {{was published in the}} United Kingdom as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> high-profile American comic. It {{was also one of the}} earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).|$|E

5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} most {{significant}} difference is in Napoleon, in his clothing, and in his general stature. David's version depicts Napoleon, dressed in an immaculate, multi-coloured uniform with a billowing cape. Delaroche's version, however, sees Napoleon <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> ordinary, gray coat with {{the sole purpose of}} keeping the cold away, rather than showing him as the symbol he may have represented - that of a gallant and powerful war leader, which is the impression given in David's version.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{connected}} to I-64 via I-264, which runs from the oceanfront, intersects with I-64 {{on the east side}} of Norfolk, and continues through downtown Norfolk and Portsmouth until rejoining I-64 at the terminus of both roads in Chesapeake where Interstate 664 completes the loop which forms the Hampton Roads Beltway. Travelers to and from Virginia Beach can access the Hampton Roads Beltway in either direction from I-264 in Norfolk to use a choice of the two bridge-tunnel facilities to cross Hampton Roads to reach the Peninsula, Williamsburg, Richmond and points north. Other major roads include Virginia Beach Boulevard (U.S. Route 58), Shore Drive (U.S. Route 60), which connects to Atlantic Avenue at the oceanfront, Northampton Blvd (U.S. Route 13), Princess Anne Road (State Route 165), Indian River Road (former State Route 603), Lynnhaven Parkway, Independence Boulevard, General Booth Boulevard, and Nimmo Parkway. Streets in the oceanfront hotel and entertainment district are arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> regular, grid like pattern, with Atlantic Avenue parallel to the shoreline, then Pacific Avenue, and Arctic Avenue going further inland.|$|E

25|$|Contextual output encoding/escaping {{could be}} used as the primary defense {{mechanism}} to stop XSS attacks. There are several escaping schemes that can be used depending on where the untrusted string needs to be placed within an HTML document including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, CSS escaping, and URL (or percent) encoding. Most web applications that do not need to accept rich data can use escaping to largely eliminate the risk of XSS attacks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> straightforward manner.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} found higher traffic {{fatality}} rates in outlying suburban areas than in central cities and inner suburbs with smaller blocks and more-connected street patterns. While some of this disparity {{is the result of}} distance from emergency medical facilities (hospitals are usually built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> late stage of the development of a suburban area), {{it is clear that the}} lower speeds encouraged by the frequency of intersections decrease the severity of accidents occurring on streets within a grid plan.|$|E

25|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses has provided compelling evidence for the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra, and suggest an overall phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement. Mast's results clearly recognise Isostylis as a distinct clade, but place it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> recent position, within a clade that also contains B.elegans (Elegant Banksia) and B.attenuata (Candlestick Banksia). It falls a substantial distance from Dryandra, suggesting that similarities between those two groups are indeed superficial.|$|E
25|$|Har Karkom ("Mountain of Saffron", {{also called}} Jabal Ideid) is a {{mountain}} in the southwest Negev desert in Israel, half way between Petra and Kadesh Barnea. On the basis that the Israelites travelled across the Sinai peninsula towards Petra <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> straight line, a number of scholars have contemplated the possibility of Har Karkom being the Biblical Mount Sinai. Following this theory, Emmanuel Anati excavated at the mountain, and discovered {{that it was a}} major paleolithic cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings.|$|E
