5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that {{is common in}} conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel is {{centered}} on the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between {{the world of the}} inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death. The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

After a divorce and giving up the chance at being with Hal Jordan, he is no longer in her life and a hole in her heart has formed. While flying his former plane, the Zamarons send her one of their new violet power rings to fill it. Ferris' reunion with the violet light is not fully shown until Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (July 2009). In Tales of the Star Sapphires: Lost Love, Ferris initially <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possessed by her violet power ring as had been the case with the Star Sapphire gem. The ring explains to her that the Zamarons have changed service to the Star Sapphires: it must be voluntary and now extends to an entire violet Corps. The ring reveals that Ferris has the potential of becoming the most powerful Star Sapphire, and also has the ability of leading the Star Sapphires into war alongside the Green Lantern Corps. At the end of the story, the power ring keeps its word and does not recruit Ferris until she gives it permission. She is, however, manipulated by being told that her love (Hal Jordan) may die depending upon the outcome of the War of Light. By joining the Star Sapphires, Ferris may be able to prevent that from happening.|$|E
